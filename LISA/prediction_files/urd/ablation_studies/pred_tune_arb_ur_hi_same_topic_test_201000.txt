Good morning !
Are you a local ?
They brought my name to the table , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the table in Arabic ?
Anybody ! No one ? Well , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young century ago , I was sitting with my friends in the restaurant and eating food .
So I asked the question : Do you have a free food in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , I thought he must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what it says ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minister &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Blah said .
He was talking to me to three men , as he was telling me , &quot; If this was the last girl in the world , I would not see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic mean ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl accurately , and Jill .
How can they speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got angry about it .
Sure enough .
What is it that makes me feel proud of my country to speak my language ?
Where does this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am like many people , who reach a stage in their lives where they basically leave out everything that &apos;s in their museums , just because they like to say it and they &apos;re terrified .
Should I be bringing all my culture , my imagination , my mind and my spirit ?
We may have the most important warriors in the history of children .
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
What makes sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice for you as what he did for me .
The Arabic does not ask the needs of today .
This is not the language of Science , or research , the language that we use in universities , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we teach when we work on a curriculum project , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we preach on the iPod .
If we do that , they will outperform our clothes .
So where can I translate it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
That &apos;s a fact .
But another more important fact we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of the mother .
Research says that in other languages , you have to translate your mother tongue to get the skill .
In other languages , the primary attributes of the mother tongue are the language .
How ?
Jeffreen cellar , when he first started writing , was the translation of Arabic .
All his thoughts , imaginations and philosophy were influenced by this little guy in the village where he grew up , felt a particular joy , a particular voice , and thought about it .
Then they started writing in English , so they had enough materials .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their essays in English , you felt the same joy , the same feeling .
You can imagine that in English they are also the ancestors of the little boys sitting in the mountains , standing in the mountains of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can think of .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are affordable .
Germany , France , Japan and China are all in power .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it stupid .
That &apos;s why they use it in the wall , they spend a lot of money on the expansion and the Sun .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset we haven &apos;t yet gotten , and we want to get to this developing world .
The countries that were like us at a time , but decided to try and push for progress , research , and move to countries , like Turkey , the employees , they were able to speak their own language as they were climbing up the stairs — like Hurricane .
They kept it close to themselves .
Because if you go to Turkey or Who and the product , and it &apos;s not written on the market , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these offices , non-visual user interfaces , as we know them over time .
So to create new inventions and new facilities , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , autism , liberty , &quot; &quot; what does that tell you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a sign of the very fabric of our lives , and the vocabulary that is constrained by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will make a special tree in your brain — there are special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal notion of what we think , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our mind ?
How would you know it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Friedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , I better go and spend a lot of time talking about illiteracy .
It &apos;s that these effects remind us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker who &apos;s bored from a French .
I was asking it recently .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his wife and translate it overnight to what it means to be &quot; &quot; compelling . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The old lady abruptly called it &quot; &quot; compelling , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He wondered , how could someone really show up ?
Do they want to self-destruction ?
&apos;Bury me . &apos; ( English ) ( Punch ) This is one of the few examples .
It made us realize that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; his perception was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me for Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I feel when I hear Fridays . &quot; &quot; Billy Woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have already raised my hand and why you have taken it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And Saul has been following : And since you are me , I put my hand up
Turn it on . Turn it on .
( Applause ) So , what is it that we did for the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a way of thinking about society and we started the Arabic language Conservation campaign .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Get out the window , grab it . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protector listened a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you respond to the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t use this method , because in this way , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody says to me , I hate speaking Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be rational in the way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
It &apos;s a letter that looks like us and the way we think about it .
So this sentence : &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; Look at the right sign .
Very simple but effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the land of hills .
You see an example outside , a landscape with the letter black and white on the television , with the translation , &quot; kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really should not kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a lot easier than playing the time of humor , modern and loving .
Later on , we found boys and girls taking photos of Arabic .
Cole models for girls and boys .
We &apos;re so cooler !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; college &quot; &quot; sign . &quot; &quot; They want to confirm what they want to do , but I have to convey the word that is good and the same reality .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t shame ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to allow anyone to grow up or decide that we have a choice about language , putting pressure on us , putting pressure on us , putting our patients and thinking on us .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the rocket or anything else , we can still be creative .
At the moment , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a song or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the Global Goals .
He can re-branch the Arabic language once again .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s solutions .
But we have to know this , and we have to be sure that the solution is there , part of the solution is our guess .
Last year , what can you do today ?
Who here is Twitter ?
For Muslims , I recommend you , though , my time is over , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin word !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s no language .
You enter a virtual world with a language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back and get older .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to judge each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for the conservation of this language .
Now I &apos;ll give you a secret .
A child , for the first time , understands his father &apos;s language .
When my daughter &apos;s born , I &apos;m not going to tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I promised my daughter to come out of the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . ( Arabic ) &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , mama , &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t going to be
And don &apos;t expect anyone to know it . ( Applause ) You get rid of this cultural barrier . ( Applause )
I speak a little English speaker for him so that it reminds us that our presence is no secret , that I was being blessed with the negative habits that are asking my people to check , until you see me craving my generation , when I &apos;m faced with this generation of inequality , it does not remind us of our generation after it &apos;s no longer popular to dictatorship
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , my primary attorney was Gornett , which means I had to write a lot of magazines .
Now , when a normal person writes something , this approach works like this .
You know ... ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll be quick to start work , but in the first week , you do a lot of work and later on , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be ready , but actually the action of the army will reach its head , and then I will do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with every movement .
And then again , there &apos;s a whole bunch of research papers that you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal approach was not inevitable at all .
That was a huge job .
I organized the plan , I decided I would do something like this .
This is how it &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m going to start small , in middle months , jobs are going to grow faster , and eventually they &apos;re going to grow more like a student .
How hard learning is going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
Then there was a funny thing .
A few months ago ?
Come back and forth , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we came up with a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go home for months , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were just like that .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then one day , I went and there were three days in the DMV , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I put 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads — people shouldn &apos;t go on two roads — two roads a second roads a day in the Cambodia , spending a lot of time on the web , and
I thought , well , it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and he was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom Rivers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you about your issue . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , from today &apos;s point of view , it &apos;s perfect .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I couldn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s amazing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write a blog , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My driver is always offering me six people a bath and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my guess here was that the brain makes a difference between six people .
Understanding that I made a leaf blood vessel where I analyzed two brains of the same blood vessels and the brain of the chest so I could compress them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look deeper and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not very fashionable , but consider it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the rest of the brain is involved in playing .
Now , what does this mean for a listener ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is the best time to work . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart people will make philanthropic decisions to make meaningful decisions , but the guy doesn &apos;t like the project , so he picks up the profile , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and Tony Hading , because I know it &apos;s still happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;ll go to the synagogue , and you &apos;ll see something added in 10 minutes ?
After this , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , beginning with the conversation about the race in the TED fashion , and much later on , you &apos;ll be able to watch the videos of Tony Boy &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) It &apos;ll take a while for all of those things , so it won &apos;t save the day to do something else .
What a shame ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the basis of the happiness that you want to congratulate .
It just wants to be in the present time .
It doesn &apos;t know what the future isn &apos;t ; it &apos;s just two things : convenience and joy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you do , and you spend your entire life going faster and easier , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to conclude , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and increased generation , maybe that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed , the tribe is no longer very far .
We are a growing loser , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , deciding intellectually , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is to manage what we enjoy .
Sometimes editors seem to be right to do what is easier and fun to eat , to eat , to taste , to feel comfortable in times of opportunity .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a framework .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big cause .
And here &apos;s the key ingredient .
And for the rest of the audience , this contradiction always reaches the end , spending a lot of time in the short run , a simple and mysterious way out of the wall .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) The Dark Ages are the place where the Sun people are so familiar .
That &apos;s where dignity is at the moment when food shouldn &apos;t be dominated .
In the Dark Ages , the angels that come to you are not really a mess , because they &apos;re not right , spatial awareness , fear , anxiety , and they &apos;re in the middle of all the characteristics of hatred .
The question is , in this way , when the source is sending money home , how does the rest of us handle the polio season , which is less happy but more important ?
It &apos;s also proven that hundreds of people are protected , which is always protecting them in the right places — someone called the guests .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household thing that &apos;s more common , but when the downside is close , it becomes inevitable or then at times when there &apos;s a risk of embarrassment among people , employment reduction or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the source just drives itself .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and they asked me for a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Apparently I did it here .
I had my dream at TED in May .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and anger , something else was happening in the brain of the decisive one .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Do you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . The publisher said , &quot; &quot; I agree here . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India at minus 20,000 feet , we &apos;ll just do a mini house when we don &apos;t see India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
In six months , after two and a half months , people at TED decided to call the Koran .
I edited the web and I pasted the photos of me holding .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The guests were maneuverable , and within seconds the solar system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember being — he &apos;s scared of the house — he &apos;s walking up the tree !
And finally , and finally , the religious decision-makers picked up the boxes and I could start working on the conversation .
Now , the homeowner who talks about paragraph after paragraph , any kind of person like me , wouldn &apos;t be able to write a chapter for two weeks , and the beginning of the process is incredibly successful tools to go to the paragraph and write a chapter overnight .
And the total of three vertical axes is what &apos;s called the axis system .
It &apos;s not very nice ; it &apos;s not linear .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was struck by the impact that this had on me .
In fact , I would receive thousands of miles from all over the world and from all walks of people , who were faced with various types of rituals .
They included bankers , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and also B.S. staff .
( Laughter ) And everybody was saying one thing and saying : &quot; I am too confused . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the following email address and the number of email addresses .
People were lying around silence trying to figure out how much longer it did in their lives , about what it did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out that there are two ways to go .
Today I gave the examples , which talked about , they all had their own CD .
And when David lines up , recent effects are the key to getting the house reached .
But Costa Rica has a different kind of relationship , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any David Online .
So if you want a job that you start yourself as an arts or a business — something like an art or a business — you don &apos;t start paying attention to getting faster , to have jobs .
In addition to work , there are many things that don &apos;t even have to do online , like meeting with your family , exercise , remembering your health , finding your relationships , telling your relationships that are not being fed .
Now if the only way you can do a regular knee is to do a homework , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data lines in the context of the knee that &apos;s disappearing .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest effects are that you cannot steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of long half-heartedness that &apos;s going to take a very short look at and talk about less than just the usual suspects , the ridiculous ones .
You are suffering from bad news and bad news .
And it can be a long-term stewardship and refrigerator .
So I thought that was the reason they had an email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Toyal Tombs have been trained to supervise them , sometimes in their own lives .
The upsetting is not that they cannot pursue their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and one of the things that came out — I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of you in the U.S. have good relationships with online , but remember the keyboards when there &apos;s no digital link .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of life .
Each block means one week , it &apos;s the new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been synchronized .
I think we all need to be careful with this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the future , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to be careful with the creation of joy .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have enough homes there , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Hi .
Thank you .
( Applause )
On a typical day of U.S. and Afghanistan , an average of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan were moving from a neighborhood of Afghanistan to a region of Afghanistan , helping to provide an office for the Afghan security services to provide a security office for the Afghan security services to allow the Afghan security services to provide a funding for the Afghan sec@@
The military tool went into a period of accident , and he lived around three and a lot of things , and he watched as a child by the Cape Seventine , he watched as a child by the Cape Seventine flew to protect the victims and to bring the dead .
One of the people who knew her children , one of the surgeons , and one of the other men , Spanish , was moving to a herbal captain , and he was also moving to another Spanish printer .
In the U.S. , it &apos;s shown that the Kepler Seventon and its Spacecraft carry this mysterious magic that happens during the Gulf .
They put it into a helicopter and then you see how the captain beats up and hits him before he can touch the other one .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are really ugly things when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why it &apos;s not the way I work with people .
You know , in the Gulf , people who are wanting to surrender themselves in order to benefit others .
In the businesses , we blame people who are yearning to judge others for our benefit .
We have the electronic calculus !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just the best people .
That &apos;s why they get tired of the ice .
These improved people reach for the purpose of services , and these improved people reach towards the idea of services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have a denser environment , each of us has the ability to engage and work together , then each of us has the ability to engage and do this , and increase it so that we have the capacity to do it in others .
I &apos;ve got the privilege of meeting with some of these people , and we &apos;re going to call them Yesterday , and I &apos;ve got the best privilege of meeting with some of these people , and we &apos;re going to call them Yesterday , and they put themselves in danger so they could protect others and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and cooperation are important here .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that it &apos;s incentives , not incentives .
This is not possible for you to &quot; &quot; Stand me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It &apos;s not possible that I get two people to cooperate , and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s a fascinating thing .
Where does it come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all of these tissues are hardworking against us .
There &apos;s no personal matter .
Religion can be a lack of resources , a lack of information , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan .
And so we were ready in the form of social animals where we &apos;re sitting together and doing what I call a charity chain , as in a tribe where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was fun and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can go to sleep at night and swim around and look at some of my neighbors .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you &apos;re not risking .
It &apos;s a system for staying .
That &apos;s exactly what modern times are like .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are trying to make our lives harder or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
This economy can scale up very , very unbelievably in the stock market .
This could be a new technology that &apos;s going to disrupt your business class at night , and it could be a new technology that &apos;s going to take your business class out of the night .
Or you can have a fight that sometimes tries to kill you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but at least it sucks in your development and tries to steal your businesses from you , it sucks in your development and tries to steal your businesses from you .
We have no choice of those powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s the place where technology takes place because it believes that the direction is going .
When a leader chooses to protect and protect the lives of the people in her organization that are contributing to protecting and protecting the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to assess their personality and deep results in order for people to live and to feel secure and to feel their personal relationships , the value of the things keeps happening .
I was walking on a walking town , and I realized the fact that when a passenger attempted to run into the town before he was found it , and I looked at the staff on the front door just like he passed the law as he was crying .
Once upon a time , he was walked upon him , the first time he was trying to walk upon him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep washing machines like this ?
Why can &apos;t you keep robbing us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he quickly gave me the exact same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we like to travel to the West Airlines is not because they remain locked up to the Lamanic people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t run out of their leaders .
You see , if the circumstances are there , we spend our time and our energy protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and our energy protecting ourselves from one another , and that makes organization worse .
As a great leader , I can show you the nearest example of how to be a good parent is the nearest example of how to become a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our kids the opportunity , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the organization and the paradox , when it &apos;s needed , to give them more access to what we can do for themselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give them the opportunity to have confidence , to have access to more opportunities to do what we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve more opportunities than ever imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , and they say one thing : If you have a tough time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie has given up on the practical wisdom of employment , and Charlie has given up on the practical lack of employment .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get involved in the infrastructure of things .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will conduct you and help you , in exactly the same way that we &apos;ll do to a kid who goes to school to get a C game .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers at CEOs , that there are so many people who are frustrated and angry , some of the bankers at CEOs , that there are so many people who are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from the CEO &apos;s , who are so uncomfortable with depression and care .
It &apos;s not about data .
Instead , they &apos;ve solved the fundamental principles of calculus .
They &apos;ve driven a dense social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones as victims of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones as victims of their loved ones , but that they &apos;ve enslaved their loved ones as victims of their loved ones , and that they &apos;ve given them their loved ones to their loved ones .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do instead of data .
Can anyone guess why it &apos;s worth 150 million dollars to the Gulf ?
Why didn &apos;t Motihari have to pay 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problem with that ? Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Instead , they will submit skin data to protect people , but they will submit skin to saving people .
A mining firm in the Bubble Champs-Élysées run a mining company in the Boston Media called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who was a big business owner and ran 30 percent of their roads overnight .
Now this is a huge problem in a large mining company , and they can &apos;t overcome their farmers much longer .
They needed 10 million dollars , so many of the companies that are now involved with people on the board , and they did a very simple task .
And Bob answered that .
You see , the Bubble doesn &apos;t trust the ranch of the Gulf .
Instead , the Babylonians believe in cheating , and the harder it is to reduce heart disease , and the harder it is to reduce heart disease .
And then they developed a personal project .
That every official , from the secretary to the CEO , needs to deliver everyone at the expense of four weeks without a nap .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob explained in the program , he &apos;s very important .
He said , it &apos;s better that we all accept small decisions , that some of us are making much more money and that &apos;s how we feel .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel protected from the wealth of an organization , trust and cooperation is fundamental .
And just like nobody expected , people started businesses from each other .
The ones who were more successful did business with less successful people .
So some had to charge five shoes in order to get one to three shoes .
Knowledge is an extreme , not a reward .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing leaders , and I know a lot of people who are very good at organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs and we do what they say because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of organizations who have no choice , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and they have the compassion to see the person on the right , and they have the compassion to see the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the foreign figures that had been out in the theater , and as a way of activists , the guy eats lunch tomorrow and loses his men first , and when he eats , he saves nothing for him .
And when he came back into the field , his men gave him some of his food to eat because that &apos;s what he did .
We tell them they do it first .
We call them leaders because they risk someone else first , we call them leaders because they risk someone else .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that we can protect them from their leaders , because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them and make them better , and when we do that , natural responsibility is for our people to protect us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their blood and blood to see if their leaders &apos; dreams are becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your blood and blood to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because that &apos;s what they do for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re going to like to do for all of us ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up named Motetema in a little story about the Limpopo , which is the Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the water supply and the water supply is really unbelievable , like in moments of growth , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up at a time 11 years old , I was staying quiet with friends in the winter sleep .
The Sun in the winter is very hot .
And as I was dozing off in the street , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you invent something that just touches the skin and doesn &apos;t you have to clean up ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this one , &quot; &quot; and I went home , and I did some research and I found some surprising statistics .
Today , there are 2.5 billion people who don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four of them are in Africa , and there are only four of them in South Africa .
Different diseases fall into the environment that is the most dangerous tragedy known as a tragedy .
The reason the tragedy in the eyes is a manifestation of the degeneration of the tragedy that &apos;s happening with the naked eye may be directly inspired by the tragedy .
This disease kills eight million people a year , and one of the things that &apos;s most compelling is that to save a tragedy , you only have to give up your egos : no eggs , no vegetables , no engineering .
After seeing these statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only do I want to continue doing it , but I &apos;m doing it at least because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I got one of my hairdressers from 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , didn &apos;t have an Internet broadcast in about 20 hours of Gadband
And I looked at this as a special problem in the box .
So Mohammed said yes , our formula is set .
Now we need to be careful with this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of business-based businesses on mobile phones , and after I write my patent , I &apos;m the youngest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Not Enough ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , exposed to the world &apos;s first slogan .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a skin .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and in limited resources , what I had , the Millennium Development Goals came in with some new people , did it more , and now we have an effective paradox , which is ready for the market , but now has access to the market .
We learned some green things about DryBath accessing commercials and people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They simply buy what they need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a ticket in Alex . They buy a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how it costs more .
So we pasted DryBath in these creative milestones .
You just have to stick it in and out .
And the cool thing is , a square metal is exposed to a cage only five times .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath , the rich kids who are aware of this , at least once a week .
However , we &apos;ve felt that we can save 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever they leave the garden and we can save two houses for the children , which are already in the middle of two houses , more than two houses for the entire school district , two houses for the child .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken out our main value proposals , cleanness and sality .
DryBath is a poor man &apos;s tool and a life of the poor .
As part of the process , we &apos;re now entering a period of manufacturing labor that could be put into a retail market , and one question I need to explain to you today is , on the shelves of the Limpopo , within a week , an alphabet with 50 brands to represent a way that the world doesn &apos;t have to be rented .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , so I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And the more important thing is that I learned a lot in the early process , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I &apos;m still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African who has access to accounting , and one of the things that really surprised me , is why all of this money should not be cheated . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , interestingly , I &apos;m here to share some of the results with you today , and I was also surprised to see what are the actual causes of success in organizations , which are really the leading cause of initial success .
I believe that the NGOs are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you choose a group of people with the desire for equality and initially organize them , you will discover human abilities that have never been possible before .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why do most of it fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know that eventually what is the most important thing for success .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , reflecting a lot of my ethical ideas and misconceptions that came to me from some of the organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was building a separate business at the age of 12 , from Jennifer Health League Baseball to Kennedy School building the solar cooker , then school , when I made the low-income version .
I graduated from college , and I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve backed over 100 companies , many successes , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to make beliefs about the most successful cause of an organization or a failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there &apos;s something here .
So I named my company &quot; &quot; ideas Live &quot; &quot; the old days that you might think .
With immediate feedback , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to tackle or be skilled , is even more important than I thought .
I &apos;d never thought there were any speakers on TED last year , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s got a plan , even if I don &apos;t read a prize on me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s true for business , I think .
A team is very important in recognizing the ability to read from a car to a neighbor .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought , well , maybe the bridge is the most important thing .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear way of acting out of altruism ?
With him , it seemed to me that the most important thing was for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes organizations get a big investment .
Is that the most important thing ?
After this , of course — is it time ?
Isn &apos;t that a bad idea , and the world wasn &apos;t set for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or have they been so disturbing , already so frightening ?
So I &apos;ve gone through many of these five factors in many organizations .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in Libya , and 100 others out of that have tried to get the scientific results .
So first of these ideas on the front lines , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all sold for billions of dollars .
And on the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we were hopeful , didn &apos;t succeed .
And then I tried to incorporate all of these characters as I think these companies had moved forward .
Then in the outbreak of ideas from Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in those companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out , but the most influential was the success and failure of all of these companies , and the result struck me .
The first thing was the choice of time .
The right time is 42 percent in the difference between success and failure .
Step two is the perspective of team and church , and then thinking , being different , think separate , actually provides a third multiplication .
But it &apos;s not obvious , it &apos;s not that I think that &apos;s important , but looking at it and I realized that I didn &apos;t think that was the most important thing .
Sometimes it matters more , when it happens .
The last two , the business model and the investment I understand .
I think the commercial model still remains incomplete , because you can do business models without masking coffee breaks .
Invest also , if investment was low , but it &apos;s now increasing , especially in today &apos;s long-term , investment is simply too easy .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these dots here .
One big success is called Airbnb .
A lot of investors in this company were noticed because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put some of their houses on the line ?
Of course , it &apos;s proven wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of the mosquito is that the best business model , the workplace , and the business model is the right time .
This company came in front of the financial crisis when people needed additional support , and it made sure to help people respond to a banana in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
However , the time was right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders also had aspirations for additional income ; it was absolutely essential .
Some achievements , like Citysearch , came into play when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to look beyond the screens .
We thought that was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was the online entertainment company .
We were very interested in this . With a lot of effort and a better business model , we had to work with some of the leading thinkers at Hollywood .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broad Internet was very little .
It was really hard to see the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and finally this company revealed itself in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and reached over 50 percent in the United States of Broadband , YouTube was reached at the best .
Great idea , perfect time .
In fact , when YouTube started , it had no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
The idea is very important .
But perhaps time is important .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really hungry for your birth .
And the unbelievable thing is , the outcome is not from the outcome , because if you like something , you should stay ahead , but you have to be very reliable about time .
As I said earlier , organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help you increase your chance of succeeding , and then the world may not be the other way around .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the biggest data shark in history . &#93; &#91; Financial paper painted poor and powerful people &#93; &#91; A cross-subsidiary of a non-profit &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Robert Prize to the Global Ventures . &#93; &#91; This week &apos;s revolution was the center of the journey from geography that brought the giant
From the point of view , these papers were published from small shell companies .
We found the inner stories of the coach , the bankers and the lawyers who came in with the cassette incentives and said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a donkey company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can see a text message transfer , you can see a way to do it , how they do it .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The official of Asian Lindland is mad .
We also hear about weekday dictators from Alaska &apos;s laundry companies .
The revenue of the revenue of the two billion dollars goes to the main mother of Russia from his childhood friend , who &apos;s a popular seat .
And many brilliant people will be infected , and the rest of the story , too , will be painted with more blind instruments . I will be home .
Now that sounds like a Jesus movie or a John Gutzalah story with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that agronomists and powerful people stay in the workplace and as long as they shouldn &apos;t pay taxes , that means that official achievements like schools get less money for health and education .
And the effect of that is on all of us .
For my organization at Galapagos Vision , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people have their influence in the weapon companies that we &apos;re exploring out loud about .
I think it &apos;s a churning world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can put another company inside a company , a second company inside , so it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind it .
For organizations ruling law enforcement , it &apos;s hard to understand why it &apos;s happening .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s particularly interesting in the United States .
Maybe it &apos;s because the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in prostate companies .
That &apos;s why shell companies work , there &apos;s only a few of them in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we study the findings of Kenema Illinand or the Wall or the Mayans or the Mayans or the New Zealand , the relationship comes from the United States .
Instead , a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give a lot of information , you have to give less information to run the company than the Liber Council does .
This is how information is given to students in American schools .
It makes it easier for minority investment .
This kind of ritual affects all of us .
Now in the Galapagos Ventures , we wanted to look at how this problem works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did is we switched a campaign across 13 government companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transport a village across the U.S. to buy a house , a ship and a ship .
The heartbreaking thing was that all of the villages had provided a comprehensive suit of how the village would move its warehouse .
These were all the early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our money at all , and we didn &apos;t pay anybody any money , but this was the intention of the status quo .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual transactions .
It &apos;s not about individual lawyers who talked about cheating and proposing .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who &apos;s been trained in Sandel .
It &apos;s about system function , it &apos;s about technology , it &apos;s about water , it &apos;s about poverty , it &apos;s about insurance .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder for these kinds of situations .
It can be awesome , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , as rich and powerful people are always .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve begun to move towards transparency where the company is empowering .
This issue was put on a political agenda , but the British President David Cameron declared eight stations in a South Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , European Union is forming a central record on the global level , whether or not there are companies in Europe or are controlling them .
The evidence is that the HIV is behind it .
Difference in the map of verbal law in the center and the center , whose growth we wanted was not very high , so we turned five .
We want to look at innovations , larger sectors , which are used throughout the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Galapagos Venture .
People should be concerned about the tragedy of the commons behind barbed wire companies .
You know , they speak up , they &apos;re not good for this kind of flexibility . We do .
Politicians need to address this issue , promote a law change in access to clean information .
We can cooperate flexibly with the secrets that are responsible for the crafting and the school districts .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that the Lexus , the inventor of you , has made much more sense in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Song : Yeah , can it be true ?
This is a query — what isn &apos;t ? — that the media of the world is showing equal effectiveness to a small group of employees making the kind of information that &apos;s larger than all other media in the world .
CA : How did that happen ?
How do people form tools ?
And how do you balance them ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , there are . I can tell you , there are public services , and there are so many ways that we can get the information to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed storage keyboards to send material from one place to the Internet , showing how to travel from legal reports to Sweden and Bollywood .
We get the information that &apos;s available , through regular data , Ram Shaheen or whatever , to organize it like public news agencies , forget about it — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about presenting huge amounts of information to the public and then protecting yourself against the inevitable legal and political threats .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the devices are real , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ll always be able to find this out , and if we get to a point where we get to the point , we quickly obtain the information .
( Gunshot ) God forbid it .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of cool to me and you &apos;re kind of wondering what the codes of TED are . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , that &apos;s the call report .
It was a hidden magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had been there for 18 years .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when the book was empowered — because of the major powers of the book , they tried to figure out how to get the copy out , they bought 20 million pounds of report , one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to mobilize its political will , which was the wealthiest man — still the smartest person in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ of Kenya .
So in 2007 , we were able to do this , and we were able to do it very early in December 2008 .
When we released that report , three days after he was born , Kabash decided to volunteer with the person he was horrified at Donal Arp , so he became a report card in the shopping mall .
CA : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s — it &apos;s not taken in Kenya , it &apos;s not taken out of sync , it &apos;s changed the result of your choice .
Julin Sung : Yes . This is the headlines of Guardian , and then it &apos;s spread across all of Kenya &apos;s newspapers in Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he , after a few days , convinced Kenyan entrepreneurs that they could talk about him .
And this blog was run on the TV 20 days of Kenya , and it changed the distribution of the vehicles 10 percent , according to one online sex report , and it changed the outcome of the previous choice .
CA : Wow , so did your secret breakthroughs actually change the world ?
GG : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re going to show a little video of a couple of hand-haul flights .
It &apos;s a long video , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;ll tell you , this is a cardiovascular video .
RD : It &apos;s cool , when you reach them and steal them .
I &apos;ll see , oh , there are four with them .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s OK . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re in front of you , tell me — go away .
Have a dollar .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Gill walks . Gill walks . ( Machine noises ) Gill walks .
Hatel . Blah master &apos;s two , lah master &apos;s two .
We should move on , time is up !
Okay , we killed eight people .
Here we see two Hilly Kepler , and we &apos;re still running the plants .
Raven . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two , this is two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , shit . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hi . He &apos;s cool . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it were very effective .
We finally did a little bit of research looking at two people .
It was the first in three dimensions that happened .
CA : So 11 people in the event , two employees in the White House ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two employees in the Reuters , two small children were killed .
Essentially , from 18 to 26 people were killed .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of anger .
What was the main reason , then , that anger , you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as a huge unbalance of power .
On the one hand , some frogs go in the floor and then a kilometer away from the neighborhood starts pouring 30 miles of gallons of coastal plants into every single one of them — any good one — and they also get killed by the kids .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t brave either , because they were journalists .
Chris Anderson : According to the US intelligence agency , Brodel Manning was reported , and he said that he had acknowledged in Chester Rome that he videotaped 280,000 and a half thousand other U.S. vehicles as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Song : So we invented by accepting the devices .
The impact on this has been just over five days ago , getting 150,000 pieces and doing 50 cents .
But we &apos;ve gone around and we &apos;ve given them a proposal for the River and the American White House at the beginning of the year , but there &apos;s no correlation between them .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of devices in the U.S. private sector ...
Julie Song : We will follow them . ( CA : Will you do it ? ) Julie Song : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) June Song : Because things like this show that , in fact , what Arab states are , in these states , real human rights violation .
If you look at the blind tastes , the material is in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why should you believe the hidden information ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , the question is how important information in the world can be stored .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They &apos;re good indicators of how to keep organizations affordable , because when the data comes out , they hope to do something good , because the organizations know better , and they know the income , they also care about how to fix it .
And that &apos;s what we found in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there risks to this individually or collectively remittance societies , where there are unexpected ways to go ?
Julian Sanging : This is not what we &apos;ve done with them .
I mean , our big , well-intentioned exercise .
With information we can gather in a very specific way the information that &apos;s being collected — the information that &apos;s available to anyone else .
But there are also some mysteries . For example , your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magical secret — but we &apos;re talking about public services that come in and out of noise .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing it very passionately .
And what you &apos;ll say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is employed in the United States Senate , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something that some people like to count on other people .
Here &apos;s an American science geography report on people dying .
Which affects — but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julian Sanging : Let &apos;s ask a lot of questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter how they look , it doesn &apos;t matter how they look .
Because they see it every day .
It will change the incentives and incentives that make all this money , and that is our hope .
CA : OK . So you look hopefully at what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to get this lightning , you have to be careful with your own mind &apos;s eye ?
Julian Sanging : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the same mindset as the other mindset .
If they do that , that would be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to do it tomorrow .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , we &apos;ve all heard about this before — this is where the blind is .
You can also imagine that there would be different kinds of hurdles on the Lake and Julie .
One is the hero of the people who hope .
Or the problem .
What is the point of view from Hurricane ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! Something should be going on .
CA : These are great people , Julie , so good .
We have to try more . Let me show you one more example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t experienced yet , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story that &apos;s old , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanging : This is a model of what we do every day .
Last year — a very important line in November in Benghazi , as was happening in Mexico , but not very big .
And we had the report card — which was a very nice study about it — showed that , in fact , conservation companies had put in place and they had put in place .
And he had some former military governments and things like that .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were wondering , well , maybe this company did all kinds of competition .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know exactly , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it sounds good to see , but we can &apos;t anticipate it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter one week after the guy that wrote it , he wanted to deliver the tool for the first time . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to deliver the tool for the first time . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we need to talk about it and talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show the paper that you have the right owner ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; And then they brought us to Sri Lanka with the name of the factory , Microsoft Wide ID .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It has happened many times .
It &apos;s a way of measuring and predicting what the materials are , and that is to write and get the letters from those people .
CA : All right . So , have you ever got the information from inside the bag ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the time , we &apos;re harvesting and reforming things as difficult as possible .
Our explanation for this has been somewhat successful in the last few months because we &apos;re improving our bucket system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s rainfall .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s growing up , we have more capacity to engage with us because of our growth , and that means that we have a massive amount of public services , but we don &apos;t have enough people to be able to process this information and imagine it .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , why was a journalist or a journalist &apos;s dream ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the kinds of materials that we have in common , so we have to innovate so that we can get those people together , we have to work with a lot of sensitivity to the materials of global warming , and then less sensitive to things .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is this right ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then ran away from the north , so the two factors were affected .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so let &apos;s just say that everything together can be artificially intelligence .
Julie Song : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a hero at a young age , and you were kind of right into the workforce .
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist working as a young man .
I wrote a letter , and I was a girl at the time when this crime was happening to me .
So you have to have a word and you have to have a British accent .
I mean — there &apos;s a way for different things to be used .
Unfortunately , at that time , it &apos;s only Russian hardware that &apos;s been used by your grandmother to navigate the banks of your grandmother .
That &apos;s why the word , it &apos;s not very helpful anymore .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re running a Grandma bank account , but do you think that &apos;s your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things in your life that helped them do ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe the truth .
But the basic value : good , affordable and evil people don &apos;t get influenced ; they grow up .
And that &apos;s the green that I have learned from my father and some of the other brilliant and healthy people that I &apos;ve lived through .
CA : Brilliant and healthy people don &apos;t generate impact ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a junior man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing up , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to grow a chicken , which near the police , has a crime scene .
And this is what &apos;s been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So let &apos;s just tell us one last little bit about what happened in the United States ?
Basically , you &apos;ve done something out there , you &apos;ve had a problem with a bank , and then the newspaper there is that they &apos;ve compartmentalized the story .
Instead , they scaled your expectations .
That makes you very famous in the Ice Line . So what happened ?
Julie Song : Yes , that &apos;s great . You know .
The East Line is an economic crisis .
It was the most abundant of her .
The bubbles here were 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the nuclear weapon emerged at least five minutes before it was released , as a movie : a modern-day immigrant News Dicket , and the state of the News Redeer was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spent a lot of time , and we became very popular in the Ice Leader , I went to Ice Land and talked about this issue .
And the thing about the people there was that this shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the sixth of the people in the audience , working with some of the other international experts , we called Ace Land a new type of law , so it was a kind of freedom media , because the journalists around the world were the most secure place , the new Nebola outbreak .
A Nearby country is like the Netherlands , which means the system is going upwards from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the East Lander Parliament properly understood this .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you realize that the more expected it is to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see all that power , or is it going to be more like this ?
Julian Sanging : I can &apos;t believe where the situation will go .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure for the law of free speech and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
Which of these shots ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move it either side or side .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience here , speaking , speaking , with respect , and all the power to you .
Julie Song : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is milk .
I was walking through the halls of my childhood Connect , and I saw it in the halls .
When I got older and got back in the early 1990s , I got this call .
My team collapsed .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view , I realized somehow how how how how how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the Millennium Development Goals , everywhere I went , surprisingly , in North Carolina , Persia , or in London , there were four creatures on the front lines of Nairobi — good , dark , silent and codable .
And I thought that was kind of weird , and I was just wondering if anyone else ever got the copy of this educational model .
And when I went to visit him , I realized people weren &apos;t looking at the cartoon team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To confine the natural world with a few elements is no unusual human nature .
This is something we did 10,000 years ago when we eliminated our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s rock and heavy ; you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cars , trucks and ships .
It &apos;s also true of strangers .
You look at me on the pathways of New York City 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see pictures , posters and lawns .
But if you look at the existing distance , you &apos;re going to be only four floors — so coat , coat , but also manic .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shahari .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The Second World War made us the greatest adventure of being a hero .
During the Cold War , we developed technology , like the Sun , the Hole in the Wall , and we turned it on the side of all these things .
And since the end of the Second World War , we &apos;ve come to see the greatest increase in the capacity for months to come .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that famine and marine agriculture have increased , so within a couple of years , it &apos;s increased greater than concentration .
Now if you add fishing and military fighting , this will be equal to two Chinese each year .
My favorite example of using Chinese cooker is not the only one , because China is not the largest border , it &apos;s also the largest border .
Now let &apos;s turn to our chosen arms .
First , the United States and the West have the most utilized salary food .
The Gulf is an extremely bad product .
Only a foot forest can feed the farmer five , 10 , 15 pounds of food to get to the market .
The Indus Valley also has an unbelievable proposition .
In a study done in the Dutch University , it showed that burning hydrogen sulfide is extremely ineffective as coal mining .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the forest flowers in the forest are the mangroves .
Now let &apos;s look at these cool boys .
They check the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protecting the beaches , reproducing all sorts of important things for the beaches , the beaches , the beaches , the beasts , the beasts , and all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the forests of Management .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years eating millions of coal plants .
Another movement that &apos;s going on here called &quot; &quot; Nemo kill . &quot; &quot; This is a movie that you just saw on the track , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now there are some recent stories that young adults are suffering from diarrhea , but with it , large numbers of others are suffering from diarrhea and transform food after the birth .
And many times it &apos;s been taken out of the slums that are named after the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we &apos;d like to see on the River , which means changing it into food , which means that the ecosystem itself is storing and maintaining itself .
Then there &apos;s the second largest food diet in the United States and the West .
Tony &apos;s a global citizen .
The tuna has to close up very large areas to organize .
We also have a region called the science fiction mining archive , or the ICCAT — the Internet Conservation for Climate Protection .
Carl Spencer also volunteered to read all the songs .
We can stand for a tummy rug , but Tony &apos;s not very good at sweating .
Many people don &apos;t know , but Tony &apos;s carrying heat .
She can carry over 40 miles an hour and temperature around her body can keep warmer than 20 degrees C.
All the benefits of this melting nectar are relatively close .
The blood vessels on the floor are the blood vessels that don &apos;t feel very good .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creatures 40 miles away from the coast , they cannot stay in the floor .
Even the time has been good , it doesn &apos;t have to be good enough to be perfect .
This is my political context .
Connect was born in ancient times .
If you look at a map of the connectome , each dot is a document .
There are 3,000 signs in the politics of Connect .
Actually , I say people are growing up in concrete — ( Laughter ) if anyone solves the power of concrete , I think we can dramatically change the world .
And everywhere , these are rockets that disappear from preparing their children to go .
As a result , we went to the gymnosophist and we had a successful military coup .
When the space shuttle began , the forest was covered in six feet to form a football game .
But now it &apos;s reaching a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s a little bit of false water going on , because if you look at the footprint on the footprint , they name the footprint for peace in the footprint .
Whereas this Food Programmed Intermittently .
It &apos;s hard to say that micro-finance and micro-finance are hard to say .
But then too , the credit card industry requires that it narrowed the replacement of the post office space .
This is a system producing oxytocin that is spreading from Jupiter .
It &apos;s been seven percent since the age .
Even though we are spending relatively little money on getting to the market , we are still missing a whole bunch of small innovations .
We &apos;re not just playing milk ; we &apos;re also playing milk and eggs .
We have what &apos;s eating the fish and the fish that are eating the fish .
Because on the left , the blood and the blood vessels pay and the mosquitos pay .
I wonder if there &apos;s any passion she took , and yet she forgot about it .
India is a pre-death problem . ( Laughter ) This is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third part of China or the number of people in the U.S. each year from the sea .
The last thing for four categories is this .
The Philistines actually started as lips .
And it started to look like a local entrepreneur who saw that the next day he would never go to McDonald &apos;s .
He went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a fundraiser for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
What was more popular with the Indus script for the sea was evidence that the Indus script does not die .
So he built his lift song .
Unfortunately , the Indus script lasted for 30 centuries .
He wanted to make a 25-centimeter node , so he brought the electronic code .
This is the largest firefighting industry in the United States , 23 billion pounds a year from the Millennium Development Goals .
If we stop polling , the alternative would probably be Thailand .
Tilonia , 20 years ago , had no idea .
It changes the plant proteins in a very efficient way in animal protein , and it &apos;s costing me for the third world .
It &apos;s actually a very remarkable solution ; it grows from an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a regular fluid .
It doesn &apos;t even have the ACE and the ADHD we think it &apos;s going to live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
This represents a large part of three million tons .
One possibility that security guards have is enough to eat it ?
Can we create a path instead of giving it peace ?
There are reasons for this .
He &apos;s brilliant kids to come to the marketplace , where the average elite is the average elite , and the most effective elite is the price of India .
This is October 3 , EPA and DDC .
So this is his ability .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a pound or a pay , and we turned it into a Facebook page , we modified the leather cooker and we paid twice as much money to distribute the goods that these farmers can afford ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have EPAA and DDIY as well .
The calculus was incredibly effective .
Cooking fat is only three sides of the value chain in India .
Actually , it &apos;s about three o &apos;clock in the morning .
The ocean is three times the size of the ocean , and they &apos;re just collecting it .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our bureaucratic administration in our Western Gaza is widely used by Facebook and Netization .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , these are the major causes of sea life expectancy .
As you might think about the cloud , in all these different ways , proteins and , more than three , are highly effective indicators .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last puzzle is a question .
We can produce a mouse that can be really useful for promoting salt proteins .
These creatures should be vegetarian , they should be able to grow fast and change their environment in a way that is shaped like a slime mold , and they should be EPA , DHA , Obama and Fitch East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the last 15 years .
Whenever I say that , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the sea .
I mean , all of this is happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s a little bit subtle .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I grew up reading the brain because I have a brother who is a neurological disease deficit .
Eventually and later , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I can connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what &apos;s happening is that they don &apos;t integrate their dreams into the ordinary and the common reality , and they act on it .
So I spent my entire life studying serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my wife &apos;s program in India , where I worked at the President Financial Bank on the front lines of the Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference between the mathematical level of the brain that &apos;s generally thought to be compared to the human brain compared to the human brain that &apos;s occupying the scaffold or the blue doors ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is to actually engineer the microscopic map of the brain , what &apos;s the cell sending messages between the cells in the chemical and the amount of chemicals ?
So I had a lot of courage in my life because I used to do this kind of stuff during the day . &quot; &quot; But on the weekend , at four o &apos;clock in the evening , I was going to visit NAMI to take a visit to NASA .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I need to find out that I &apos;m standing in front of an intelligent D.C.
The left side of my brain was a nurse .
And for the next four hours , I watched my brain completely contract with the ability to understand any information .
I was able to write and write and remember something in the morning .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I brought a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that &apos;s involved in the lower part of the brain , and this is how it &apos;s put into my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that computers work like a parallel processor on the right part of our brain while the left part of our brain works like a solar processor .
Those two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the crossword puzzle that some 300 volunteers have combined .
But nevertheless , both sides are identical .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part of the brain understands totally different information , their facial expressions are on different things , and if you allow me to give you a sense of who they are , very different from each other .
Compassion : Thank you . That &apos;s it .
Audience : Yeah , it worked .
( Laughter ) The evidence of our brains is only recently and think about this moment .
Here &apos;s what our brains think about right now in the image of the brain , and it &apos;s thought organically from our physiology .
Information forms a waste of time and energy wastes throughout our entire system through the nervous system , and then it unfolds into a giant almond-shaped classroom that recognizes what exists in the present time and what is in the brain to feel and what is in the listening .
I &apos;m an energy geographed by the energy of my surroundings through the consciousness of the left brain .
We are the energy systems that are connected from each other through the perception of the left part of the brain as a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers on this planet whose wisdom is to improve the world .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is based on the fact that our greatest alliance / cloud is now beginning to collect analytics and then assemble analytics .
And it also connects all of this information to organize and to connect with all of the things that are happening in the past that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely , the effects of our projects .
The symbols on our left correspond to the tongue .
It &apos;s this constant conversation that connects us and our inner world to the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me how to go home and buy and remind you of it .
I need them tomorrow . It &apos;s my philosophy book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps most important is the voice that says , &quot; I am ! I am ! &quot;
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become divided .
I become the only one who has access to good energy around me and with fire .
And that &apos;s the only part of my brain that &apos;s involved in that morning &apos;s attack .
On the morning of the college , my left eye was shut down with a broken nose .
It was this kind of pain that had been suffering from some kind of anxiety .
And that pain drove me like a wound and relaxed me .
And he leaves , and then he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never suffered from any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way I start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to the locker and I sat on my cartoon camera , which is the previous physical exercise machine .
Now , I &apos;m fascinated by this device , and it really feels like I have a hand that &apos;s sort of like the oldest person who &apos;s ever wrapped Donna .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s kind of weird . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , that sounds like a really weird and poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I &apos;m perceiving that has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being , who &apos;s sort of didactic in the mirror of that experience , but now I &apos;m
And this was all very strange and poor , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started running around the room , and I realized that everything in my body was simple .
And everybody is thinking very hard and very hard .
I have no relationship with speed , and I think there &apos;s a housekeeping problem , so I just have to focus on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my underwater house ready to stay underwater , and I &apos;m actually living a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , and I have to play you now .
Then my foot goes down , and then my balance is not going to fall apart , and I &apos;m going to wave through the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t recalibrate my body &apos;s suffering anymore .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to end because my hand is attached to Adam and Michael &apos;s wall with Adam and Michael .
If I understood something , it was energy ...
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the stuff on the left of my brain got so quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s been speaking the TV with a remote control .
A blood vessel .
So first , I was struck by the trauma of my brain .
But then immediately , just like the next light switch on this huge spacecraft around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt so proud and so strong .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel went to my left side of my brain and he told me , &quot; Come on , you &apos;re a member of a mustache . &quot;
We should be helpful , and I told myself I &apos;m really troubled by any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really troubled by the problem , but I came back very instantly in the same context that I call a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think of it as a place that &apos;s beautiful where you &apos;re completely tired of this tiny brain that &apos;s sticking you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere where where where my neighborhood is pushing forward .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And compare all of your relationships outside the world , and some of them have been degraded .
And I felt a sense of peace and anger .
And look at what it would look like if you flew back from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you had stayed up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I came up with a cultural norm .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , give me two .
We need help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should help me be proud of this , so I rented myself from the rich home , and I came out of the car park , and I &apos;m now walking my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking now I &apos;m working , can I drive ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s when my mother has absolutely passed away .
It was then that I realized that my God was going to attack me , the next thing that my mind is telling me is how wonderful this is .
( Laughter ) Sounds cool !
There will be some brain researchers who will recall the time to realize that they can consciously contract their own brain , and they can move into my brain . ( Laughter ) Then came into my brain one minute . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very well-known woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to judge . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fight flight , but I &apos;ll come back to my normal in a couple of weeks . OK .
I have to call for help . I have to call my work . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the work that I did , and then I remembered that I had my own business card on which my phone number is .
Then I go into my studio and I haul out a three-inch card frame .
And I look at the top card , while I can see the clearest eye of my brain , what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s my card , not because I don &apos;t see any marks around the world .
And the definition of the word &quot; &quot; paper maps &quot; &quot; is held by the marks and the marks , and I was missing something .
And then I started waiting for what I call the exhibition book .
And at that point , the typical truth was repeated , and I learned that this is not a card ; this is not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download a single inch .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the gymnosophist were on the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I have no option .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I &apos;m going to look at the cards , and I &apos;m going to look at the toys that are on the iPhone , and I &apos;m going to look at the cards .
But then I turn to my left when I didn &apos;t remember when I came back , that I made that number , that I didn &apos;t .
So I raised my hand like a dagger , and I put it on Indians , and then I put the girl in their hand , and then I came back to the normal truth , and I can tell you that I went back to India first , and I went back to all of India and I heard that the phone was on the cover , and one of my cousins called me and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
Then I say to him , &quot; I &apos;m speaking clearly in my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And the voice for me that says something like &quot; &quot; Wooo , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule , &quot; &quot; and then I realized that I had no idea that I could speak a language and understand it unless I tried to .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And shortly thereafter , there was a four-way street across the Boston Sea from one hospital visited by Massachusetts General .
I walked up and looked like the child of a fox .
Just like the one cloud in which the remaining accident took place and just ran out of poverty , I pulled out my energy and I was feeling helpless .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer a preacher in my life .
Or perhaps my doctor has saved me and offered me a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I left , I was just so surprised that I still lived .
When I experienced my spirit , then I told God to save life .
Now my brain was divided into two different facts .
At that time , my emotional memory system started to fire , which was only in the form of suffering .
The light changed my brain like the fire in the forest , and the fire was so intense and so bright that I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , or I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , and I was just scribbling through the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t really understand the anatomy of my body , so I felt enormous and wide , like someone who had been released from their bones .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a huge hero running through the sea of rain .
Great Firewall .
I found the quality that matters .
And I was reminded of that , and I was thinking that it was never possible that I would discover my greatest sense of humility and my ability to learn within the small body .
But that &apos;s when I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I still live , and I am brought to sleep .
And if I &apos;m married to the neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , then whatever life it is that neurons can get , and I &apos;ve seen a world full of beautiful , fragile , comfortable and loving people who know that they can someday feel that quality .
And they can organize and choose , well , the fact that the book wants to move past its left-hand part of the brain to search for this comprehensive quality .
And then I understood how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of verses that taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a period of intense destruction , the south center of my brain bleeding away a piece of blood from my brain that was attracted to the severe capacity of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photograph of my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of commercial life , the power of hand , and two extremely good brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world where we are and what we want to be .
Same place : &quot; &quot; At the same time I can step to my right side of my consciousness &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty-five beautiful cells are made of cellular matrix , one in which they &apos;re all in .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual , in a tiny way .
From chemical fertilizer , Al Gore .
I &apos;m a pediatrician , a neuroanatomist .
The inside of me is us .
Which would you choose ?
Which one do you choose ?
And where ?
I think every time we spend our left-hand correspondence on the electrical activity of our right brain , we will increase world peace and our planet will be so safe .
And I thought that was important to solve this idea .
Thank you .

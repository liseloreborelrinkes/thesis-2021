Good morning !
Are you people there ?
They brought my name to Twitter , but I want to ask you , did anyone here write their name on Arabic ?
No ! Anybody ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little while ago , I was sitting in the restaurant with my friend and I was eating free food .
So I asked the question , do you have a Libra in Arabic ?
He looked at me strange , he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Solly ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The Council of Divine , in Arabic . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Gosh , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Boy said .
And he was talking to me , like he was saying to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world I would not see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A Danish teenager took two words and placed a girl specifically in the name of Jill .
How could he speak like that ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s stopping me from giving my language to my country ?
Where does that happen ?
How did we get there ?
Now while we &apos;re there , there are many people like me , who are reaching a stage in their lives where , regardless of what &apos;s going on in their backyard , it &apos;s only because they &apos;re so much more popular and so damn popular .
Should I be bringing my whole culture , my ideas , my spirituality and my sisters ?
Perhaps we have the most important battles saved in the stories of children .
Should they recite all that I learned in Arabic ?
to produce those ?
How does it work ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision about compassion in the way that it did for me .
The Arabic language does not ask what today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or research , or language that we &apos;re using in universities , a language that we use everywhere in the workspace we look at when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s definitely not a language that we preach to WISER .
If we do , then they will follow our papers .
So where can I explain it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s true .
But there &apos;s a second most important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of the mother .
Research says that in order to have skills in other languages , you need to translate your mother tongue .
In other languages , creative appearance is the main building block of the native language .
How ?
The Jennian cell type , when he first started to write , was using Arabic .
All of their ideas , the imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a sense of gratitude , a special voice , and thought about something special .
So they started to write in English , and they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their translations in English , you felt very happy , you felt the same sense .
You can imagine that these are also their gifts in English , these are the little boys who were sitting in a chair in the front of the Lebanon .
Now , this is an example that nobody can do .
And second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s happened in developed societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China all have this in common .
That &apos;s why they set laws to protect their tongue .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in products , they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know any better ?
Right , we &apos;re not from the developed world , it &apos;s an advanced thought we haven &apos;t yet gotten , and we want to move to the developed world .
The countries that were like us in the one time , but they decided to test for progress , research , and move to those countries , such as Tumblr , Ukrainian , and they snuck their language together like they were peddling the skills . Like Hasbro .
He got it near him .
Because if you go to a market or a car and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You &apos;re not going to believe these are local manufacturing .
And they will be joined in these unknown consumers , as we know them more time .
So to create new inventions and new facilities , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Autism , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you ?
What does that tell you ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how and where .
Language is not just about talking , it &apos;s only about the words that we have .
Language is a sign of a very specific set of steps in our lives , and the words that are connected to our emotions .
So when we say . &quot; &quot; Autism , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special circuit in your brains . Special emotions are in a very specific date in a very specific history .
Language is not the name of taking one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal thought that has to do with what we think , and how we view each other and how we view ourselves .
What is our minds ?
How would you not understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , then I better go and spend a lot of time talking about insurance .
It &apos;s just that the expression reminds us of a special thing .
I have a French speaker friend who &apos;s a French speaker .
I was getting asked this recently .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to meet his wife and translate it one night to what it means to be &quot; &quot; compelling . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Black Woman said , &quot; &quot; Cruelty , &quot; &quot; and then all night I tried to understand her .
And he was wondering , how could someone be so obvious ?
Does she want to be a suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Together , this is one of the few examples .
And it makes us feel that he doesn &apos;t understand the word , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; he &apos;s a different way of thinking about it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , he listens to me FedEx , and one night , I tried to translate it to feel what I feel when I hear FedEx . &quot; &quot; Mother women tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and you got it . &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said this : And because you &apos;re me , I put my hand up and you leave . &quot; ( Laughter )
He translates . He shows me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to break the Arabic language ?
We changed it for a society , and we started an Arabic language conservation campaign .
As many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Leave the cold , slow down . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protection campaign heard a saying , &quot; I speak to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t understand this way , because in the way , we didn &apos;t understand them .
And if someone says to me , I hate in Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be responsible in a way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
It is in the way that the letter looks to us and the way we think .
So this sentence : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; The right teacher sits .
Very simple , but powerful .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the iceberg .
You , you &apos;ve seen an example out of it , in a context with the letter black and blue on the screen , with the challenge , &quot; Take the language . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t have to death our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to know for ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s too late for us to play the time of rage and modernity and religion .
Later on , we found boys taking Arabic characters and taking pictures of girls .
Cole models of boys and girls .
We &apos;re so cooler !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I will say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to make a point that they want to make , but I have to say a word that is so good that is actually the same .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money ! We shouldn &apos;t give up on ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to tell them that we are not going to let anyone make a fuss or think that the way we have a language is available to us , to press it , to follow our patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t get to the skin or we can &apos;t redefine the rocket , we can be creative again .
At this time , every single one of you has a creative plan .
You have a way to create in a mother tongue .
Let &apos;s start with today .
They write a word or make a short film .
A single note can be replaced globally .
She can re-grade Arabic .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we have to know , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , we have to be part of the solution .
Honestly , what can you do today ?
Which of you are Twittering ?
In compassion , I forget you , even though my time is up , or Arabic , English , France or China .
But the figures , the letters in the Atlantic are not going to write Arabic !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spam ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Two , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to one another .
We &apos;ve come here to enjoy the desecration of this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child is first heard of his father through a language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , and I made a promise to my daughter in the store , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot; &quot; No , Mom .
And it is not expected that no one would ever have heard of it . ( Applause ) Well , you &apos;ve been able to graduate from the cultural press . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak a little bit about English to help us remember that we have a deep secret , that we have no privacy , that we have no privacy , that we have visions of people who are peddling me until you see my generation , we have visions of inequality , and we have visions of inequality , and we have visions of our generation as never known as nations , as none of our activities
( Applause )
I love the chocolate data .
In college , my primary value-driver was a movement , which meant I had written a lot of devices .
Now an average person , when they write something , has something to do with it .
You know — ( Laughter ) may you like to start working really quickly , but first week we do a lot more work and then much more quickly , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be everything , but it &apos;s actually going to get at the head of the movement , and then I &apos;m going to do something like that .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what will happen with every movement .
And then you have these new pages of research , aggression that you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal response was not challenging at all .
That was a huge job .
I plan , I decided I would do something like this .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a work , in the middle of the months , I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard would it be to read ?
That &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ?
He comes and goes , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a magnificent project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then she was going to be a chef , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were just there .
And two months were changed in a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went away one day and I spent three days in the auditorium , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I put 90 pages , I went out on two streets , people didn &apos;t have to go on two streets — people were walking through the classroom , spending time in the classroom , and I left them on the radio .
So I thought , this is it .
I got a call one week later , and he was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you tired ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to your ranch . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , this is the best . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I was not sure . ( Laughter )
He was so generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited from that moment , when you all were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , they &apos;re very powerful .
Well , today I am blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
Some years ago , I started writing about lists .
My behavior always lists people up and down , and I wanted to tell the six people what &apos;s going on in the brain and why we &apos;re so .
Now my hypothesis was that the brain makes a difference between the six people .
Find out , I took a lab where I could look at the brain of both these brains and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , well , it &apos;s a little different .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , you &apos;re not a teacher , but consider it .
So here &apos;s the brain of a human .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the rest of the brain is in favor of having fun .
Now , what does this mean in a test tube ?
It means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Workforce is the best time &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &#93; The smart man will make a decision to make a point , but he didn &apos;t like this plan , so he listens to the audience , and he says , &quot; &quot; Keep the page of the chocolate , &quot; &quot; and write to the science fiction writer , because I know it &apos;s just happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we go to the next level , and you &apos;ll see , in 10 minutes , something new ?
Then you look at YouTube , beginning with a talk about the theme of Richard Fund , and much later on you will be able to watch the Internet for Tumblr &apos;s Mother .
( Laughter ) It &apos;ll take a little time on all of those things , so it &apos;s not going to take time to do anything else today .
How sexy ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the foundation of compassion you want to call for .
It just wants to be in the present .
It understands the unimagined future , and it &apos;s only about two things : compassion and mercy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all well .
If you can and you spend your entire life going forward , then you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make that , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thinking , and increasing talent , in the long term , that may be what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t , the tribe is not very remote .
We are an advanced tradition , and we don &apos;t even know it .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain that &apos;s deciding , intelligent people , that we can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are remoter .
We make big plans .
And he thinks about all of these things .
And all we want to do is share the way we enjoy it .
Sometimes it seems just the right thing to do that which is easier and more pleasant to eat , to sleep or to feel good about the opportunity at times .
Here &apos;s why that &apos;s the case .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult , for a big cause .
And this is the critical difference .
And for the rest of the audience , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends more time in the short term , a simple and consistent way that the rest of the audience can go .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) The playground is a place that people are very familiar with .
There &apos;s an animation in that moment when courage should not be driven .
The extra stuff that you find in the dark matter is not actually the fun , because it &apos;s not the right thing , the space crime , the fear , the courage , and the feeling of hate itself — all the characteristics that are in the good lists .
The question is , in this way , when the basic problem is running the command , how do the rest of us handle the Libyan Olympics , which are poor but important ?
As it turns out , the Sistine people are also safe , and they protect it all the time in their exact moments — someone called him the home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a house that &apos;s mostly sweeping more , but when it &apos;s closer to the data online , it &apos;s fine to be inspired or then , when people are at risk of embarrassment , jobs or scary results .
And the key thing is , it just gives the intrinsic .
Now , this has been a relation in my life , because six months ago , people at TED had called me and they gave me a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Well obviously I did .
I had a dream come to TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) However , in the middle of my jihad , there was something else going on in the brain that was making these decisions recently .
&quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We should just start working on it . The principal said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India down to 20,000 feet , and we &apos;ll just break it down until we see all of India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided that they wanted to know the names of the clerks .
I broke the Internet and there was a picture of me holding leaflets .
And let &apos;s see who &apos;s got it ?
( Laughter ) The house was under control , and within seconds the whole system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember the winner — she &apos;s afraid of the household — she rolls up and down the tree !
And finally , at the end of it , recent officials actually managed to send books and I can start talking .
Now , the homemade player who &apos;s blamed for every kind of crazy idea , someone like me would give two weeks to me and the beginning of the article can &apos;t be written , and then , incredibly , incredibly successful breakthroughs the night go and write .
And three key ingredients at this time — the system of the listener is called the system .
That &apos;s great , but not good enough .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
What struck me when I wrote this was the impact on this .
I &apos;ve actually received thousands of miles from around the world and from people , from different types of vehicles .
They included bankers , bankers , engineers , petitors and CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them said one thing and wrote : &quot; I too have this problem . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the following email and the email address .
People were making a fuss about what was going on with these people , and they were writing about how much on earth he did on earth .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system &apos;s right , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are all of these people in the dark ?
Well , it turns out there are two types of the list .
So today I gave you four examples , talking about things , all of them online .
And when the data is online , recent incidents are key , because the household that comes in .
But there &apos;s a second kind of cylinder on the sidewalk , and it doesn &apos;t correlate with any data .
So if you want a job to start yourself as an arts or a business — some kind of arts or a business , as long as you don &apos;t start paying attention to getting in the way , to have a job .
Also , there are many things that don &apos;t get stuck with things like alcohol with your family , exercise , feel your health , feel your relationships , feel good about the relationships that don &apos;t get stuck .
Now , if the only way to crack the skin is to crack the skin , it &apos;s hard , because all of the data that &apos;s created in the context of the house is gone .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The upsetting is that you can &apos;t get them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of long lineage to what &apos;s often brought to see and talked about less than the available critical mass , but the playful state of the art .
You are pathologically damaged .
And it can be remoteness of the long tail and the long tail .
So I thought that was the reason they email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the rain .
They &apos;re not set for a plan .
The Golden Rule has seen them , sometimes in their lives .
The trouble is not that they cannot fulfill their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all of the email and there was one thing that was — I think there weren &apos;t a lot of people there .
I think all of you are .
You may not have a very complex situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) and may have a good relationship with some of the data online , but remember the tricks when there &apos;s no data available .
Now I want to leave you with one last thought .
I call it the Kandler of life .
Every block means a week , it &apos;s the new year .
These are not very many blocks , especially when some of them are expensive .
I think we all need to be able to navigate in the browser .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the bush , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to be careful in the face of compassion .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have that many families there , so maybe we should just start by doing this .
Perhaps not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know it .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eighty-one day , a group of Americans and Afghanistan were passing from one area of Afghanistan to another part of Afghanistan , and they were passing from one of the areas of Afghanistan to helping one of the federal government officials have helped them protect an FBI agenda to protect an FBI agent &apos;s work , so that they could protect an FBI agent from a federal campaign that would have helped them protect a
The military tool came in at the height of an assault , and they were surrounded by three men and with a lot of things to surround the Cape Town as a child , and you were seen as a child of the Cape Town , and you were seen as a child to protect the spies and to extract the dead .
One of the guys who knew her children , one of the surgeons and one of the Spanish medical adventures , was moving up to a Hillel cafeteria and he was also moving up to a Hillel poster .
So it &apos;s shown that the Copenhagen and Isaac are picking up this really thoroughly thoroughbred thing .
They put it into a heavy helmet and then you notice that the Copenhagen can be thrown away before they take care of others .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are the most emotional things you want to do .
There &apos;s a love and I knew why it &apos;s because I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , they forget you in the pocket for people who are yearning to experience themselves in order to help others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are yearning to value others so that we can help .
We have an online computer !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that they were better people than others .
That &apos;s why they get stuck on the fire .
These improvers seem to be disrespectful to the imagery of the services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have an environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , so that each and every one of us has the potential to be able to connect and do this , and make it so that we have the potential to do this in others .
I have a brilliant privilege of getting to know some of these people who we &apos;ll call &quot; &quot; mother &quot; &quot; tomorrow , and I have a brilliant privilege of getting to know some of these people here yesterday , and where they put themselves at risk to rescue others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a profound sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that they &apos;re rooted not obstacles .
You can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; rescue me , &quot; &quot; and you do .
It might not be that I gave two people the chance to collaborate and that &apos;s what they did .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s a spam .
Where does it get from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , to the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all of those slaughters , we have a very strong point for ourselves .
That &apos;s not personal .
Dreading is a lack of resources , but it &apos;s a long-term TEDster , and it &apos;s all that &apos;s working together to reduce the longed-term waste of our lives , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce the longer term of our lives .
And so we were ready in the form of social animals , where we &apos;re sitting together and acting together as a part of a sacrifice , as we did in a tribe where we felt about our personal relations .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we were connected and we were connected together .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can stay late at night and I can drive to see any threats in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , that means you don &apos;t look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a system that &apos;s built for staying .
The modern distance is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world full of hazards that are trying to make our lives harder or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our opportunity to succeed .
These economies can scale up very dramatically .
This is a new technology that can be disrupted by your business strategy at one night can be a new technology that your business strategy can lead to and run at night .
Or you may have a fight that &apos;s sometimes trying to kill you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it drives your development and your business effort to drive away from you , it drives your development and your business to work hard to drive .
We have no respect for these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it never ends .
The only driver of change is the conditions in which an organization takes place , and that &apos;s where the leadership takes place , because it is the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the preservation and the lives of the people in her organization that are supposed to protect and live their lives , and that is to assess their role and benevolence in order for people to be there , and to value profound results that they have in comfort and to feel secure and to feel good about their personal relations , the knowledge of the good things .
I was on a rough journey , and I noticed an incident that when a passenger had tried to go to where he &apos;d stopped and I noticed the staff on the doorway to get to this man just like he had a piece of legislation , he &apos;d stopped .
Once upon a time I tried to walk on him , he was stunned , an attempt to stand on him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep cutting things like this ?
Why can &apos;t you put a horoscope like us and human beings ? &quot; &quot; And as it turns out , that &apos;s exactly what he said .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West billions is not because they keep the Lamanic people tuned .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up on their heads .
You see , if conditions are violent , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and therefore weakens the organization .
And as a great leader , I can show you the most prominent example of how to be a parent is a good leader for having the best example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent looks like , what would you like ? What is it that makes us ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our kids the opportunity , education , discipline , whatever it is they want , to give their children the opportunity , education , discipline , whatever it takes , to give them the tools to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for themselves to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people the opportunity , education , discipline , whatever it is they want , to give their people the opportunity , education , discipline , whatever it is they want , to give them the opportunity to have the time and to act so that they can achieve more success beyond what we &apos;ve never imagined , so that they can achieve so much more success with what we &apos;ve never imagined .
Charlie Kump , who &apos;s the Next Jump in New York City , is the head of a technology company called Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the head of a tech company called Next Jump in New York , and they said something like , if you have a tough time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization , and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has fallen in love with the practice of sanitation , and Charley has lost the practice of sanitation .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get stuck in traffic .
Instead , if you have an issue , they &apos;ll conduct you and help you , in the same way that we do for our kids who come to school and take the grades .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s the reason that so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at the CEO , and that &apos;s the reason that so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at the CEO , which is that so many people are so angry and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at the top , whose behavior is uncomfortable and uncomfortable .
It &apos;s not about data .
Instead , they followed the fundamental laws of gravity .
They &apos;ve driven a profound social society .
We know that they have saved their waste from being the victim of their peoples , and we know that they have saved their waste from being the victim of their peoples , but rather that they have perpetuated their waste from saving their people , and rather than that they have saved their waste from saving their lives .
It &apos;s something that compares to us , not data .
Is there a reason that it could be worth 150 million dollars to supply chains ?
Why didn &apos;t you give them 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with it ? Of course not , at all .
good leaders will never sacrifice people to protect data .
good leaders will never sacrifice people to protect data .
Instead , they &apos;re going to conduct skin data to protect people , but they &apos;re going to give people skin data to save .
They run a mining company in the Baby Chamien Media Collaboratory , and they run a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they &apos;ve gone to the top 20 percent of their caregivers overnight .
Now , in a large mining company , that &apos;s a huge problem that &apos;s epidemic and can &apos;t oversimplify their fate anymore .
They needed saving 10 million dollars , so today , companies like many buckets have gathered together and did some life-changing practices .
And Bob turns it on .
You see , the boy is not believing in the script .
Instead , the bubble is trusting the growth of the body , and it &apos;s hard to reduce the deaths , and it &apos;s hard to reduce the deaths .
And they created a dedicated program .
that every official , in order to get from the Scripture to the CEO , needs to give everyone a quarter of a week of irrelevance .
They could never do that when they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But the way that the bus was published is extremely important .
He said it was better that we all had a little bit of a damage to some of us , and instead of taking much more damage and getting angry .
They saved 20 million dollars in that way , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization with a sense of trust and collaboration .
And basically , as nobody expected , people started to buy each other .
The ones that were most successful did not have good enough business with the brothers .
That is , somebody took five weeks to recover from each other just three weeks .
Bias is a criteria , not a criteria .
I know many people who benefit from the most profitable markets in organizations , and I know many people who are at the top of the pyrotechnics for organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs , and we do what they say , because we have access to them , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are at the very end of the organization who don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the person on the left , and it &apos;s because they have so much control to look at the person on the left , and they have so much more courage to look at the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the formerly scientists who were outside of the theater , and as activists use the way you eat honey and you feed your friends first , and when they eat , they save nothing for it .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his food to eat because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We tell them to lead .
We call them leaders because they take risks first , we call them leaders because they take risks first , they take risks .
We call them leaders because they choose to be a victim so that people can be safe , and we call them the leaders because they choose to be a victim so that their people can be safe , and we call them the leaders because they choose to be the audience so that their people can be safe and that &apos;s how they benefit , and when we do that , the natural response is that our people have to bear .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their facial nerve so they &apos;ll see the dream come true , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your tissue and your facial nerve to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they too do this to us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization that we &apos;re going to like to work with ?
And isn &apos;t that organization that we want to all work for ? And is that not the organization that we want to work for all of us ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story about the Limpopo , the Limpopo and the Mpumbai border .
Where water and water is really unbelievable in the same way as this , and it &apos;s really hard to grow up in these circumstances at a time when I was 17 years old , I was staying still with friends in the winter with my friends in the winter .
The sun is hot in the winter .
And as I was walking in the street , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t touch you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I have to buy this . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I found some amazing data .
Today there are 2.5 billion people who don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four million of them are in Africa , and there &apos;s only one in South Africa .
Different diseases are found in the atmosphere that is one of the most dangerous things known as trchromosome .
A reflex that &apos;s injured by the loss of the eye is a reflex that &apos;s more than one of the tricks you can be able to be injected directly .
This disease consistently inspires eight million people every year , and one of the most scary things is , you only have to give up on your own egos : no egos , no tools , no engineering .
After I looked at the graph data , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s okay , I don &apos;t just do it for myself , and I don &apos;t want to mess it up , but I &apos;m doing it for less , because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I went out with my brother &apos;s 6234 camera phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a Internet broadcast
And I started to look at this as a very specific problem in the box .
So , we were ready , we were ready .
Now we need to process this .
Four years later , and after I got the mobile phone 40 page full of businesses on the phone , I am the tiniest patent holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; now and Miss ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first slum replaced .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a skin .
( Laughter ) So after trying to impact it on the high school and the limited resources that I had , the middle University of MIT brought in some new people , further it , and now we have an impact on what &apos;s happening to us , which is ready for the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned a few lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large amount .
They just buy it under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cigarettes . They buy a lot of cigarettes every day , because it just holds a lot more money .
So we built DryBath in these creative blocks .
You stick it in between and outside .
And the best part about it is , a simple replacement of a slum is only in five .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about how to look at products .
We even want the rich kids who are aware of these things — ( Laughter ) once a week .
After all , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water on the average , whenever they leave and we could save two houses for children who live in rural areas , two hours , more for a school more than two hours for a school , two hours for more than two households for children .
After we look at this global impact , we &apos;ve taken out our key values , health and series .
DriBath is the service of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re actually entering a period of time when we put this into a market mechanism , which can be put into a market retail , and a question for my audience today , at the Limpopo Current , at the Limpopo Current , we &apos;re actually presenting it with a 50 ranch in a week that doesn &apos;t have to go blind .
What &apos;s on you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished , I haven &apos;t finished .
And one of the most important things is that I learned a lot in the course of this rehearsal , last year Google ended me as the world &apos;s most teenager .
I &apos;m still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that comes with this academic , and one of the things that surprises me is why all of this money didn &apos;t want to go blaming for it . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , what I &apos;m going to do today is share some of the results that are out there , and I &apos;m also rather surprised to see what are the leading causes of success in organizations that are actually making progress in the first place .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to create a better place in the world .
If you pick a group of people with the desire to equality waste and organize them in the beginning , you will be as young as the human capabilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if the original organizations are so good , why is the majority of the failure ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success in the first place .
I wanted to be very organized about it , chasing most of my wrongful beliefs and misconceptions that led me to some of the other institutions in the past .
I wanted to know this , because I was teaching various other firms from the age of 12 , from January High School , to downtown Kandinsky , when I was making solar electronics , then to college , when I was making radio .
I graduated from school , I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started in Libya , in the last 20 years we &apos;ve made over 100 companies to make a lot of progress , and a lot of big breakthroughs .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to outperform theorists as the greatest cause of success in organization or in failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there is something .
So I named my company Aida Lib , the very first moment you feel about something .
So with that , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to control or be inspired , is much more important than I think .
I never imagined that there would be a TEDster here , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a plan for everybody , until I don &apos;t have a plan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
The ability to connect a team to move past coal is critical .
Cooking is an honest reality .
So I thought that maybe the team has the most important value .
So I started to look at the business model .
Does an organization have an explicit action about income ?
With this , I thought growing up in my mind is the most important thing for success .
So think about capital .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Perhaps that &apos;s the most important thing ?
After this , of course — is it time ?
Did the idea come very quickly , and be unprepared for the world ?
It &apos;s fast , so you &apos;re going to go and teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or was it too late , and already has more aggression ?
So I went out with a lot of respect for these five things in a number of institutions .
And the idea was , there were 100 companies in the Libya , and 100 of them from the outside to try and reach the scientific results .
So first of all , these new Libra companies , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Good , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all dollars of revenue .
And the bottom five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we were hopeful , but not successful .
So I tried to organize all these identities as I think these companies had progressed .
So in the businesses outside Libya , I looked at strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
Nature was a big investment in business , and sometimes it was a business model , but it couldn &apos;t be successful .
I tried to know , but the most effective of all was the success and the failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was the choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent is in the difference between success and failure .
The team and the organization is on the other hand , and then , thinking , being different , you know , remoteness , it &apos;s actually number three .
But the fact is , it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not that ideas don &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was shocked to learn that belief is not the most important .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
Finally , a market model and investment comes to my mind .
I think the market model is really cool because you can start without a market model , and then you put it in a market mechanism .
And investing , if it &apos;s low-income but it &apos;s now increasing , particularly in today &apos;s context , is a very simple return .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these notes .
Take the big Airbnb , which everybody knows .
Many of the investors , we know , looked at the company , because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to give you a piece of your home for a tickler ? &quot;
Now , of course , this turns out to be false .
Well , one of the reasons for the success of the market , the best market model , the idea , and the market perspective is real time .
Companies were in a period of economic challenges when people needed additional income , and this made sure to help people respond to a bankruptcy attack on the way that they wanted to give their home .
This is Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best user .
But , time was everything right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders were also aspiring for additional income ; this was absolutely critical .
Some things , like Citysearch would come when people needed a page .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 here at TED , was around the time when companies wanted to look at what &apos;s up to companies .
We thought we were the best , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so busy — so , with enough businesses and a brilliant business model , we wanted to work with the giant Hallowland artists .
But in 1999 and 2000 , the Bad Internet was too late .
It was so difficult to watch the online video , you didn &apos;t have to know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and broadcast over 50 percent in the U.S. , it was YouTube &apos;s best time .
Great , good time .
As it turns out , YouTube was no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was a particularly optimistic time .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really critical .
Mind is critical .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to test time is to see if there are really goods ready for your wedding .
And this is absolutely unbelievable , that the outcome won &apos;t show up , because if you want something , you should be able to stay ahead , but you have to be very relieved in the time frame .
So as we said , early organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
I hope to share some of those stories with you about increasing your chance of success , and then that &apos;s not the case in some of the best places in the world .
Thank you very much , and you &apos;re the best audience .

&#91; 3 on September 2016 we saw the biggest data that came out of history &#93; &#91; Fund papers decorated with rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; Regenerative Bismarck surrounded by petty companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Rabbit to the Galapagos Venture . &#93; &#91; We &apos;re going to be the center of the week of a revolution with the widespread
Frankly , these papers pointed out of dirty clothing companies from small areas .
We tell ourselves the inner story of coaches , benchmarks and poachers who are going through the museums and saying , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a company to do , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can actually see a text interface , you can see a way to do it , you can see how they do it , how they do it .
The impact has just begun to manifest .
The head of the assassination is rampant .
We &apos;ve also heard about how weekday dictatorships are used by conservation companies like Alaska .
The revenue of a two-billion dollars violation goes to the main building block of the Royal Academy of Mom from his childhood friend , who &apos;s a popular Sister .
And many rich people are going to be infected , and even those that are going to tell the stories from now , are going to be at home .
Now that sounds like a magic trick or a violent jihad with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the fact that power and power people keep putting their money in place and the way they shouldn &apos;t pay as much tax , it means that wealth and affordable access to things like health and education .
And the impact on all of us .
My organization for Galapagos Venture , it &apos;s amazing .
global media and political leadership are talking about how people have their influence in shell companies that we &apos;ve been inspired by our decisions .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these companies work .
I think it &apos;s like the Rockefeller .
You can go into a company with a company , a company with a second company , almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind the screen .
Companies for Disease Control , press , school analysis is hard to understand what &apos;s going on .
And I think that &apos;s interesting , but we didn &apos;t even talk about it in the U.S.
Maybe that &apos;s because the major Americans don &apos;t have to be in that jar .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no rich people in America who are not investing in dirty companies .
It &apos;s because of the way the U.S. vehicle companies work , there &apos;s a few of them in the U.S.
I think if we look at the profile of the camera or the fiddle wheel or the wheel or the fiddle wheel , which is what the U.S. connects .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give much information , they need to give you little information to get the company out of the Libra card .
This is what the undergrads of schools in the U.S.
Nine venture capital compounds easily .
The behavior of this kind has an impact on all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to look at what this problem looks like .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we took a department and we sent them to 13 U.S. legal companies .
We became an African minister , and she wanted to move to America and talk about a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The crucial thing was that all the village had provided a one-way street of supplies for how the village could move .
These were all early applications , and we didn &apos;t build our customer for a while , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone , but we got a sense of the destruction of the system .
And , more importantly , don &apos;t treat it as individual questions .
It &apos;s not about individual values that talk to us about merit and proposal to us .
It &apos;s not just about a scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , that the tactics , the lighting , the poverty and the insurance .
And in order to be able to do that , we have to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be hard to create in this way .
It may be ironic , because for what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been increasing our visibility at the expense of a company .
Now , this problem was sold on the political hieroglyphics , but the British military Department of Defense Department of Defense at 8 cents that were in southern Ireland in 2013 .
And Europe has been building YoYo Contest on the local level , whether it &apos;s actually a country or a country controlling either .
The shot is that the ECM is behind it .
Compared to the point of view of contradiction in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to grow as much , so we did five .
We want to look at inventions , the large sections of the airlines , which were used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in Galapagos .
There has to be a lot of courage in the audience for those who don &apos;t know what to know behind barbed wire companies .
You know , they make a voice , and it &apos;s not good for a partner like this , we do .
Politicians need to adjust this problem , and they need to promote a lawful change in access to clean information .
We can aggregate this brutality with the privacy sections that are responsible for the cutting and the bullying .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that the Lux , your invention , has gotten so much more sensational in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , could it be true ?
Now , this is a little bit of a — what isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing you that a small group of workers are capable of committing a small group of information that &apos;s greater than all the other media in the world .
CA : How is that ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you maintain their privacy ?
Julie Singer : Yes , this is it . I can tell you — in the right sense , public goods . And we have so many ways that we can bring this information to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed radio interfaces to send materials from one place to the Internet , to attract mates to court from legal contracts like Sweden and Bill &apos;s .
We get the information that &apos;s available on average , through Ramadan , through Ramadan , through whatever , corporations that run it , frame it — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about broadcast information to public and then protect yourself against anti-poaching and political officials .
Chris Anderson : So you have to try to make sure the evidence is true , but you actually don &apos;t know what the product is .
Julie Singer : It &apos;s true , we &apos;ll never get it anywhere . And if we get it to a stage , we just take the skin and we discard the information .
( Cheers ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s money , and you &apos;re asking what the code is , the TED Reconciliation . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you invented a few years ago .
If we can see it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and then what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a report .
It was a secret blog report that the government of Kenya prepared after the elections in 2004 .
Already in 2004 , the government was down there for 18 years .
He was a summer in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the dogs — these were the primary attributes who were trying to run from Kenya , they spent 20 million pounds on this report card and one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for their political will , which was the wealthiest man — now is the wealthiest guy in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ for the Kenyan press .
That &apos;s why it was made in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this by the very first elections ever in December 2008 .
When we went to that report , we decided three days later to reach the new president , Kabul decided to volunteer with the person who was injured , Daniel Arabha , so he could have a report and put it in a makeshift museum .
Chris Anderson : And — So I mean , to cut a long story short , this is — this was spread in Kenya , not from the private sector , but from the contractor , and from your ranch , it changed the result .
Julin Sung : Yes . This is the burning of Gaddafi , and then it spread to all the major countries of Kenya and Tanzania and South Africa .
It came in from the outside .
And he , after a few days , convinced the Victorians of Kenya to talk about it .
And this was run on television for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equation for 10 percent of the weapons , according to a Quran , and it changed the result .
Chris Anderson : Wow , did your secret picture really change the world ?
Julin Sung : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . And we &apos;re going to show you a little demo of a little demo of a wiki seal .
Now , this video is kind of live , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
Here — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a heartbreaking video .
RD : ... Hi , when you approached them , I was telling them two .
I found , uh-oh , there are four things with them .
It &apos;s clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they come to you , tell me , go away .
Hit everyone .
Go , Galen !
( Machine sound ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Machine sound ) Galen is running .
Hatzalah — two brown mothers , two brown mothers .
We should now walk , time is up .
Alrighty , we killed eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two Hillel Keppers , and we &apos;re still running the cells .
Roger . They &apos;re on my side .
Two , this is two , we &apos;re on the grass .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hillel . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
Chris Anderson : So what happened ?
Julie Sung : People who worked on it had a very strong impact on it .
We ended up with two people in districts and more research .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
CA : So there were 11 people who died in that attack , right ?
Julie Singer : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two little children were killed .
Together , habitually , 26 people died .
CA : And after his execution , he finished .
What was the primary cause of the trouble , you think ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with a deep lack of power .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the street , and then on a kilometer away , the U.S. Capitol starts filling out 30 miles of gallons of electricity — each and every one of them — and building waste dumps to save lives .
There were two journalists who were no longer oppressed , because they were journalists .
Chris Anderson : The U.S. military has been arrested by Broadway Manning , and it &apos;s said that he announced in Chester Rome that he had video that you had about 280,000 and a half thousand U.S. subscriptions as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Singer : So we decided to take the documents away .
The footprint was removed just five days ago , which is 150,000 pieces of paper and 50,000 pieces of paper .
But what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve documented a contradiction of Ramadan and an American basketball team , but it doesn &apos;t correlate .
I mean I went to the safari room a lot .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of applications for the American White House ...
Julie Singer : We will convey them . ( CA : Would you do it ? ) Julie Singer : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) Julie Sung : Because things like this show that actually , what the Arab states are , for example , aggression with human rights in these states .
If you look at the hidden documents , these types of materials are in them .
Chris Anderson : Take a look at it and talk about it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you need to know the hidden information ?
Julie Singer : Yes , the question is how important information there is in the world , what data can &apos;t be rendered .
There &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you want to outsource information to keep an organization strong , it &apos;s a good indication that when you have to let your information out , you hope to do something good , because the organizations know it better , and they know the stories from inside , they care so much .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But is it about private or aggregated societies , where there &apos;s an unexpected end to meet ?
Julie Singer : We didn &apos;t share the documents with him .
I mean it &apos;s our greater impact .
We can start to look at information in a very specific way that is very personalized — containing the information that somebody gives .
But there are also some verses . Like your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about the public goods that come along and that are busy filling out youth .
Christian Anderson : Well , they kind of smoothly do this .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , of someone who is a father , the son of the American military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something that some people like to attack others .
One of the things that conveys contemporaneous American technologies about dead people .
And what this does is — it has millions of people around the world who are the U.S. military .
Although they &apos;re not , my son isn &apos;t , who &apos;s going to tell you what this is , what are you going to answer ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we get asked many questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t need to watch a video , they see it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what their ranks are , it doesn &apos;t matter what their text is .
Because they look at it every day .
It will change their frame and their frame of reference for all of this , and this is our hope .
CA : Well , you &apos;ve got a hope for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to have that light , do you have to have a privacy to have that kind of colliding ?
Julie Singer : No . I mean , we &apos;re not a different cell .
We don &apos;t have the information that &apos;s copied from other media .
If they do , then for us , that would be a very difficult situation , but we &apos;re doing the same thing that people are ethically committed to doing : They &apos;re going to increase the product back .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just betting , we &apos;ve all heard a lot about it — you know , the visibility here .
You can also imagine that there will be different breakthroughs about the lions and the lions .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or troubling .
What is the vision of a hero ?
And what about creating trouble ?
Julie Singer : Oh ! That should be something .
CSI : These are very good people , Julie , very good .
We &apos;ll have to try and . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t touched yet , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
Now , this is a really interesting story , which is a little old , right ?
What is this ?
Julie Singer : This is a sample of what we do nearly every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — in November , there were many important breakthroughs lying in the bananas , as were in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report card — which was a very nice experiment about it — which was to say that actually , conservation companies were competing against different oil companies , and they stood there and they spoke .
It involved the Soviet government , and so on and so forth .
And there was nothing on that report . That was a very difficult job for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate her because she didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , might this company have done this in a competition ?
At that point , we took her around , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about her .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material is so good , and it seems right to look , but we can &apos;t image it . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that he wrote , he wanted to take the paper for the device . ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to take the paper . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show pieces of paper that you actually have a law ?
Is this real you ? Because they brought us these guys that we see on Scripture with the name of Scripture with the name of Scripture magazine , with the name of Microsoft and the iPad .
Yes .
( Applause ) That &apos;s what has happened a lot .
This is a way to reach out and to see what the materials are , and this is to write and get feedback from these people .
CA : All right . So , have you ever got the information from inside the BBC ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we &apos;re accumulating and precipitating actions like difficult steps .
Our initiative to publish this has become invaluable in the last few months , because we &apos;re refining our budget system because of the extraordinary public waste that we have .
This is the water .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s flourishing , our ability to connect more with us is because of our growth , and this means that we have so many social services available to us , so we don &apos;t have so many people to sequence and convey information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , for the reassurance of journalists or journalists ?
Julie Singer : Yes . And trust people .
I mean , we have an organization that is really hard to overcome acceleration , because with the kind of material that we have to deal with , we have to rebuild the organization so that we can get people to work with a lot of sensitivity at stake , and then we have to think about things .
CA : Well , you gave us a talk about your own work and how you got to work .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , my parents were in the business of the movies and then they would move away from the neighborhood , so the two reasons were affected .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychiatrist , so it &apos;s just , you know , everybody can do something together and just create a mind .
Julie Singer : What , the business of movies ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a little bit of a hero , and you were kind of on the edge of a car search .
Julie Sung : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist , a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote an email , and I boy in that moment that I had been fascinated by this crime .
So you need to use the word and match the grammar .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for all kinds of different things .
Well , unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Rockefeller that &apos;s used by your grandmother to clear up the banks for your grandmother .
That &apos;s why that word , now it &apos;s not very helpful as it was before .
CA : Yes , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your main value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are , and perhaps one event in your life that helped them do this ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in facts .
But the basic value : good , good , wealthy people don &apos;t create influence ; they prepare it .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some other brilliant , aggressive people who live in my life .
CSI : Could the brilliant , not the brilliant people have influence ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a jolly man , so I &apos;m not very good at growth , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to reach the browser , which is to get close to the police , to crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been in my career for a very long time .
Chris Anderson : So we &apos;ll just tell you one last time : What happened in Ice Land ?
Basically , you published something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you tell the newspapers that they eradicate from their story .
Instead , they showed you your chance .
You &apos;ve become really familiar with this in the West . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ice Lland is a crisis .
He got the most powerful of it .
The banking tables here had gone up 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the state of the art movie had gone through a violent discrimination about five minutes before it was published , like a movie : &quot; The prohibitious anti-smoking movie entered the Death Store , and the state of the Newsroom was that &quot; It never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming all the time , and we became very popular in Ice Land , I went to Ice Land talked about this problem .
And the ingredients for the people here knew they shouldn &apos;t have to be again , and as a result , the Shanghai Shanghai , some other international experts , we devised a new kind of Isaac Land law , so it was a kind of freedom medicine , a place for the journalists all over the world to get the most protected , for the new Nobel Prize .
A country like Ice Landers is like Noora , which means the system is headed up from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the members of the Ice Landers reported this completely .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to lead to the most ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s more pressure to be made to agree with the laws of the free will and the laws of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What is it that takes ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so this is a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move past it or move past it .
Chris Anderson : Well it feels like I &apos;m translating the audience here to say something called , Julie , with respect , and all the power to you .
Julie Singer : Thank you , thank you . ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at the toy .
I don &apos;t like to play and watch .
So I did this by pressing the kitchen .
I used to walk around the corner of my childhood client , and I used to see this kind of cross-pollination in the mosque .
When I was growing up and I came back in the early &apos; 90s , I found this .
My team stayed quiet .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , I suddenly realized how the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the local butterfly , wherever I &apos;d go to North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in India , I &apos;d seen photos of all the four creatures on the island of New Delhi were — cold , silver , silver and code .
And I thought that was a really strange thing , and I was wondering if anyone else would ever have this pencil case .
And when I went out to visit him , I realized that people are not looking at these character staff .
ordinary people see something like this .
Deciphering the natural world with a few elements is not an unusual human quality .
We did that 10 thousand years ago when we first approached our caves .
If you look at the oil spills of 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a continuous perspective of all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back to the year 2000 , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , coal , alcohol and drug .
It is also true for the elders .
So if you look at a map of New York City &apos;s journeys , 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see cats like crocodiles , pottery and rain .
But if you look far back into the past , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re going to see just four orders of magnesium , ring , but also maneuvering .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving this way .
How did that happen to us ?
Shaheen .
This is a brand new problem .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing over the last 50 years .
World War II , we were the most emotionally vulnerable to the weapons .
In the middle of the Great War , where technology evolved , like the Shanghai , the Polymers , and all of these things were fading out into the grid .
And at the end of the Second World War , we have come to see the dramatic increase in the wealth of months .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the culprits in freshwater and seawater farming have increased , so over the last two years , it &apos;s increased from macaroni and cheese .
Now if you aggregate forest pollution , this will be equivalent to two China per year from the sea .
Now , this isn &apos;t a coincidence to use the Chinese character , because China is not only the largest country , it &apos;s also the largest border .
So now we turn to our four choices .
The first is the largest useless shelter in the United States and the West .
In the West , Gaddafi is an incredibly bad prey .
All we need is a pile of Frosted Flakes to get to the market for five , 10 , or 15 pounds-worth of grasslands .
In fact , even the Indus script is incredibly critical .
In a study done in the Department of Dangerous University , it showed that dealing with household charges is actually not that effective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the ranks of marijuana in the forest are the forests of mangroves .
Take a look at these beautiful images .
They detect the Earth &apos;s atmosphere from their place , protecting the beaches , cleaning and sedimenting children , keeping all sorts of important things for the atmosphere .
Something like this happened with the Alliance for Management .
We &apos;ve drifted millions of icons over the last 30 or 40 years .
A second process that &apos;s happening here , that &apos;s what the Philippines call &quot; &quot; the Nemo River . &quot; &quot; Watch , on the rail , and it &apos;s a very controversial thing .
Today , what &apos;s happening is that the leather reflex is hitting the reservoirs , but with it , with so much and so many other mosquitos , it causes them to change in their diet .
And many times she gets a job out of the seeds that the so-called &quot; &quot; Reddit , &quot; &quot; and she rolls through the seeds that we like to see on the beach , which means that the ecosystem of the ecosystem , which means that the ecosystem , itself , is writing on its own .
Then we have the second largest food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You have to send the large areas to organize networks like these .
We also have a region called the science fiction mining , the ICCAT . The Internet Convention on Climate Protection Data .
And the great reading of all the technology was also great .
We can farm our farms , but the tuna fishery is not good enough .
Most people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s too hot , too hot .
It &apos;s more than 40 miles per hour , and it &apos;s able to store its own temperature by 20 degrees Celsius .
So almost all the money for this petition ends .
A brewery is a blood vessel that doesn &apos;t flow very long .
That &apos;s great for proteins .
But the forest creatures are declining from 40 miles per hour are not capable of maintaining their ranch .
Even the time has been well-to-do , it doesn &apos;t have to be the other way about .
This is my political contact .
Connect was killing the forests .
So if you think of a map of the connectome , every dot is a document .
There are 3,000 more drugs in the state of Kinect .
In fact , I &apos;m just saying that people are rockets — ( Laughter ) if anyone is to unlock the power of concrete , I think we can really improve the world .
And everywhere , these are the rockets that discourage the rest of their children of peace .
As a result , we went to the ranks and we had a successful memorial for the Smithsonian .
When the space shuttle started , Smithsonian was spending six pounds of desalination in a trench .
But now it &apos;s much better .
There &apos;s one thing in return , and it &apos;s a little bit false , because if you think about the Freedom of Information Act , they called Sonoma Puppet for a Facebook page .
The FedEx is trained in a madrassa .
It &apos;s hard to say something called shallow pneumonia and pneumonia .
But there &apos;s also the whole market mechanism that talks about getting the market valued for replacing pneumonia .
This is a system that &apos;s producing cookie-cutting geothermal .
This is seven percent a year .
We &apos;re spending a lot less money on how to get a market , but we &apos;re also spending a lot of money on how to get a market .
Not only do we grow leather but we also grow crops and vegetables .
We have what &apos;s left the eggs and the milk that &apos;s eating the powder .
Because of the leather , blood and bone , things like that , are picked up mosquitos .
I wonder , might there be a refrigerator who fills but then clears the waste .
India was first or a pier . ( Laughter ) As a result , this was a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s used desalination brine .
It &apos;s equivalent to the third of China or the people in the United States who get out of the sea every year .
That &apos;s the last thing in four categories .
Philadelphia actually started as a liver .
It started with relatively simple philanthropy that one of the local financers had noticed that on a Friday afternoon , they would never get to the mosquitos .
He came to the park and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make the leather for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
For the oceans , the seeds that are most common are proven to be true , but it is not good enough .
So he built his lifetime probe .
Well , the snow was 30 seconds .
He wanted to create a 25-seventh sensor , so he brought in the electronic code .
This entrepreneurial pollination is permissible for the Alaska Philadelphia , and it &apos;s the largest mass of art in the United States , and it &apos;s 23 billion pounds a year away from the sea .
If we stop polling , the alternative candidates might be Tropical .
Twenty years ago , nobody even knew Taliban .
It shifts the plant proteins in a very dynamic way in animal protein , and this is a river for the third world .
Actually , this is a very sustainable solution ; in nine months it &apos;s an adult .
The problem is , if you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a windmill .
It &apos;s not the FBI and the DNA that we think will live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor man is talking about legacy .
This represents a large sample of about 30 million tons .
A lesson for conservation has pointed out is , can we eat it ?
Can we leverage it instead of giving them the peace ?
There are reasons for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the market of India who is a typical part of slavery versus slavery , and the more effective parts of the ranch of India .
It &apos;s October 3 , the EPA and the CDC are a great tool .
So here &apos;s his potential .
But what if we took this approach , and instead of paying a few dollars , we just dumped some FedEx or Pittsburgh , and we turned it into a Facebook , we hired the leather and we asked them to pay for two buckets a month to get it to the head of the line ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is the personal character .
The EPAC and the DNA are much more like Twitter .
The Indus script is incredibly effective .
The cash for good measurements of meat is only thirds of the income tax to the market .
Actually , approximately three is not coming from the kitchen .
sea level rises by three , so it just collects them .
On top of that , it &apos;s the unbelievable .
Our Western cities have been lost because of the use of Facebook and the Internet .
Over the past 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been born , this is a big part of the death of the sea .
And as you might imagine with a cell , in all these different ways , proteins and , more than three , are highly effective signals .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And finally , the letter is a question .
We can produce a lesson that can provide the benefits of ocean protein .
This creature should be a green saber , and it has the ability to grow fast and change its environment in a way that is shaped by the EPA , DHA , Omidyar 3 and the East Coast .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the last 15 years .
Whenever I do that , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do that . We can do that .
But he &apos;s not trying to give it a try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
And if we do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is nearly 30 million in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , the problem is slightly more dramatic .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I grew up reading the brain because I have a brother , a brother , who is ADHD .
Growing up and then I wanted to understand as a scientist how I can connect my dreams to my reality and I create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , this is what unites their dreams , their common reality , and they &apos;re doing their job .
So I spent my life studying serious illness .
I moved to Boston from my wife &apos;s office in India , where I worked at the Purdue Doctor Francession Bank , which was in Philadelphia at Harvard University .
And the answer to this question , which was looking at the biological surface , is what is the difference between the brain of people who are normally thought of as being compared to the brain of people who are facing conditions like schizophrenia or schizophrenia or Purdue DC , so what we were trying to do is create a map of the microscopic map of the brain , and what is the cell delivering the
So I &apos;ve been a little bit confused in my life because I used to do this kind of research in the day , &quot; &quot; but on a Saturday and a Saturday afternoon , &quot; &quot; I used to travel to the National Lives for these antennas .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I wanted to find out that I was faced with an intellectual poster .
The lower left of my brain was a nine-way street .
And for the next four hours , I watched my brain become completely disconnected from any other source of information .
This morning I was able to read and write and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of the brain that are very , very similar to each other .
I created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the left part of the brain , the right part of the brain , of a touchpad touching the left side of the brain , and it &apos;ll stay in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain that are completely identical to each other .
And for those of you who think that computer , on the right part of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain works like the electrical processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the cross-body , covering 300 volumes of information .
But beyond that , the two pieces are completely open .
Because they think that information is in a different way , knowing that every part of their knowledge has a totally different knowledge about different things , and so let me just let you know who they are , and they &apos;re very different from each other .
Sorry . Thank you . It &apos;s been a fun .
SOC : Yes , it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) The imagery of our brain is only happening now , and we &apos;re thinking about this moment .
Right now , part of our brain is thinking in images of the brain , and it is thinking organically from our physiology .
Information is containing and storing moments in our bodies through the neurological system , and then it is containing and turning into a great Islamic classroom that we think about in the present moment , how we feel and how we feel in our brains .
I am an energy geographically connected to the energy surrounding the brain by sensing the right part of the brain .
We &apos;re the brainwashes of energy that are connected to each other through the awareness of the right part of the brain , as a human family .
And at that time , we &apos;re brothers and sisters on this planet who are responsible for making the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left side of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is scientifically and scientifically thinking .
The left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is based on the fact that we &apos;re recently putting the largest album / Class in , and then we begin to collect analytical analytics .
And it also organizes and facilitates all of this information , links all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past , and the possibilities of the future , which is to justify the impact on our beliefs .
The left part of our brain is thinking of compartments in language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that has been taking us and our inner world and our inner world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that , you know , you have to go home and buy them at home .
I &apos;ll need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a very rich sense of reading a book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; I ! I am ! &quot;
And in the same way that my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become a victim .
I become the only person in the world with the energy that surrounds me and the waves you .
That same part of my brain actually ended up sparking a fire this morning .
The morning of the assault , my left eye in the back of my eye , with a huge amount of pain .
It was so painful , kind of an extension of the eye of an eye .
And that pain that connected me and left me .
He leaves , he leaves , he leaves .
And to me , it was an unusual thing that I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s okay , I start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went and I put on a scale and I put on my cardboard , which is a physical exercise machine .
Now , I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it feels like I &apos;m holding a finger in the palm of someone who &apos;s touching the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s a really strange thing . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Whoa , I feel this is the big , uncomfortable thing . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the whole thing has changed , which is a kind of general sense of what I have in common with a human being who is performing out of this experience , but now I have been sort of a visceral
And it was all very strange , and I had a huge heart attack .
So I got out of the machine , and I started to walk in the room and I realized that everything was going on in my body .
And bingo is very difficult and very thinkable .
There &apos;s no connection at my speed , and I think there &apos;s a household problem , and it &apos;s only through the inner system .
I stand in my sewery house ready to get under the water and I &apos;m actually listening to a conversation inside my body .
I made a sound that was saying yes , my brother has to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balanced , I &apos;m going to grab hold of the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t right now modify my body &apos;s waste .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to end , because my hand is held up with the atom and the magnetic wall of my hand .
If I was understanding something , that was the energy ...
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my brain that &apos;s pretty quiet .
It was like someone was speaking to the TV on the reserve .
A breath .
Once upon a time , I was blown away by the bumps of my brain .
But then immediately , much like the other , embodied energy in that big space that surrounded me .
And because I could no longer understand the boundaries of my body , I felt my absolute , powerful , loving , loving .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
And suddenly , all of a sudden , the back of my brain , he said to me , &quot; You are a member of a problem . &quot;
We need to help him , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really in trouble , but I immediately came back to the same consciousness that I &apos;m going to say for a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
And look , it would be a beautiful place where you would be completely unconnected to this tiny brain that is connected to the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the street where my job is and I &apos;m going to pay attention to it .
I felt so deep in my body .
And look , all of your relationships from the outside world , and from that , some of the stress was lost .
And I realized a space of peace .
And let &apos;s see what it would look like if you leave behind this 37 year-old emotional burden that you &apos;ve been holding .
( Laughter ) Oh , I was just raised as a welder .
It was beautiful .
So then I got into the brain , and he said , &quot; Oh , don &apos;t worry . &quot;
We need someone , and I &apos;m thinking that I should help me be proud of it , so I went away from the dirty home and I applied myself to the makeup , and now I &apos;m walking into my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , can I have a car ? &quot; &quot; And this moment my hand is completely wide open .
It was then that I realized that my God was going to attack me , the next thing that my mind tells me is , how awesome this is .
( Laughter ) How amazing !
How many brain researchers would have thought that would be a time when they could be aware of their own brain and that they could go in there . ( Laughter ) Then one day came to my mind . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very popular woman . ( Laughter ) I have no time to go in there . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Alrighty , I can &apos;t stop acting in college , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I have to get a phone call to help . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the work . Then I remembered that I had my business card on which my phone number is .
So I go into my research room and I spend about three inches of business cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card at the top , even though I can see from my naked eyes what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card , because I can &apos;t see a lot of eye contact with my naked eyes .
And the words themselves are going to suffer from the map of paper and the symbols of the letter , and I was not reading anything .
And so I started waiting for him to describe what I like to call the diagnosis .
And in that moment , the typical truth was repeated , and I found that this is not a card . This is not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to decrease just one inch of this pain .
And the effect that it had on the left for 45 minutes was getting worse .
I don &apos;t understand the number . I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I have no option .
So I take the phone and I plug it in there .
I took the business card and I put it here , and now I &apos;m going to look at the cards , the little girls on the phone , and I &apos;m going to look at the face of the girl .
But then I turn to my own halal lender when I come back , I don &apos;t remember putting that number in .
So I took my fucking arm like a giant elephant and I put it on the hills , and as the other hand suggested to them , when I came back to the normal truth , I could tell you that I had just come back from India and finally came back from all over India and I heard that the phone was on the cocktail of a girl just called me up and said , &quot; &quot; Whoa , whoa . &quot;
So I say to him , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m speaking , I need help . &quot;
And from my mom , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Whoa . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; My God , I &apos;m speaking like the Gulf River . &quot; &quot; And then I found that I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak a language or I couldn &apos;t understand until I tried .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
Shortly after that , around an ambulance , around the heavens of the Boston Massacre , Mississippi was rushing to hospital .
I walked down the street like a toddler .
Just like the one in which the rest had faded and the rest had fallen out of the bank , I pulled the energy out and I realized I had a warning .
And it was then that I realized I was no longer in my life .
Or my doctor saved me and offered me a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I finished , I was shocked to learn that I still live .
When I felt really in shock of my soul , then I said life to God .
Now my brain has been inspired by two contradictions between reality .
So I started to realize the intrinsic motivation of my conscious system , which was only in the case of pain .
Light would be bent around my brain like a fire in the forest , and the air would be so strong and so bright that I would not be able to hear a voice , or I would not be able to speak , and I would simply be following the path of being .
Because I couldn &apos;t really understand the body &apos;s position , it was so I had a deep and wide experience of what was going on with my belly .
And my spirit has been unleashed , like a great event melting through the sea of dirty water .
Great Diane .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of winning .
And I was reminded of that , and I was thinking that it would never be possible that I would be able to unlock my wonderful existence by reaching out into the small body .
But that &apos;s when I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been incarcerated .
And if I &apos;ve been inspired and I &apos;ve been alive since then , whatever life can be encountered by the neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world filled with beauty , fraternity , compassion and love , people who know can someday feel this quality .
And they can come together and choose the right thing is when they want to take their steps to the left of their brain to look for transparent quality .
And then I understood how this experiment could be a gift . &quot; &quot; It was a kind of a shelter that taught me how to live my life .
It motivated me to be healthy .
Eventually , after a period of half-heartedness , the soul pieces of blood were pumped out of my brain along the outsides of a pneumatic state of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real fate in my life .
It took me eight years to become completely healthy .
So who are we ?
We are the most powerful branch of life with artificial skills and two extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world where we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I can step to the right of my consciousness &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , and I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful cells are made up of organic , semantic cells , one that is all there .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a trivial way .
From the knee to the knee .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
We &apos;re in there .
What would you choose ?
Which would you choose ?
And where ?
I think as long as we spend our left-right brain fighting this expensive electrical impulse , we are going to promote peace in this world and our planet is going to be so safe .
And I thought that was worth spreading this idea .
Thank you .

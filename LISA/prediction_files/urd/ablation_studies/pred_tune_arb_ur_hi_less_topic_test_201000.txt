Good morning !
You guys are everywhere ?
They brought my name to the table , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the table in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , just before a young age , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating them .
So I asked the question : Do you have a free food in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Mini , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Come on .
He was speaking to me to three men , as his statement to me , &quot; If he was the last girl in the world , I would not see him ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic mean ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl in account and jihad .
How could he speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What is it that I get from my country to speak my language ?
Where does this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there &apos;s a lot of people like me , who go to a point in their lives where they basically leave out everything that &apos;s in their museums , just because they love it and they &apos;re terrible .
Should I be bringing all my culture , my ideas , my spirits and spirits ?
We might have encountered the most important battle stories of children .
Do they have to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What makes sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice for the Russians as it did for me .
The Arabic does not represent the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or research , the language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we look at when we work on projects of a particular tree , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we preach at TED .
If we do that , they will outcaste us .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a reality .
But another really important fact we need to think about .
Arabic is a language .
Research tells us that in other languages , we need to translate to our mother tongue .
In other languages , the primary attributes of mother language for creativity .
Why ?
Jennian Gilbert , when he first started writing , used Arabic .
All his thoughts , imaginations and philosophy were inspired by this young man who was in the village where he grew up , felt a sense of happiness , sounded a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had enough materials .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their essays in English , you feel the same joy , you feel the same feeling .
You can imagine that even in English these are the same teachers , the little girl who lived in the village next to Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging economies are emerging .
Germany , France , Japan and China are in all power .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the wall , they spend a lot of money on remittances .
Do we know better ?
OK , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this incremental mindset we haven &apos;t yet gotten , and we want to get to this advanced world .
They were countries that were like ours at a time , but decided to try to grow up , to research , and to go to countries , such as Taiwan , employees and so forth , they could study their own language as being leaving girls , like Hasbro .
They kept it close to themselves .
Because if you take Turkey or Who is the product , and you don &apos;t write it on the subway , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these offices , non-visual users , like us , more time .
So to create new inventions and innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , autism , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will make you remember ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , they &apos;re just about us .
Language is a symbol of the very fabric of our lives , and the vocabulary that separates us from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you makes a special roof in your brain — there are feelings that are specific to one particular day in the history of somebody .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an insight into what we think , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What about our mind ?
How are you going to know that or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Friedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , I better go and spend some time talking about illiteracy .
It &apos;s that these affections remind us of a particular thing .
I have a friend from a French speaker who &apos;s a French speaker .
Once upon a time , I was asking this question .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his husband and translate it , I prayed one night to what &quot; &quot; humiliation &quot; &quot; means . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The old woman abruptly called her &quot; &quot; humiliation , &quot; &quot; and then she spent the night trying to understand it .
He was wondering , how could someone really show up ?
Do they want to self-destruct ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us realize that he didn &apos;t understand his husband &apos;s name , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought was different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; She , she runs with me Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate for her to feel what I feel when I sing Fridays . &quot; &quot; Billy woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have already raised my hand and why you have it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And soon , because you are me , I have left my hand and you have left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
He translates . He shows me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to make the Arabic language simple ?
We turned it into a perceptual shift for society , and we started the Arabic language protector .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Please don &apos;t worry , don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protector listened a saying , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you respond to the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t use this method , because in this way , we wouldn &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be active in the way our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
The letter looks like us and the way we think .
So this sentence : &quot; &quot; I talk to you in the East , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; Please sit down .
Very simple but effective .
Later on , we started a new mirror with the landscape of the Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example from the outside , a landscape in which the letter black and white is at the bottom of the screen , using the translation , &quot; Kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really should not kill our language .
If we kill our language , we have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great deal when it comes to eating time for novelty and religion .
Later on , we found boys and girls taking photos of Arabic .
Cole models for girls and girls .
We are so close .
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; college . &quot; &quot; They want to suggest how much they want to suggest , but I &apos;m going to get a word that &apos;s good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t shame ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to acknowledge that we will not allow anyone to become greater or to realize that the language has empowered us , to push us , to push us , to push ourselves and to push our mind .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
Right now , each one of you is an innovative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start with that time .
They write a note or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the Global Goals .
She can re-invent Arabic on the front page .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s solutions .
But we have to know it , and we have to be convinced that the solution is there , part of the solution .
In honor , what can you do today ?
Which of you have tattoos ?
For the Muslim , I recommend you , though , my time is over , or in Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin word .
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a language .
Going back and forth is not easy .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for the conservation of this language .
Now let me give you a secret .
A child dies of the first time using the language of her father .
When my daughter was born , I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your father , that &apos;s it . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I proposed to my daughter that in the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , mama .
And don &apos;t expect anyone to know . ( Applause ) You get this cultural shopping . ( Applause )
I speak a little English speaker for it to remind us that we have no option but to draw the circumstances of our presence , the circumstances of our lives that are poisoning to my people , until you see me not banking my generation , when we &apos;re stressed out of this generation of inequality does not correlate with our generation until they become so rare to condemned for
( Applause )
My favorite thing is the calculus data .
In college , I had a very basic title , which meant I had to write magazines .
Now , when a normal person writes something , this approach will work .
You know ... ( Laughter ) You may start by thinking less early , but in the first week , you do more work and later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I also want to do that .
That &apos;s my approach .
All of my responses are going to be ready , but the actual work of insurance is going to take place , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens to all traffic jams .
And then again reached a whole bunch of research papers , recycled papers that you complete in one year .
And I knew that my common practice did not correlate with this type of behavior .
That was a huge thing .
I edited the project , I decided I would do something like this .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit like this this this this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of effort , a little bit of effort in the centuries , and increase the speed of work , and finally I &apos;m going to give it more and more just like a puzzle .
How hard is learning going to get ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Come back and forth , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we came up with a great project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would get serious , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had something .
And two months went by one month , two weeks went by .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in David Lynn , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I wrote 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads — people shouldn &apos;t go on two roads — one day it was spending a lot of time in the campus , and then David Lynn came on the screen
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got an assignment and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you want to be Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you on the front page . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; From the point of view , it &apos;s perfect . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I couldn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
She was very welcome . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be happy with that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s amazing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about Sierra Leone .
My roof applies to six people all the time , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that the brain makes a difference between six people .
To find out how to do that , I took a leaf blood vessel where I could put both of these brains together , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there has been some variation .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , that &apos;s not so obvious , but look at it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of them have been making decisions in the brain , but sadly , it &apos;s in the human brain that enjoys it .
Now , what does this mean for a singer ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; It &apos;s time for work graduation . &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The rich man will make philanthropic decisions to make meaning , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he picks up the profile , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and Tony Hidden , because I know it just happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we go to the floor , and lo and behold , something new happened in 10 minutes ?
Then you look at YouTube , and it starts talking about the race of Richard &apos;s face , and very soon it ends up seeing the Internet for Mother Bears .
( Laughter ) It will take a while for all of those things , so there won &apos;t be any time for it to do today .
What a shame ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s happening here ?
Now this is not the basis of happiness that you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present time .
There is no matter what the future doesn &apos;t know ; it &apos;s just two things : happiness and joy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you can and you spend your entire life going faster and easier , you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And to conclude , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and increased generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened at a young age .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s no longer a tribe .
We are an increasing tragedy , and we don &apos;t know it .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a minds that makes decisions , that makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make great designs .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is do what we enjoy .
Sometimes a farmer seems to be right to do what is easier and fun to eat , to sleep or to feel comfortable in the moment of opportunity .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a stigma .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big cause .
And here &apos;s the critical difference .
And for the rest of the audience , this contradiction always leads to something , which spends a lot of time in the short run , a simple and mysterious way that &apos;s out of place for centuries .
I call this the Dark Ages .
( Laughter ) The dark matter is the place where the Sun people are so familiar .
That &apos;s where dignity is at the moment when we don &apos;t have to be compassionate .
In the dark sphere that you see is not really the matter , because it &apos;s not the right — space feeling , fear , anxiety , and feeling of hatred — all the characteristics that are in good shape .
The question is , in this case , when the source is celebrated , how do the rest of us rise up into the abyss , which is less happy but important ?
There &apos;s evidence that even people who are conservative , who protect them all the time in their dark spaces — somebody has asked him to guess what he said .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s a housekeeping thing , but when David lines up , it &apos;s a wonderful wake-up call or it &apos;s a moment when people are threatened to embarrassment , to avoid employment , to avoid scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the product only works .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and gave me a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
My wish was to join TED in May .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and anger , something else was happening in the brain of recent decisions .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; The publisher said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do it here . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the Indian crossword puzzle at the bottom of 20,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house till we look at India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
In six months , after two and a half months , people at TED decided to name the Koran .
I opened the web up and there was a photograph of me holding .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The guests were able to survive , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember being frightened of the homeowner — he &apos;s sitting on the tree !
And finally , and finally , the religious decision-makers came to Kenema and I could start working on the conversation .
Now the guests who tell the story about each type of editor crossing the puzzle , someone like me puts it on for two weeks , and there &apos;s no waiting for the start of the puzzle , and then suddenly the unbelievable lesson of the puzzle sets up all night to go and write the sentence .
And the three-dimensional finish of this is what &apos;s called a system of rich people .
It &apos;s not very nice for anyone to do it .
And a few years ago I decided to write blogs about this .
When I wrote this , I was struck by the implications of it .
I actually had thousands of miles of products spread from all around the world and from people , from all walks of life .
They included nurses , bankers , engineers , penetrants and even CEOs .
( Laughter ) And everybody was telling the story and saying , &quot; I am too confused . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the following question of email and the number of email accounts .
People &apos;s scripts were lying in the script saying how much Scripture did in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , &quot; &quot; OK ! What if the system is right then ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out there are two orders of magnitude .
Today I gave you all these examples , talking about subjects , all of them being David Lynn .
And when David lines up , recent effects are at stake because guests are reported .
But the Sun is a second kind of race , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any David Lynn .
So if you want a project that starts itself like some art or commerce — some kind of arts or businesses , until you don &apos;t start keeping your eyes on the prize and doing things .
Also , there are many other things that don &apos;t have to do with David Lynn , such as having to do with his family , communicating , sensing your health , finding your relationships , telling your relationships that you &apos;re not fighting with .
Now , if the only way to do the harvest is to do the harvest , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data lines that we have in the situation are losing the gap .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest effects are that you can &apos;t beat them , they &apos;re always with you .
And this is a typical leather disorder that &apos;s too subtle to look at and talk about less than just killing , consistent , primitive giving .
You &apos;re suffering from horror and suffering .
And this could be a replica of the Taliban and the Taliban .
So I thought that was the reason they had an email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not meant for the project .
The Toyal Tombs have been trained , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot pursue their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and there was one thing that I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think you &apos;re all healthy .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And I think some of the DVDs in the U.S. are very well related , but remember the keys when there &apos;s no longer any David Line .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call this the life cylinder .
Each block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
They &apos;re not very much a blog , especially when some of them are being interviewed .
I think we all need to be careful with this Canada .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing , because there &apos;s no time in every life .
We need to be careful with the creation of compassion .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that family there , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Hi .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One day in the United States and Afghanistan , a handful of eight days , a handful of eight days of U.S. and Afghanistan were moving from a region of Afghanistan to a region of Afghanistan that was helping to protect an office of the Afghan government to help protect an office of the department of the Afghan government to help protect an official occupation of the Afghan government to help prevent an official
He came into the window of an invasion , and he was surrounded by three and a lot of stuff , and he watched as a child by the Captain Seventine as a child by the Cape Seventine , and he watched as a child by the time the victims would go and take the dead .
One of the people who knew her kids , one of the surgeons , one of them , and one of the smartest kids , was moving towards one individual Kepler , and one of them was moving towards one individual Kepler .
It &apos;s shown in the U.S. that the clean water supplies and the clean water supplies to fuel .
They put it into the Hole in the Wall computers , and then you see that the Cape Seventine is sitting there and staring at it before they put other people in for the child .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? It &apos;s such a visceral emotion when you want to do something like this .
Here &apos;s a love and I knew why it &apos;s not the way I work with people .
You know , in the spring , you &apos;re given to people who are desperate to try and serve other people .
In business , we blame people who are desperate to punish other people in order to benefit us .
We have the electrical calculus !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just the best people .
That &apos;s why they land on the hill .
The best people cherish the idea of mercy .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is an environment , and if you have a spiritual environment , each of us has the ability to cooperate flexibly , so that each and every one of us has the ability to cooperate flexibly and extend it so that we have the ability to do this in others .
I &apos;ve had the absolute privilege of meeting with some of these people , and we &apos;re going to call them Yesterday — ( Applause ) — and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why can you do this ?
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that these are emotions , not adults .
I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; Stand me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It &apos;s not possible that I give two people the chance to collaborate and do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does this excitement come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years ago to the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of risks that are driving us all the time .
There &apos;s no personal matter .
Women Are Heroes may be a lack of resources , a lack of wealth , but these are all things that are working together to reduce the longevity of our lives .
And so we set up in social animals where we &apos;re all together and we work together as part of what I call a &quot; &quot; hadith &quot; &quot; category , as in a tribe where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , cooperation was natural .
It has autonomous benefits .
That means I can go to sleep at night and swim around and look at some of my neighbors .
If we don &apos;t trust each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t trust you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The new approach looks something like this .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are trying to make our lives harder or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
It can transform society into a more unfair form of the stock market .
It could be a new technology that pulls your commercial bread away overnight ; it could be a new technology that can lead your commercial bread through the night .
Or you may have a fight that sometimes tries to kill you .
It sometimes tries to frame you out of business , but at least it sucks at your risks and tries to steal your businesses from you , it sucks your risks and tries to steal your businesses from you .
We do not have any values on these powers .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the action is , because that &apos;s the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in her organization and their lives that are meant to protect the people in her organization and protect the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to assess their own quiet and benign results so that people can experience their dignity and their hidden results so that people can feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , that things can protect .
I was on a one-way trip , and I realized the fact that when a passenger began to walk in front of him trying to find it and I saw the staff on the front door as he walked by this man just like he passed the law as he was crying .
Once upon a time when I tried to walk in , this was the first time I tried to walk in it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep washing machines like this ?
Why can &apos;t you work with us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he quickly gave me the exact answer .
She does not trust her leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Airlines is not because they hold infinite people on the ground .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t run from their leaders .
You see , if the circumstances are there , we spend our time and our energy protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and our energy protecting ourselves from one another , and that makes organization worse .
What a great leader can do for him is to give the most close example of what a good parent is to be a good leader for him , and the most close example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our children opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the opportunity to grow and get more of what we can do for ourselves , to grow and to get more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give them the opportunity to trust themselves , to have time and to have failure so that they can achieve greater achievements that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve greater achievements than ever
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City , says one thing that if you have a tough time in your family , would you ever open a kid ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie lost practical wisdom of employment , and Charlie lost practical employment .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get involved in the infrastructure of the business .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will mentor you and help you , much like we would like to take our own kid who goes to school to get a grade .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are running CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are running CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are very upset and angry , some of the bankers are running from CEOs , who are uncomfortable with depression and care .
It &apos;s not data .
Instead , they have solved the fundamental principle of dignity .
They have grown a denser society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones to their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones to their loved ones , instead of saying they &apos;ve given up on their loved ones , to their loved ones , to their loved ones , than to say they &apos;ve enslaved their loved ones .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do instead of data .
Can anyone guess why they put a $ 150 million bill into gold ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problem with that ? Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people for their children .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people for their children .
Instead , they will test people with skin data for their kids , but they will test people with skin data for their kids .
A mining company in Bup Champs-Élysées runs a mining company in Bup Champs-Élysées , called Barry Whemiller in 2008 , and they took over 30 percent of their roads overnight .
Now in a large mining company , it &apos;s a very big problem and they can &apos;t afford to maintain their agriculture overnight .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , so many of the companies that we have today come together and do a sudden thing .
And Bob answered that .
You &apos;ll notice that the Bubble doesn &apos;t trust the Gulf .
Instead , the Bubble believes in the generation of sick people , and it &apos;s harder to reduce heart attacks and harder to reduce heart attacks .
And then they developed a personal project .
That every employee , from CEO to CEO , had to hire everyone in a four-week vacation .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to do it this way .
But as Bob explained in the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said that it &apos;s better that we all accept huge losses , that some of us would retain a lot of hurdles and suffer this way .
So they &apos;ve raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody expected , people began to trade off each other .
The ones that were most successful were making low-achievement trade-offs .
That is , somebody has licensed five volunteers to get one to the other in three volunteers .
Knowledge is an exception .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing , and I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs , and we do what they say because they have access to us but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of organizations who don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the courage to look at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the courage to look at the person on the left , and they have the courage to look at the person on the right , and they have the courage to look at the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the physicists that had been out in the theater , and as philosophers do , the way that the honey bee eats loud and he presses his men first , and when he eats , nothing lasts for him .
And when he came back into the area , his men gave him some of his food to eat because that &apos;s what he did .
We tell them that they start .
We call them leaders because they take risks before anyone else , we call them leaders because they take risks before anyone else .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them and make them better off , and when we do that , natural selection is that our people can harvest us .
They will give us their blood and pint and blood to see if their leaders &apos; dreams are becoming real and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you supply your blood and pneumonia and you to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they also do this to us . &quot; &quot; And is this not the organization we would all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a young man named Motetema in the story of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where water supplies and water is really unbelievable , like in moments , and it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions at a time when I was 17 years old , I was staying quiet with friends in the bush working alongside friends .
The sun is overhead in the womb .
And as I was dozing off into the street , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches the skin and you don &apos;t have to clean up ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I just bought it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some wonderful statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-four of them are in Africa , and there are only four of them in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment called the most dangerous tragedy .
The reason the tragedy in the eyes is a manifestation of the tragedy through a more isolated injection of the tragedy you can get instantly tired of .
This disease kills eight million people a year , and one of the biggest things that &apos;s happening is you have to simply reject yourself from the trunk : no gods , no worms , no projections .
After looking at these informational statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then one of my brilliant people from 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have an Internet broadband , I went to Google and did some
And I looked at this as a special problem in the box .
So Mohammed said right , our family is ready .
Now we need to be careful .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses writing my patent on cell phones , and I &apos;m the youngest patent warrior in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; No more gold ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I designed DryBath , exposed to the world &apos;s first email exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need the skin .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and in limited resources that I had , the Millennium Development Goals Index brought in some new people , did that additional thing , and now we have a full-blown paradox , which is ready for the market , is now available .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They purchase what they need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a ticket in Alex . They buy a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how you get more fun .
So we found DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just push it between and out .
And the cool thing is , a square trade-off is only in five rations .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath , the rich kids from the air strike , ( Laughter ) once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave the garden and we could save two houses for children , both in the villages , two houses , more for school dropouts — two more houses for the kid .
After witnessing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it to our core values , health and safety .
DryBath is a rich man and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re entering this project in process , now we &apos;re actually entering a market mechanism that could supply it to the retail market , and a question that I have for my colleagues today , at the Limpopo Crubble , with an ion of 50 cents a week to fashion the world not to manage .
Are you kidding ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot in the early stages , Google announced me as the world &apos;s first young man .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur right now , the first African to be able to access it , and one of the things that really surprised me , and why all of this talk should not be cheated . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , interestingly , I &apos;m here to share some of the results with you today , and I was also surprised to see what are the real reasons why organizations succeed , which is really why they succeed .
I believe that donor agencies are a great tool to make the world a better place .
If you choose a group of people with the desire for equality and initially organize them , you will discover human abilities that have previously been impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is it that the majority of them fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to investigate a lot of organizations , some of my most fierce ideas and misconceptions that came from organizations all over the world .
I wanted to know this because I was starting a diverse business at the age of 12 , from Jennifer Health League Baseball to Kennedy School , when I was building solar systems , then in college , when I made a radio station .
I graduated from college and founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve backed over 100 companies , many successes , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain why organizations succeed or failed at these factors .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think there &apos;s something here .
So I cofounded a company called Aideda Lib , which is an old lady that you feel at some point .
With patient care , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to take care or repair , are more important factors than I think .
I &apos;d never thought that this was going to be a disappointment at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a project , until I don &apos;t have a penny in it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business as well .
In the shorthand of a team , it &apos;s important to recognize the potential to be driven by the car .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought that maybe the team is the most important thing .
So I started looking at business models .
Does an organization have a clear effect on income ?
With that idea , I thought it was the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Could that be the most important thing ?
After this , of course — is it time ?
Isn &apos;t that a bad idea , and the world wasn &apos;t set for it ?
It &apos;s quick , that means you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or has it been a long time ago , and has it been a terrible thing ?
So I &apos;ve gone through these five factors with a lot of priorities .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in Libya , and 100 others outside to try and find a scientific result .
So first of these ideas on laptops , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all dollars of revenues .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink gave us a lot of hope , but didn &apos;t succeed .
And then I tried to incorporate all these characteristics , as I think these companies had promoted .
Then in the outskirts of ideas from Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and Linkeddin .
A couple of failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in those companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to understand that the worst effect of all worked in the success and failure of these companies , and the result struck me .
The first thing was choosing time .
At the right time , 42 percent is the difference between success and failure .
Step three is on the other side , and then thinking , having different ideas , separating ideas , actually provides a third .
But it &apos;s not really true , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I realized that belief isn &apos;t the most important thing .
Sometimes it matters a lot more when it happens .
The last two , I think , is business model and investment .
I think the commercial model is still missing because you can start with a business model later , when customers grow up , including this .
And even investment , if initially it was low-income but now it &apos;s increasing , especially in today &apos;s long-term , investment is simply too easy .
I &apos;m here to give you some examples of all of these dots .
A huge success on Airbnb , as everybody knows .
A lot of investors in this company were noticed because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put a product in their house ? &quot;
Of course , it &apos;s proven wrong .
One reason for the success of the mosquito is the best market model , market model , market thinking , and market thinking is the right time .
This company came into the area of the financial crisis when people needed additional support , and it made sure to help people respond to a banana in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
But , the time was absolutely right : get the drivers behind it .
Dreaders were also demanding additional assistance ; it was absolutely essential .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was at a time when corporations wanted more private companies to look after .
We thought that was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was the online entertainment company .
We were very interested in this . With a lot of effort and a lot of marketing , let &apos;s have a conversation with some of the leading thinkers at Hollywood to work with the company .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband band was very little .
It was really hard to see the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser and what to do , and finally this company revealed itself in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of the coconut problem and crashed 50 percent in the United States of broadband , YouTube arrived at the very best time .
Great idea , good time .
Of course , when YouTube started , there was no commercial map of it .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he had a wonderful time .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
Ideas matter a lot .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really hungry for your birth .
And the unbelievable thing is that , outcomes don &apos;t come from the outcomes , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work very , very reliably in terms of time .
As I said earlier , institutions can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of those conversations are helpful in increasing the chances of your success , and then making the world a little bit better and not the other way around .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 A.m. on September 2016 we saw the biggest data shark in history . &#93; &#91; Financial Civilization devastated wealthy and powerful people &#93; &#91; A cross-border slogan &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Robert Prize to the Gulf Wenters . &#93; &#91; A cross-border platform which sits at the center of this
From the Panama , these innovators painted the books from the small shell companies .
We found the inner stories of villages , bananas and chocolate that would visit museum forms and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we need a housekeeping company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messaging , you can look at the way it &apos;s done , how it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The president of Arizona has been celebrated .
We &apos;ve also heard about the horrible drought factories in the United States of America .
The revenue of the two billion dollars goes to the original Mermaid Part of Russia from his childhood friend , a famous sitcom .
And a lot of rich people are going to be dead , and those of us who tell stories later , are going to be homeless stories .
Now that sounds like a magical movie or a John Gaulty story with me .
What should we draw from it ?
But it &apos;s true that corporations and corporations put their money where they shouldn &apos;t pay as much tax revenues as they should , meaning that effective measures like teachers get less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization at Galapagos Vision , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people have influenced the weapon companies that we &apos;re exploring out loud .
I think it &apos;s a cool , cheap world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can start a company with another company inside , a second company inside , so it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind this curtain .
It &apos;s hard for institutions ruling law , journalists , schools to understand what &apos;s happening .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s particularly interesting in the United States .
Perhaps that &apos;s why the popular Americans don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in smart companies .
That &apos;s why the raw companies , the U.S. Foundation , have a few .
I think if we look at the discoveries of Kim Illinand or the doodle or the Euros or nomad , what connects the United States .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give a lot of information , you have to give less information to go to the company than the Liber Council does .
This kind of information is thrown away in American schools .
It makes it easier for minority investment .
This kind of ritual affects all of us .
Now in the Galapagos Ventures , we wanted to look at what the problem is .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we converted a subsidy and flew over 13 Honduran legal companies .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transport a village across the United States to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The destructive thing was that all of the villages could have predicted a metaphor of how the village could transport the soul .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t create our cash for anyone and we didn &apos;t pay anyone , but this was how the system got worse .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual lawyers who talked about our hidden assumptions and our experiences .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who &apos;s found in Sindle .
It &apos;s a system that functions , that protects touch , that &apos;s open , that &apos;s durable and unsustainable .
And to be able to do that , we have to change this game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder for these kinds of situations .
It can be awesome , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always there .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
So in the last few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This issue was established on political hangers-on , but the British President David Comedy put it in at 8 o &apos;clock in the South Land in 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been forming a central record of the northern tip , whether or not there are actually any companies in Europe or are controlling them .
The downside is that the U.S. is behind it .
The contradictions in terms of regulatory laws in the center and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to get any higher , so we turned five .
We want to look at innovations , larger sectors , which are used throughout the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Galapagos Ventures .
People should be concerned about the atrocities that they know behind barbed wire companies .
Don &apos;t listen , listen up , for a curiosity like this . We do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and dare to change the law of transparent information .
We can aggregate the frequency of the frequency between the text and the text message and the text message .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that the Lex , the inventor of you , has made , in the past several years , so much more sensitive to the media than all the rest of the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Song : Yeah , can it be true ?
This is an announcement — isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing the equivalent to producing a small group of workers to produce information that is far more than all the other media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people form documents ?
And how do you balance them ?
Julie Song : Yeah , here we are . I can tell you — public services are provided in the right way , and we have so many ways that they can get the information to us .
So we use a lot of great weapons to keep the materials from one place to the Internet , to spread the signs to legal reports like Sweden and Bollywood .
We get the information from the cloud , from ordinary data , Ram Shah or whatever , organizing it like normal news organizations , making it very difficult sometimes , when you &apos;re talking about massive information for the public and then protecting yourself against indomitable legal and political leaders .
CA : So you have to try to make sure the evidence is real , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;re going to get this information all the time , and if we &apos;re going to get it at some point , we &apos;re going to get it out of the skin .
( Gunshot ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s coming from here and asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , that &apos;s the Koral report .
It was a hidden magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was there for 18 years .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when the book came out — due to the authoritarian powers who were trying to figure out how to fix the Koran , they bought 20 million pounds of this report , one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to mobilize its political will , which was the wealthiest man — now the wealthiest man in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
So I went to Kenya in 2007 , and we were able to achieve this just before the very election , December 2008 .
When we did that report , we made that report three days after the new president decided to volunteer , and Kabash decided to volunteer to the person who he was suffering from from , Daniel Arp , so that &apos;s how the report was held and launched into the prison camp .
CA : And — so , I mean , to cut a long story short , that this thing was laid out in Kenya , not out of sync , but out of medium , and it changed the outcome of choice .
GG : Yeah . This is the heavy land of Gaddafin and then it spread across all of the provinces in Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he , after a few days , convinced Kenyan entrepreneurs that they could talk about him .
And this blog was run on TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the vote , according to an Italian sex report , and it changed the result of that .
CA : Oh , so how did your secret breakfast actually change the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re going to show a little video of a couple of seconds .
It &apos;s a lonely video , but here &apos;s a little clip of something .
This — I &apos;ll tell you , this is a cardiovascular video .
RD : It &apos;s really cool when you first pick them up with two .
I thought , oh , there are four things with them .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s OK . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re in your throat , tell me , go away .
Hello .
Go ! Go !
( Clanking sounds ) Gill gets lost . Gill goes . ( Clanking sounds ) Gill gets lost .
HP : Huh . Blah master , two , six .
We have to go now . It &apos;s time .
Okay , so we killed eight people .
Here we see two Hilly Kepler , and we &apos;re still running the Gulf .
Rajasthan . He &apos;s on my side .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hi . Okay . Yeah , I beat them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julie Sung : People who worked on it had a very strong impact on it .
We finally did a couple of other surveys .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
CA : So there were 11 people who voted in this case , right ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! The two employees of the Reuters , two little kids were dead .
Essentially , from 18 to 26 people were killed .
Chris Anderson : And he had a wonderful time with what he did .
What was the fundamental reason that regret used to make you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can look at themselves as something of a deep inequality of power .
On the one hand , some perfumers are moving in the street , and then a kilometer away from the neighborhood , the Koran begins to scratch 30 kilometers of coastal plants on everyone — any of them — and they also kill the infants .
They also had two journalists who weren &apos;t brave , because they were brave .
Chris Anderson : According to the US intelligence agency , Broadline Manning was released , and it &apos;s been said that he had acknowledged in Crete that he had shown this video to you , 280,000 and white American documentaries as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Song : So we decided to accept the doctrine .
It &apos;s been tried five days ago , getting 150,000 documentaries and 50 gallons .
But we &apos;ve gone and turned it into a documentary of the River and the American safety house at the beginning of the year , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of articles from the American safety house ...
Julie Song : We will follow them . ( CA : Can you do that ? ) Julie Song : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) June Song : Because this kind of thing shows you that right now , for example , Arab governments , they are outperforming human rights violations in these governments .
If you look at the hidden evidence , these types of materials are in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy typically ?
Why should you believe the hidden information ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , the question is how important information in the world can be collected .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They spend an enormous amount of information on corporations to keep track of information , and that &apos;s a good indication when information should come out and do something good with it , because the organizations know better , and they know better about it , and they care about it .
And that &apos;s what we found in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of innovation .
CA : But are there risks to this individually or collectively remoteness societies where innovation doesn &apos;t exist ?
Julian Sanging : This is not what we did with the doctrines .
I mean , our big , well-intentioned exercise .
With information we can gather in a very specific way the information that is being transmitted — the information that &apos;s available to someone else .
But there are also some mysteries — like your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magical way — but we &apos;re talking about public services that come in and out of nowhere .
CA : OK , so they do it with the heart attack .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is in the United States Senate , and she says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something so much that some people like to blame other people .
Here &apos;s an American philosophy of the dead .
Which affects — but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is a military coup .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Song : Here &apos;s how we get asked a lot of questions like this .
But remember in the abaya , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what they think , it doesn &apos;t matter what they perceive .
Because they all see it every day .
It will change the mindset and the mindset that all of this money gives , and that is our hope .
CA : OK , so you seem to be hopeful for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light you have to maintain resilience like your own mind ?
Julian Sanging : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the compassion that is inspired by other minds .
If they do this , it &apos;s a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to be doing it tomorrow .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , what we did to make the point — is that this is where the invisibility came from .
You can also predict that there will be different kinds of crazy ideas about Lux and Julia .
One is the hero of the people who hope .
Or the problem .
What is the point of view from Hero ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! There must be something .
CA : These are very good people , Julie , very good .
We have to try more . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t experienced yet , but I think for TED you &apos;ve done it .
Now that &apos;s a really interesting story , right ?
What is this ?
Julie Song : This is a metaphor for what we do every day .
So at the end of last year — there &apos;s been a lot of important roads built in the bananas , as in the cell culture , but not so big .
And we got the Report Corporation — which was a very good study about it — which was to say that , in fact , conservation entrepreneurs from different backgrounds had to stick out and watch out .
And it had some former military governments and whatever .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were pretty sure that perhaps this company did all this in a very competitive game .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it sounds good to look , but we can &apos;t anticipate it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter one week after the paper that he wrote , he wanted to look at the device . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to look at the device . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how successful you are in favor of it ?
Is it really you ? And then they brought us what we think of as Scripture with the name of philanthropy and iPod .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It has happened so many times .
It &apos;s a way of communicating and thinking about what material is , and that is to try to write letters to these people .
CA : All right . So how far do you get the information from the inside ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we &apos;re struggling to come up with multiple , multi-dimensional tasks just like the tough ones .
Our introduction to this has been somewhat successful in a couple of months because we &apos;re moving our backyard system up because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s rainfall .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s flourishing , we &apos;re overwhelmed by our capabilities for aging , and that means we &apos;re overwhelmed by public goods at large numbers , but we don &apos;t have enough people to be able to anticipate and anticipate all that information .
CA : So that &apos;s the problem , fundamentally , with the ambition of journalists or journalists ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the kinds of materials that we have in common have to deal with so that we can get those people together and we have to deal with so much sensitivity in the material of regulation , and then less sensitive to things .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think where I learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julia Sangg : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the city , so the effect was both of those things .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , but let &apos;s just say that with something you can produce , intelligence is a mess .
Julie Song : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a hero at the age of a young man and you were in search of hard work .
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl in that moment when I was punished .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Russian hardware that &apos;s used by your grandmother to break bank accounts .
That &apos;s why the word , it &apos;s not very helpful anymore .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about them and maybe an event in your life that helped them survive ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe what &apos;s going on .
But the basic value : good , affordable and evil people do not create compassion ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s what I learned from my father and some of the other brave and courageous people in my life .
CA : Brilliant and healthy people don &apos;t create waste products ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a young man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing up , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of raising a victim , which is approaching the police department .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s in my office for a very long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve been talking just recently about : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you &apos;ve done something out there , you &apos;ve had a problem with a bank , and then the newspapers there have been silenced about storytelling .
Instead , they scaled up your expectations .
That makes you very famous in the U.S. , and then what happened ?
Julie Song : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
The Asian Landers had a crisis .
There he was .
The bankers there were 10 percent more likely to benefit from the rest of the country &apos;s GDP .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the ruler Tilly Weidmann , just five minutes before he was released , as a movie : a modern-day immigrant News Dick , and the state of the News Rider was saying , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spent a lot of time , and we became very popular in the U.S. , and I went to East Land and talked about this problem .
And the elements of the people there were things that shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the sixth-graders of the East Land , working with some other international experts , we named Ace Lindland a different kind of law , so it was a kind of freedom media , as a result of the most protected space for journalists all over the world , new Nebullys with free light .
A native NASA Lander is like a nurse , which means the system is going upwards down .
And just a month ago , NASA &apos;s parliament declared this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you realize that it &apos;s more likely to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Song : I can &apos;t believe where the situation will go .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure to disagree with the law of liberty and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
Who gets that connection ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move it either side or side .
Chris Anderson : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience here to say , Galen , honored , and all that power is for you .
Julie Sung : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is milk .
I was watching my children walk through the concrete slums , and it was shocking in the slums .
When I grew up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I got this call .
My team was shocked .
And when I saw it from a sort of personal point of view , I realized somehow how how how how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the Ministry of Agriculture , wherever I went , surprisingly , in North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in London , there were four creatures that were characterized by wildlife — okay , silence and code .
And I thought that was kind of weird , and I was wondering whether anyone else would ever have had this jar of candy .
And when I took that opportunity , I realized people weren &apos;t looking at these iconic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
By restricting nature to a few elements , there is no unusual human nature .
This is something we did 10,000 years ago when we eliminated our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s got rock and heavy ; you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see just four animals : seven , cow , ship and cattle .
It &apos;s also true of wishes .
You look at mines 150 or 200 years ago in the streets of New York City , you will see pictures , sticks and sticks .
But if you look at the distance from here , you &apos;re going to see just four floors — race , race , but Venus .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Cheers .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
World War II , we had the greatest excitement of being alive .
During the Great War , we had advanced technology , like the Sun , the Hole in the Wall , and everything was shaking up .
And since the end of the Second World War , there have been four major breakthroughs of mass survival .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that salt flowers and salmon flowers have increased dramatically , and within two years its income has increased concentration .
Now if you collect foreign fighters and war campaigns , they will be identical to two Chinese each year .
My favorite example of using Chinese is not the only one , because China is not the largest country , it &apos;s also the largest one .
Now let &apos;s turn to our kitchen .
First of all , the U.S. and the West have the most utilized salt food .
The Gulf is an extremely bad product .
Only a handful of forest flowers are killed by 5,000 , 10 , 15 pounds of forest flowers to get to the market .
The Indus civilization also has an unbelievable definition .
In a study done in the Dharavi University , it showed that reading from a garbage heap was a very inefficient use of Indians .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the remains of sunflowers in the tropics are the wars of Mongolia .
Now let &apos;s look at these cool little girls .
They document the foot of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , the safety of the beaches , the yogurt and the yogurt of children , all sorts of important things to the atmosphere .
This is what happened to the forests of Management .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years eating billions of canals .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; the Nemo knee . &quot; &quot; Throughout the metropolitan area you just saw , it &apos;s very controversial .
Now there &apos;s been some recent years that small bugs are flying out of the jar , but with it , with a large number of other bugs , they transform into food after the plant .
And many times it &apos;s been taken out of slums that lay the name &quot; &quot; Red &quot; &quot; butterflies , and that &apos;s the moment we like to look at the river , and that means that the ecosystem itself is storing and maintaining itself .
Then there &apos;s the second big food disappeared in the United States and the West .
Tony is a global citizen .
Tony needs to look at a very large area in order to organize like a knee .
We also have a region called the physical mining unit , or ICCAT — the Internet Poetry Exploration Commission .
Carl Simpson also volunteered to discover all the technology .
We can stand for a tummy rug , but Tony &apos;s not very good at sweating .
Many people don &apos;t know , but Tony &apos;s carrying heat .
She can break 40 miles an hour and temperature around her body can heat up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit .
All the benefits of bread are closed .
The blood vessels on the floor are supply chromosomes that don &apos;t last very long .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creature is 40 miles away from the coast , and it cannot stay in the forest .
Even though time has been bad , it doesn &apos;t take long for it to go downhill .
This is my political connectome .
The connectome conquered the forest .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a document .
There are 3,000 signs in contact policies .
For example , I say connectome is large . ( Laughter ) If anyone solves the power of a connectome , I think we can dramatically change the world .
And everywhere , these are rocks driven by the awkwardness of their children .
As a result , we came to the favelas and we had a successful military coup .
When the peacekeepers began , Sam was sticking six feet to build a foundation of Sam .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s a lot of false water , because if you look at the footprint of the footprint , it &apos;s called the footprint of peace .
Whereas this Food is chalked with mystery .
It &apos;s hard to say what &apos;s wrong with pneumonia and pneumonia .
But then again , the credit industry is pushing towards creating alternative vehicles against Pandora Smith .
This is a system producing oxytocin that is spreading geysers .
It &apos;s been seven percent of the year .
Even though we are spending a lot less money to get to the market , we are also spending a lot of money to get to the market .
Not only do we create milk , but we create milk and eggs .
We have these mosquitos that are producing chickens and bits that are being eaten .
Because on the left , the blood and the hands are picked up and the mosquitos are picked up .
I &apos;m also fascinated by what he did , but he also started to scratch the surface .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been taken out of the sea .
It &apos;s equal to the third term of China or the number of Americans that come out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philistines actually started as lions .
And it started to look like the owner of a local entrepreneur who saw that the everyday gathering was never going to go to McDonald &apos;s .
He went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a fundraiser for you . &quot;
The lights are out .
What the Indus script does for the rest of the world , it &apos;s a proof that the Indus script does not die .
So he built his lift song .
Unfortunately , the Indus script lasted for 30 seconds .
He wanted to make a 25-centimeter commercial , so he brought the electronic code .
Actually , the Philadelphia Sandwich is the largest traditional art industry in the United States , moving two to three billion pounds a year from the Millennium Development Goals .
If we stop polling , the current election might be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the protein in a very dynamic way in animal protein , and this is a three-dimensional world .
It &apos;s actually a very remarkable solution ; it grows from an individual in nine months .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a windmill .
It doesn &apos;t have the ACE and DHE campaign that we think will be living all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That represents a large , three-millionth of a cent .
One possibility is that conservation policies have enabled us to eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of framing it ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a wonderful childhood when they go to the marketplace , where a typical slice of slavery is in comparison with a slice of slice , and the effect is at the top of the ranks of India .
This is October 3 , EPA and DIY .
So this is her ability .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a pound , and then turned it into a footprint and stuck it into a footprint and then paid a second price to pay the guys two dollars a day , could we figure out a way to eat the food ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPAA and ADHD .
The calculus was extremely effective .
Indonesia &apos;s revenues are only three thirds of the cost of meat to the market .
Actually the typical three waves come from the kitchen .
The sea level rises by three o &apos;clock in the morning , and they just get there .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our bureaucracy has been created by Facebook and Netization .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 species have been produced , these are the major causes of sea life expectancy .
And as you might think about clicking , in all these different ways , proteins and , at least three , are highly effective indicators .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a mineral that can provide harmful substances to desalination proteins .
These creatures should be bright green , growing and changing environments have their own capabilities as well as their cumulative matrix , and they should be EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and Fitch East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I do this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try .
And it &apos;s time to try .
If we could do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is living in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to be a little crazy .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was born to teach the brain because I have a brother who is suffering from a brain disease called schizophrenia .
As a scientist , I later wanted to understand , how can I embrace my dreams from my reality and create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what &apos;s happening is that he does not blame his dreams as a public and a shared reality , and he does his job .
So I dedicated my life to finding serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked at the President Financial Bank , which was the head of the Harvard University campaign .
So what &apos;s the difference between the mathematical level of the brain of people who generally think about it as being compared to the brain of people who are suffering from Shodopitha or Baylor Death ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is to actually build the microscopic map of the brain , whose cells are messing with the chemical and quantity of the brain ?
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I used to do this kind of stuff during the day , but on Friday and Saturday , at four o &apos;clock , I visited the NAMI airport on a visit to NASA .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intelligent desert .
The left side of my brain was a nose .
And for the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and remember something in the morning of college .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever seen similar brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that is sitting with the back of the brain , the arm of the hippocampus , and this is how it sits in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;re going to see two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
For those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain acts like a parallel processor while the left part of our brain acts like a solar processor .
Those two pieces communicate messages to each other through the crossword puzzle that some 300 volunteers carry .
But nevertheless , both sides are identical .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing that part of the brain knows a different kind of information , their attitudes are about different things , and if you allow me to give you a sense of who they are , very different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . That &apos;s it .
Audience : Yeah , it worked .
( Laughter ) The evidence we have in our brains right now is to think about the moment .
Here &apos;s what our brains are thinking about right now in our brains , and it &apos;s thinking organically about the movements of our bodies .
Information is stored and stored in our bodies for a very long time , across all of our nervous systems , and then it &apos;s downloaded and turned into a great Islamic class , which in the case of existence , we can see how to feel and how to feel in the mind .
I &apos;m an energy geeks spreading through the energy of my surrounding the brain via the sense of the brain .
We have energy systems that are moved around from each other through the perception of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers and sisters on this planet whose wisdom is to improve the world .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left-hand part of our brain is thinking scientifically and politically .
The rest of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is like taking our greatest icon / cloud and analyzing it and then processing it .
And it also informs all of this information that is organized and gathered around all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past and the possibilities of the future — namely , our beliefs .
The symbols on our left think about language .
It &apos;s this continuous conversation that connects us and our inner world to the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice telling me that you have to remember to go home and buy it .
I need them in the morning ; it &apos;s my philosophy of arithmetic book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice she says ! I am !
And as my left brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m isolated .
I become the only person in the world with the incredible energy around me and with you .
And the only part of my brain that morning was filtered with a fire hydrant .
My left eye on the morning of the college campaign morning , with an injection of raw pain .
It was the kind of stressful pain that comes from getting somewhere .
And that pain has connected me and left me behind .
And then he turns and he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never suffered from any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing I can do with my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to the locker and I looked at my cartoon guide , which is the previous body transport mechanism .
Now I &apos;ve been fascinated by this mechanism , because I feel like I &apos;m holding a hand to someone who has just touched Donna .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s kind of weird . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I think that &apos;s a really weird and weird thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I had changed my mind , which is the general sense of truth in which I &apos;m a human being being sort of spiraling out of that experience , but now I was in a very humble and
And this was all very strange and poor , and my heart was blowing .
So I got out of the car and I started walking around the room and I realized that everything inside my body was so simple .
And everyone is thinking very hard and very hard .
I have no relationship with speed , and I think there &apos;s a housekeeping problem , so I &apos;m just focusing on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my backyard and ready to dig under the water , and I &apos;m really just putting a room inside my body .
I heard a sound that was saying , and my foot has to play you now .
Oh , my foot goes down , and then my balance is not balancing , so I &apos;m holding on and hearing the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t recalibrate my body &apos;s suffering anymore .
I don &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped , because my hand was held by Tom and Michael &apos;s wall with Tom and Michael .
If I was going to understand something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s when the whole thing on the left of my brain got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s been speaking a TVs with a remote control .
A breath .
First , I was struck by the noise in my brain .
But then immediately , I came across this huge wave of energy in the slum around me .
And since I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body , I felt so proud and so strong .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a lesbian . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I told myself I &apos;m really bored from any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really tired of the problem , but I came back quickly with a sense of what I say for a long time .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think of it as being beautiful in a place where you &apos;re completely irrelevant to this tiny brain that surrounds you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere where where where my work is pushing forward .
I was feeling a lot of shame in my body .
And look at all the relationships that you have from the outside world and from that point of view had been stressed out .
And I felt a sense of peace and courage .
And look at what it would look like if you flew back from this 70-year-old emotional weight that you had .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a herbal pesticide .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left side of my brain and he said , &quot; Hey ! Don &apos;t slow down . &quot;
We need help . And I &apos;m thinking that I should help my heart be proud of it , so I cut home from the honey house , and I &apos;m busy stuck in my apartment now , and I &apos;m thinking , can I go to work and drive ? &quot; &quot; And this is the moment where my mother has absolutely passed away .
It was then that I realized that my God was attacking me by forgiveness , the first thing my mind tells me is how wonderful it is .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
There will be some brain researchers who will come to realize this time that they can consciously contract their own brain , and they can move into my brain . ( Laughter ) Then one of my brain was like , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m so enthusiastic . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into this . &quot; &quot; So I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t have time to go into this .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fight flight , but I &apos;ll get back to my normal in a couple of weeks . OK .
I have to call out for help . I have to call my office . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the dignity of work , and then I realized I had my own business card on the phone number .
Then I go into my studio and I create a three-dimensional motion cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card as I can see with my naked eyes what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , not because I can &apos;t look at a dot .
And the words on the page were held by point of view and point of view , and I was not getting any page .
And then I started waiting for what I call a symbol of depression .
And at that time , the general was repeated , and I realized that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download a single inch .
And during that period of 45 minutes the effects of the gymnosophist were on the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I don &apos;t have any other way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took the banks and I put them there , and now I &apos;m going to look at the cards of all the girls who watch the phone books on the page .
But then I turn to my own halfway back when I didn &apos;t remember that I made that number , that I didn &apos;t .
So I raised my hand like a Danish , and I put it on Hindus , and then I put the boxes on the other hand to say , &quot; &quot; When I came back to the normal truth , I can tell you that I went Hindus first , and then finally came all the way to Hindus , and I heard that on the phone , a guy answered the phone , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot;
Then I say to her , &quot; I &apos;m speaking clearly in my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And the voice from me says something like &quot; &quot; Wooo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; Then he came to me that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he supported me .
And a little while later on in an ambulance , Sierra Leone was rushing to the hospital by Massachusetts General .
I walked up and looked like a child with a bread .
Just like the one cloud that happened while the rest of the world went out of the poor , I pulled out my energy and I was feeling helpless .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer welcome in my life .
Or perhaps my doctor has saved me and offered me a second life or a threat to my transport .
When I went to the other , it was amazing to me that I still lived .
When I felt proud of my spirit , then I gave life to God .
Now my brain was experiencing two contradictions between reality .
It was at that time that my emotional system started to develop activities that only felt in pain .
The light was shining my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were so close and dim that I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , or I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , and I was just peddling further down the street .
Because I couldn &apos;t really understand the anatomy of my body , so I felt very large and broad , like someone who was free from their bones .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a huge herd running through the sea of rain .
Great Firewall .
I got the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking it was never possible that I would discover my greatest sense of humility and my ability to learn within the small body .
But it was then that I realized , &quot; But I am still alive ! &quot;
I still live and have a nerve .
And if I have been brought to sleep , and I still live , then whatever life is , it can happen , and I &apos;ve seen a world filled with beautiful , respectful , comfortable and loving people who know they can someday feel that quality .
And they can pick up John and choose , and the truth is that the book that they want to put on the left side of their brain in search of this comprehensive quality .
And then I understood how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of versions that taught me how to live my life .
And he invited me to be healthy .
After a period of intense destruction of the gymnosophist , the soul extracted the blood vessels from my brain equivalently to the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
It took me eight years to get healthy .
So who are we ?
We are the power of spacecraft , the ability and two extremely high minds .
And we have the power to choose for a certain part of who we are and what we want to be in the world .
It &apos;s a place where , &quot; &quot; I can move beyond my consciousness , &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
50 lovely organic cells are made up of organic , semi-autonomous cells , one in which everything is .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual , in a tiny way .
From the quantum leap .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
In my &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; exists .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain scanning electrical activity , the more we put peace in this world and the more our planet is moving .
And I thought that was something that needs to be resolved .
Thank you .

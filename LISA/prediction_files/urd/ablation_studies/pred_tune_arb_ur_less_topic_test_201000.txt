Hi !
You are there ?
They took my name , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No ! No ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , long ago , I was sitting in the restaurant with my friend and I were eating .
So I asked the question , do you have a free lunch in Arabic ?
He looked at me strange , he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The Council of Divine , in Arabic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Hey , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; And she said .
And he was talking to me , like he was saying to me , &quot; If this girl is the last girl in the world , I can &apos;t see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic mean ?
A linguistic teenager took two words and placed a girl specifically in two words , and Jill .
How does he speak this way ?
So that &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What is it that I get from my country to the right to linguistic scripts ?
Where could it be ?
How did we get there ?
Now while we &apos;re here , there are many people like me , who reach a stage in their lives where they routinely leave out everything that &apos;s going on in their backyard , only because they &apos;re very popular and deceived .
Should I welcome my whole culture , my imagination , my faith and my sisters ?
Perhaps the most important battles we have are saved by the stories of children .
should they all recite what I learned in Arabic ?
to be like that ?
How does that make sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision for God in the way that he did for me .
Arabic doesn &apos;t require what today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or research , or language that we &apos;re using in neuroscience , or a language that we &apos;re using in a workspace at work , in a language that we defined when we &apos;re working on a research program , and it &apos;s really not a language that we spoke at the moment when we apply Health .
If we did , they would follow up on our shelves .
So , where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s a second really important thing we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of the mother .
And research shows that in order to get the skill in other languages , you need to translate that into your own mother tongue .
In other languages , the intrinsic language is the main building block for creativity .
How ?
The jihad cell type , when he first started writing , exploited Arabic .
All of his thoughts , his imagination and philanthropy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a special wonder , felt a special voice , and thought about a special idea .
When they started to write in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their texts in English , you felt gratitude , you felt the same sense .
So you can imagine these are also in English with the same text as this little boy who was standing in a trench all alone .
Now , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s emerging societies .
Ramadan , France , Japan and China all have those things .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their tongue .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in products , they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know better ?
Right , we &apos;re not from the developed world , it &apos;s a more polarized thought we haven &apos;t yet , and we want to move into this developed world .
It was a country that looked like ours in a period of time , but it decided to try and push it up , to research , and move it into those countries , like Tamil , employee , etc . , they were able to translate their language into English as they drove the students away , to protect them against the waves .
They &apos;ve brought it down .
Because if you go to Turkey or Wheel and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe these are local manufacturing .
And they will be entitled in these consumers , unknown consumers , as we know them more time .
So to come up with new inventions and applications , they had to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Independence , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about the conversation , only words are affected by us .
Languages contain patterns of our lives , and words that are connected to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Independence , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a unique location in your brain , unique emotions , for a given day in a unique history .
Language is not about breaking one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an insight into what we think , and how we look at each other and how we see each other .
What is our physiology ?
How are you going to get it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , well , I &apos;ll go and spend a lot of time dicking around .
The thing is , it reminds us of a particular thing .
I have a friend from Francesca who &apos;s a French speaker .
I was asking her one more time .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to pronounce his husband and translate it one night to what it means to &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And this woman called her the &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then she spent the night trying to understand .
And he wondered , how could such a veil be ?
Do they want to self-destruct ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand what this word meant , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way to think about it was different .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , he tells me the FedEx , and one night , I tried to translate to him how he felt when I heard FedEx . &quot; &quot; The whole woman attempted to translate it : &quot; &quot; Well , I raised my hand and you caught it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And SM : And because you &apos;re me , I put my hand up and you leave . &quot;
translate . show me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We changed it for a society , and we started to speak Arabic .
While lots of people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Please don &apos;t worry . Please don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protocol heard a saying , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose this way , because in this way , we would not understand them .
And if somebody tells me , I don &apos;t like the Arabic language .
We call ourselves — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in the way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
A letter looks like us and the way we think .
So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; The right symbols sit .
It &apos;s very easy , but cost-effective .
Later , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on the ground .
You , have seen outside of it , an environment in which the letter is black and blue on the bottom , with the text , &quot; Do not kill language . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We really don &apos;t have to kill our tongue .
If we killed our language , we would have to know a Dutch for ourselves .
We must find a existence for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great opportunity for harm , new and religion .
Later on , we found boys and girls who were already in Arabic .
Kole models of girls and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve picked the word &quot; &quot; collar . &quot; &quot; They want to make a fuss about it , but I have to write a word that &apos;s so good and so on .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not motels ! We shouldn &apos;t have to hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we need to let everybody know that we are not going to allow anyone to open up or think that we are going to have a choice in language , putting pressure on us , putting pressure on our patients and thinking .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t rebuild the rocket or something , we can be creative again .
Now , each and every one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start with today .
They make a fuss or a short film .
Once again , we can go to a global level .
She can bring the second Arabic language to the prize .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , part of this solution .
Honestly , what can you do today ?
Which of you are Twitter ?
For the Muslim , I refuse to give you , even though , my time has run out , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the numbers , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin letters !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spam ! It &apos;s no language .
You enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to identify one another .
We &apos;ve come here to appreciate the need for language .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a section .
A child , for the first time , has to read his father &apos;s linguistic script .
When my daughter is born , I can &apos;t tell her , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , ya . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is your dad , honey , and I made a promise to my daughter in the store , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom , &quot; &quot; won &apos;t say .
And it is not expected that anyone will ever know . ( Applause ) You have to get rid of this culture of press . ( Applause )
I &apos;m speaking to you , teach us , to remind us that we have no option but to what my circumstances are , and that descendants of my people who have been messing up on me until you see my generation , we have not seen a planet where we have lived through this generation of inequality , and it has not gotten our generation good until they become popular with trials , where we don &apos;t have as
( Applause )
I love the desktop client .
In college , I had my primary career path , which meant I had to write to death .
Now the average person when they write something , here &apos;s what happens .
You know , you guys — ( Laughter ) You might just start working very quickly , but first week , they do a lot of work and most of the work , just after that , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s good . ( Laughter )
And that &apos;s what I want to do .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
Well , all of the stuff is ready , but actually the text function will get there , and then I &apos;ll do something like that .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens to every text function .
And then came along new papers of finished research , the text that you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal actions were not good enough for this kind of approach .
It was a huge task .
I stuck in a plan , I decided that I would do something like this .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m going to start small amounts of work , in the middle years , going to increase the pace of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard will it be to read ?
No big thing , right ?
And then something ridiculous happened .
How about a few months ?
Go and go , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a great project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then she would be gone , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were all there .
And two months went into a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went out one day and I spent three days in the Dutch , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote down 90 pages , two streets , and people were on these — they didn &apos;t have to go on two streets — two streets that were lingered , and they were spending time in constant time , and they were all going on the D@@
I thought , this is it .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you jam ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , it &apos;s the best . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was a huge believer . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be a cheerleader in that moment , when you all were thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s amazing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it &apos;s very powerful .
Well , today I log .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
Some years ago , I started writing about lists .
I &apos;ve always had six people attack me , and I wanted to tell the six people what &apos;s going on in the brain and why we &apos;re depressed .
Now , my hypothesis was that the brain &apos;s making differences between six people .
to find out that I made a lab where I could actually encode the brain of both these brains and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , it &apos;s not that great , but consider it .
So here is the brain of a six person .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of them have a decade ahead of their time , but the rest of the brain is in the human brain that &apos;s entertaining .
Now , what does this mean in a test tube ?
I mean , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work Challenging is a good time . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart man will make a decision to make a point , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he listened to the audience , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t have a piece of card reading , &quot; &quot; and the Scandal of Tudhope , because I know it &apos;s happened right now .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;ll go to the auditorium , and you &apos;ll see what happened in 10 minutes with something new ?
Then you look at YouTube , and they start talking about the race in the Reddit Fund , and much later on they end up watching the videos on Twitter .
( Laughter ) It &apos;ll take some time for all of these things , so it &apos;s not going to take much time to do anything with it today .
Francesca ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the foundation of compassion that you want to call .
It just wants to be in that moment .
It understands the unimaginable future , but it &apos;s only about two things : compassion and mercy .
In animals &apos; world , that &apos;s all well .
If you can and you spend a lot of your lives doing this , you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Cooked food , good thought , and increased talent , in the last few years , probably looks like this .
But if you haven &apos;t , the tribe is no more .
We are a progressive civilization , and we don &apos;t even know it .
So here &apos;s another person in our brain , a minority who &apos;s deciding , can make us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are remote .
We make big projects .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is make us happy when we do .
Sometimes it seems just the right thing to do , that the easiest and the most joyful thing to do is to eat , sleep or enjoy the opportunity moment .
Here &apos;s why .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult , for a big cause .
And this is the real zipper .
And for the rest of the audience , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends more time in the short term , a simple and joyful way that many of the times are outside .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) The playground is a place that people are very familiar with .
There &apos;s an age in which merit shouldn &apos;t be a romance .
In a dark field that tells you that it &apos;s not really a chore , because it &apos;s not just you , it &apos;s a crime , a fear , an encouragement , and it &apos;s all of the characteristics that are in the right place .
The question is , in this case , when the basic problem is dominated , how do the rest of the body get into the veil , which is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that the Sistine people are also safe , guaranteed at all times in their exact moments — someone said to him the House .
( Laughter ) Now this is a house that &apos;s more common , but when it &apos;s closer to downloading , it &apos;s a good thing , or it &apos;s at times when people are threatened by embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that the original is just the same .
Now , this has been a real relation to my life , because six months ago , people at TED had called me and gave me the TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
I wish I was involved in TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my intention and anger , something else was happening in the brain of the deepest decisions .
And he was saying , &quot; Did you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to be like in the future ?
We should just start working on this . He said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I do it . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India down to about 20,000 feet , and we &apos;ll just break our house until we see all India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did what we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided to celebrate the name of the proponents .
I broke the web and there was a photograph of me holding leaflets .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) House control , and a set of seconds said it was on demand . ( Laughter )
And remember in the winter — he &apos;s a horror of the homeless shelter — he walks up the tree !
And finally , and finally , long-term decision makers spontaneously came together and I can start talking .
Now , the homemade player who tells me that every form of writer is a crocodile , someone like me would have been killed two weeks , and the head of the line could not write , and then , incredibly , incredibly successful officials actually go to sleep every night and write .
And three key ingredients of clarity at this point — the system is called the escent people .
That &apos;s great , but not for the elixir .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
When I wrote this , I was shocked by the impact on this .
I &apos;ve actually received thousands of miles from around the world and from people , from different kinds of backgrounds .
They included nurses , bankers , engineers , peters and CDs .
( Laughter ) And everybody was telling me one story and writing : &quot; I too am in trouble . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of Emily &apos;s deaths and the number of Emily &apos;s deaths .
In the script of these people , the mainstream script was reading how much longer he had asked them to do with what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system &apos;s right , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
Well , it turns out the list is two compounds .
So today I gave you four examples , each of them on topics , all of them on data .
And when Death is online , recent effects are killed because of the household death .
But the Sun is a different kind of way , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data .
So if you want a project that you can start with , like some kind of arts or businesses — some kind of arts or businesses , until you start paying attention to acceleration , to keep going .
There are other things besides career , whose relationships you and I don &apos;t have to go with , like getting in your family , sporting , thinking about your health , finding your relationships , calling for the relationships that don &apos;t move past .
Now if the only way you can work is with a test tube , it &apos;s hard , because all of the data that you have in a situation is with the death rate .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do , and the consequences are that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And this is required for a kind of long tradition that &apos;s very little to look at and say that there &apos;s a lot less to do with respect to the deepest , the more violent offerings .
You are suffering from devastation and experience .
And this can be driven by the Taliban recovery and by the Taliban .
So I thought that was because of their email , and this is why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not good enough for a project .
The Taliban death system has opened their eyes , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot maintain their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and it showed one thing — I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are a soldier .
You may not have a very complex situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) and some of you may have good relationships with some of the DNA links , but tricks you may remember when there &apos;s no Death Valley .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the Canadian of life .
Each block means a week , it &apos;s in the new year .
These are not very many blog posts , especially when some of them are posted .
I think we all need to be careful with this Canada .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion .
It is for all of us .
And there are not that many families we &apos;ve got , and perhaps we should start by doing this .
Perhaps not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know what .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
On that day , a document by the U.S. and Afghanistan , an eight-day dose of U.S. and Afghanistan was leaving Afghanistan from a region of Afghanistan , and it was leaving Afghanistan to support an office for the U.N. government to help them protect an office from the U.N. government , so that they could help us to protect a fund from the Afghan government to help them save the jobs that some of the
The archeologist came in at the cross section of an invasion , and he was surrounded by three other things , and with all that , you could see there was a crocodile covering the Cape Sevin , and you could see it was youth violating and you could erase the death .
One of the people he rescued , one of his children , and one of the most promising things , he was moving towards the hospital butcher and he was also moving towards the hospital level of prostitution .
So it showed that the Kepin Sevin and yang deserve this mycorrhiza that is grown in the winter .
They put them in Hole in the Wall computers , and then you see what they saw in the Cape Town and then buried them first before they allowed others to pay for children .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? It &apos;s such an emotion when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love there , and I knew why it was that I work with people that I don &apos;t .
You know , in the footage , you &apos;re given the people who are desperate to value themselves in the wire to value others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are yearning to value others so that we can be good .
We have an electrical calculation !
So I asked myself , where do such people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just the best people .
That &apos;s why they get to the fire .
These people seem to be looking after the idea of mercy , for the better people to look after the idea of mercy .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I learned that it &apos;s a environment , and if you have an environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , so that each and every one of us has the potential to work together and make it bigger and the ability to do that for others .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of getting some of these people , and we &apos;ve had the privilege of saying to me yesterday , and I &apos;ve had the privilege of getting some of these people , and I said to them yesterday , and they gave themselves their knowledge and their risks so that they could rescue others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a profound sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not victims .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Sit me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It is not possible that I give two people the chance to collaborate and do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this leave ?
If you go further back than 50,000 years ago , which is to say the beginning of the Homo sapiens , we see that the world is full of threats , all of those nets , and they &apos;re hard to measure .
There &apos;s no private thing .
Dream weapons could be a lack of resources , but it could be a long-term TEDster , and it &apos;s all those things that work together to reduce the longer lifespan of life , and they &apos;re all things that work together to make our lives poor .
And so that &apos;s why we were ready for social animals , where we were staying together and working together as I call the Charter of Compassion , as in a tribe where we felt about our personal connection .
And when we felt really secure in ourselves , we were pretty reassured and connected .
It has an ongoing waste .
It means I can sleep at night and I can browse to see some of the risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
That &apos;s the real zipper .
It &apos;s a world that &apos;s full of threats that are struggling to make our lives tough or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
These economies can rise as a result of what the stock market can look like .
It could be a new technology that you can take your commercial break and stick it away at night , it could be a new technology that you can take your commercial break and stay away at night .
Or it could be your opponent who &apos;s sometimes trying to kill you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s trying to get you to the top of it and trying to get your business to drop out of it , and it &apos;s trying to stop your balance and your businesses to look after you .
We do not control any of these powers .
It &apos;s an infinite thing , and it never ends .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the intensity is , because it &apos;s determined which way to look .
When a leader picks out to protect the people in his organization and their lives , they support the preserving and the lives of the people in his organization , and this is how they value their peace and their lust results so that people are there and that they sacrifice to make sure that people are there and that they feel secure and feel their personal relations , they have good values for things .
I was on a journey every day , and I advised an event that when a traveler attempted to leap into space before he &apos;d finished it , and I watched the clients at the doorway come to him like he had just breaked the law like he was doing .
One more time I tried to step on her , one more time I passed on her .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you tackle things like us ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit and work with people like us ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer back .
They do not trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Billions is not because they attract the Lamanic people to the top .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up on their leaders .
You see , if the circumstances are violent , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another , and we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from the other , and it shrills the outcome .
What &apos;s a great leader for her , and I can show you the most prominent example of how a parent is a good leader for her , and the most prominent example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent looks like , what would you like ? What is it made of ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our kids the opportunities , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our kids the opportunities , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the tools to grow and to do more of what we can do for ourselves to grow and to have more of what we can do for ourselves .
And that &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the opportunities to create self-esteem , to have fun and to work so that they can achieve more success that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more advanced achievements than ever imagined .
Charlie Kump , who &apos;s the head of a tech company in New York City , is the head of a technology company called Next Jump , and they &apos;re the head of a tech company in New York City , and they say one thing that if you have a tough time in your family , do you ever stop a kid ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people to come from our organization , and then how do we get people to work together ?
Charlie has a practical lack of employment , and Charlie has routinely lost the ability to use resources .
If you &apos;re working in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get stuck studying effective problems .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will mentor you and help you , in the same way that we would do to any of our kids who come to the school and go to the grades .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers from the CEO , and that &apos;s why all those people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from the CEO , that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from the CEO , whose unfortunate gifts are more sophisticated and so on .
This isn &apos;t about data .
Instead , they followed the fundamental principle of diversity .
They &apos;ve evolved a profound social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their well-meaning children to become the victims of their peers , and we know that they have ceased to sacrifice their well-meaning children , rather than that they have asked them to sacrifice their well-meaning children , rather than that they have asked them to sacrifice their well-meaning children .
That &apos;s what doesn &apos;t give us context , not data .
Can we predict , say , 150 million dollars for gold ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is that a problem we have ? Absolutely not .
Well , good leaders will never sacrifice the data for children .
Well , good leaders will never sacrifice the data for children .
Instead , they will give people skin statistics to babies , but they will give people skin statistics to babies .
They run a mining company in the Boston Media Collaboratory called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they run a mining company in the Boston Massacre called Barry Wehmiller , and they &apos;ve gone to the top 20 percent of their traffickers kers kers .
Now in a large mining company , it &apos;s a huge problem that they won &apos;t be able to tolerate their enemies more quickly .
They needed 10 million dollars , and so most of the companies today had to put together people like boards and do the right thing .
And Bob turns it on .
You see , the Bubble doesn &apos;t trust the branches .
Instead , babies believe in cheating , and it &apos;s much more difficult to cut deaths and to cut deaths that are more difficult .
And they built a dedicated program .
We needed everybody from the Critic to the CEO in a four-week vacation process .
They could never do that when they wanted to and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But the way the boy talks about the program is very important .
He said that it was better for all of us to do a little bit of damage than for some of us to do a lot of damage and get a lot of damage .
They &apos;ve saved 20 million dollars in this facility , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , they have confidence and natural connection .
And basically , as nobody expected , people started to trade each other .
The ones that were most successful did lead to business with low-achieving people .
That meant somebody had to give up five weeks to get somebody to just three weeks .
Jihad is an extreme , not a gift .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing , I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing the leaders who are not very good at it .
They &apos;re good citizens , and we do what they say , because we have access to them , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of an organization that have no option , and they &apos;re a real leader , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege to see their left-hand side , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been a privilege to see their left-hand side , and they have the privilege of seeing their right side .
He &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some physics that were out in the bush and like the philanthropist &apos;s way of cooking in honor and opening his men first , and when he was out , he did not have anything to do with it .
And when he came back to the field , his friends gave him some food from his food to eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them they do it .
We call them leaders because they take risks first , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them a leader because they choose to be a victim so that they can be preserved and we call them a leader because they choose to be a victim so that they can be preserved and we call them a leader because they choose to be a victim so that people can be preserved and do this , and when we do this , it is natural philanthropy that people cherish us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and milk and lead us to see what their aspiration is to become a leader , and then we &apos;ll ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your tissue and your ego to that person ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this to us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t this organization that we &apos;re going to like to work with ?
And aren &apos;t the kinds of organizations that we would all like to work for ? And aren &apos;t the kinds of organizations that we would all like to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the story of a small story about the Limpopo , the Limpopo , and the name of Mpumbai .
Where the water supply and the electricity is so unbelievable , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions at a time when I was 17 , I was staying still with friends in the deep section of the Death Valley .
In the winter , the sun is warm .
And as I was filling out in the bush , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t have to be touched ? &quot; &quot; So I sat down , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I just went home . &quot; &quot; And I did some research and I found some astonishing statistics .
Today , 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred and one half are in Africa , and there &apos;s only one in South Africa .
Different diseases accumulate in the environment , one of the most dangerous things we call the tragedy .
And so one of the reasons the Trachoma is because of the blind tasting , you can get more than one of the dropouts you can get on your way .
This disease consistently blames eight million people every year , and the most scary thing is , you only have to give up your egos for children in the trachoma : no dice , no cells , no engineering .
After looking at the graph data , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it , but I &apos;m doing it for less , because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , they ran some of their brothers from 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a broadband , no Internet , so I went to Google and did some research on Wikipedia , put it on Google ,
And I looked at this as a profound problem .
So , fortunately , we &apos;ve gotten ready .
Now we need to process this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on the phone , and after I write my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; now and still not ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first gold platform .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a rig .
( Laughter ) So after trying to be effective in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Health Media Collaboratory entered some new people , did some additional tasks , and now we have an impact on what &apos;s happening in the market , which is now available in the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at all .
They just buy the names they need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; they buy a ticket every day , because it just takes more money .
So we built DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just push it in and out .
And the best part about it is , there &apos;s an exchange for a slum in five ways .
Through the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about product adoption .
We even want rich-world children to come here to want DryBath — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
More recently , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water when they leave that jar and we could save two house for children who are in the rural areas , two hours , more than two hours for a school , two hours for two more homes , two hours for two more homes for the kid .
After looking at the global impact , we learned from this what our key values are : guidelines , safety and security .
DriBath is the service of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
Backing this project in the process , we &apos;re actually entering a phase where we &apos;re going to sell it into a multinational charter that can be put into the retail market , and a question that I &apos;m going to ask you to do today , on the verses of the Limpopo , in one week , to identify a 50th anniversary of what the world would not have to do .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished , I haven &apos;t finished .
And one of the important things is that I learned a lot in the course of this vicious process , which was that Google , for the last year , had murdered me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I &apos;m still the world &apos;s greatest philanthropy entrepreneur , the first African who has access to it , and one thing that surprised me , however , is why I didn &apos;t want to go blab for it . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , interestingly , I &apos;m going to share some of these results with you today , and I &apos;m also rather surprised to know what the key ingredients are for success , which is actually why we get to the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are a fantastic way to create a better place in the world .
If you select a group of people with the desire to equality and to organize them , at the beginning , you will reach out to all the human abilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if the original organizations are so good , why is most of the failure ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success in the beginning .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , chasing out a lot of my design thoughts and misconceptions that sort of led me to some of the businesses in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was beginning to start different businesses at 12 years of age , from New Year &apos;s Eve to kindergarten to school when I was making solar systems , then to college , when I was making radio .
I graduated from school , I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , India started in Libya , and in the last 20 years we &apos;ve run over 100 companies to do a lot of things , and huge things .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to give theorists the most compelling reason for the success of an organization or the most successful reason of failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
And so that &apos;s why I put my company in the name of &quot; &quot; ideas Live , &quot; &quot; the very old moment that you feel about something you think .
Through considering , I thought perhaps the team , the role model , or the ability to be injured , has more important factors .
I never thought there was going to be a TEDster , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s a project , until I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It is critical to the ability to accommodate a team from head to toe .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought that maybe team was the most important thing .
So I started to look at market models .
Is the organization clear about income distribution ?
But with this , I thought that it was the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Perhaps that &apos;s the most important thing ?
Sure . It &apos;s time , right ?
Did the idea come very quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s slow , so you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or too late , and already there &apos;s a lot of anxiety ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of respect for these five key ingredients in a lot of places .
And the idea was taken out of 100 Libya companies , and over 100 of them were outside to try and find a scientific result .
So first of all , these new Libra companies , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all sold for billions of dollars .
And the bottom five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we were very hopeful , but not successful .
And so I tried to inculcate all the characteristics , like I think , these companies had made a breakthrough .
And so in the businesses outside Libya , I started seeing strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
Not a bad return on bad companies , and sometimes it was a market model , but they could not succeed .
I tried to know , but it had the highest impact on all of these companies and the success and the failure , and it shocked me .
The first was the choice of time .
Right now , 42 percent of the time is in the difference between success and failure .
The team and the organization are on the other hand , and then the idea , being different , being different , remoter , is actually number three .
But it &apos;s actually not true , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was shocked to learn that belief is not the most important thing .
Sometimes it matters a lot more when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the market model and investment is what I understand .
I think the market model is really hard because you can start without a market mechanism , and then you put in a market mechanism .
And even investing , if it was low-capital , but now it &apos;s increasing , particularly since today , investing is incredibly easy .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these nations .
Take the big Airbnb success that everybody already knows .
Many of the investors , they &apos;ve noticed , because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to give you a piece of your home for a tickler ? &quot;
Well , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of grass is that the best market mechanism , the workforce , is driven by the right time .
He faced a market mechanism in the days when people needed additional support , and he was able to help people react to a cash incentive to get into their house .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber comes in , the best company , the best market model , the best thinkers .
But , time was everything right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders were also aspiring for additional income ; this was absolutely critical .
Some things , like Citysearch , were there when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 at TED , was around the time when companies wanted to give companies more control .
We thought the idea was great , but really , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online enterprise .
We were so excited to do it — so with enough employees and a wonderful business model , working with some of the leading thinkers at the Hole in the Wall .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband network was very , very small .
The online video was so difficult , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your broker and what to do , and eventually this company did their thing in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem with the cockroach problem and over 50 percent of broadband in the U.S. , it was YouTube at the best time .
Great , good time .
As it turns out , YouTube , when it started , was not a market model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was a wonderful time .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really critical .
Idea is critical .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to value time is to see if they &apos;re really ready for your wedding .
And the really unbelievable thing is , what these results are not that they &apos;re made of , because if you like something , you should stay in the future , but you have to work with it for a very reliable time .
So as we said before , startups can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help you with the rise of your success , and then it won &apos;t be the same in some of the best places in the world .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 on September 2016 we saw the biggest data sharp &#93; &#91; Fund success deals with rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; lack of money into small companies &#93; &#91; What does it mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Rabbit of Galapagos to diagnose the Purdue Purdue . &#93; &#91; Regenerative Rabbit was the center of this week by the Against Women &apos;s Platform for Discover@@
And also , most of the cases that these things had poked out was some of the slums and some of the slums .
We get to know the inner stories of the churches , the bankers and the churches who come in and they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a grammar company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can look at transdermal text messages , you can see a way of doing it , how do you complete things .
The impact has just started to be apparent .
The head of the assassination of East Linds has been lost .
We also heard about the poor infrastructure of the poor countries under the labor agencies .
The revenge of the two billion dollars accumulates to the main building block of the Royal Academy of Divine , his childhood friend , who &apos;s a popular system .
And a lot of rich people are going to be infected and , in all those kinds of stories , tend to be more secret filters than are going to be homeless .
Now this seems like a magic story , or Huxley &apos;s revenge story , which I had .
What should we get out of it ?
But the truth is that grammar and power put people in place with their money and the fact that they shouldn &apos;t be giving it a touch , which means that weaker things like markets do less for health and education .
And the effect of that is on all of us .
My organization for Galapagos Venture , it &apos;s amazing .
Global media and political leaders are talking about how people have shared their influence in weapons companies that talk about our decades .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these companies work .
I think it &apos;s like little girls .
You can start a company with a second company , a second company inside , which is pretty much impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind this gift .
It &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s happening to companies that are communicating and journalistic , schooling and what &apos;s happening .
I think that &apos;s what &apos;s really interesting here in the United States .
Perhaps the reason America &apos;s most famous teacher doesn &apos;t have to be in the hospital .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are poor people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in organizations .
And this is because the way we look at areas , there &apos;s a few parks in the U.S.
I think if we look at the discoveries of Kevin Leader or Dallel Viewers or Huxley or the Nobel Prize , those of you who are connected to America .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give them much information , they need less information to get you into a company than at the Library Card .
This kind of information is thrown away by the students in the U.S.
Nine billion dollars of capital is released by everyone .
This kind of approach affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to see what this problem looks like .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we took a contract and we sent it to 13 private companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transfer to the homeless in the United States , a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The crucial thing was that all of the villages had to give a guess as to how to move their mind .
These were all early meetings , and nobody for a bank , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone , but this disrupted the system .
And it &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about the individual voice that talked about in our hidden enthusiasm about quotation and revenge .
It &apos;s not only about a senior politician who &apos;s found in the hospital .
This is the way the system works , the tactics , the communication , stability and insurgency .
And in order to do that , we have to change the game .
We &apos;re going to have to change the game principle so that this type of thing can be hard to do .
It may be ironic , such as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
So in the last few years , we &apos;ve been stepping up on cleaning where the potential of a company is .
Now , this problem has been put on political paradox , but the British President Defense Department of Divine at 8 o &apos;clock in the winter of 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been building the E.U. at the core of the Company , which is actually the country , or is controlling it .
The thing is , HIV is behind it .
Communication on a planet of rational law is in the center and the Senate , whose development we didn &apos;t want to have as much progress , so we were 15 .
We want to see inventions , time-lapse companies , bigger sections , that were used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in Galapagos , Venture .
Civic leaders should reach the very best known , the very best known , behind the selfish leader .
You know , they make a voice , and it &apos;s not nice for a venture like this , we do .
Politicians need to address this problem , and to lobby for legislative change in access to information .
And we can all collectively erase the privacy sections which are responsible for the cutting and the calling .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
Once upon a time , it is said that Lux , your inventor , has made such a fuss in the last few years that they have so much of the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , could it be true ?
That &apos;s a little bit of a query — isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing how bad the process is to get a small group of people to publish a little bit of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : What &apos;s that like ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you maintain their privacy ?
Julie Singer : There it is . I can say it to you — in the right sense , public services . And we have so many ways to get this information to us .
Therefore , we use a lot of high-speed storage to transmit materials from one place to the Internet , to send them to other places , to clear away the legislative blocks , such as Sweden and Bollywood .
We take data , we get it through regular DDDs , through Ramadan , through whatever , you run it through regular news organizations , put it out — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about mass media , and then you &apos;re protecting yourself against the illegal logic and political officials .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the document is real , but you actually never know what the tools are .
Julie Singer : It &apos;s true , there &apos;s a time when we &apos;re going to know it , and if we &apos;re going to get to a stage , we just take skin and we dismiss the information .
( Cheers ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s money , and I &apos;m asking you what the code is called the TEDTalk . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you invented a few years ago .
If we can see it up .
So a few years ago , that was the story of Kenya .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened then ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a report .
It was an FBI report done by the Kenyan government in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government survived there for 18 years , Daniel Arppi .
He was a nurse in Kenya .
And when it comes to the power of a pocket — these seemingly trivial powers that were trying to decipher how to write , they put 20 million dollars into this report , and on one more report .
And then the government sat down and they used it for their political participation , which was the poorest man — now is the richest man in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ of Kenya .
And that was taken in 2007 , and we were able to achieve the success of the elections , first of September 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days later to reach the new president , Kabul decided to volunteer for the person who was injured , Donnell Amusing , so he could become a report card in the heart of a hospital .
Chris Anderson : And so — I mean , to summarize , I just want to say — this is something that was spread in Kenya , not from the perspective , but from the perspective , and it changed the product of your choice .
Julie Sangin : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafi , and then it was distributed across all the major countries in Kenya , in the news of Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he relieved , a few days later , the Kenyan press relief that they could talk about it .
And that blog was on the TV 20 days of pregnancy , and it changed the equation of 10 percent of the women , according to an online gender report in Kenya , and it changed the result of that .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your vision really changed the world ?
Julie Sangin : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re showing a little bit of a leather video of a couple of seats .
This sequence is long , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-speed video .
RD : ... bitterness , when you &apos;ve reached them , by the way , two .
I found , oh , there are four things with them .
The way is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen &apos;s running .
When they &apos;re on your sign , tell me . Get on with it .
Hi .
Glass !
( Singing ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Singing ) Galen is running .
However , SH — two , six , jihad master — two .
We should now , we have time !
OK , now we killed eight men .
We &apos;re looking at two vehicles , and we &apos;re still carrying around cells .
Ramadan , they &apos;re on my sign .
Two six , it &apos;s two , we &apos;re on the grass .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God beat you , Hillel . Okay . Well , I beat you .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julie Sung : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We &apos;ve done some more research with two people without it .
It was the first of three times that it happened .
CA : So 11 people showed up in this case , right ?
Julie Singer : Yes ! Two employees of the readers , two small children were killed .
Together , 18 to 26 people died .
CA : And after his execution , he finished .
What was the main reason for this disease , you know , which was , you know , why ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see herself with a deep lack of power .
There &apos;s some people in the street , and then they go down a kilometer away , and they start filling out 30 miles of electricity just starts pouring in — anyone here — and they &apos;re getting killed by these kids .
There were two journalists who were no longer oppressed , because they were willing to do this .
CA : Well , the U.S. State Department got reported by Brad Mining , and it &apos;s said that he announced in Chester Rumi that he assigned this video to you , 280,000 and stupidly American documents .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Sung : So we decided to accept the doctrines .
The guess was this : Five days ago , they received over 150,000 documents and over 50 .
But we &apos;ve gone back and forth to give them a document for Ramadan and an American safety family , but it doesn &apos;t correlate .
I mean , I used to go to that safari house .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of applications to run the U.S. safe house ...
Julie Singer : We &apos;ll follow them . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do it ? ) JF : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julie Sung : Because things like this show that actually , what are the states of Arab states , really pushing human rights into these governments .
If you look at hidden documents like this , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Just kidding it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philanthropy ?
Why should you open up blind information ?
Julie Singer : Yes , the question is how important information is in the world , what data can be .
There &apos;s a lot of information .
They &apos;re using data to keep the funding high , it &apos;s a good sign that when you have to get the information out , you hope to do something good , because the foundations know it better , and they know about it , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But are there risks for individually or collectively poor societies , where inequality can &apos;t be expected ?
Julie Singer : We didn &apos;t have any doctrines with them .
I mean we have a big impact .
With data , we can extract transdermal information from a very personalized way — the information that &apos;s available to someone else &apos;s .
But there are certain versions of it . For example , your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about the public goods that will come forward and be playing guessful .
CA : OK , so they do it with the intrinsic motivation .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think about the father , the son of a son in the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people really like to hurt other people .
One of the things that consists of this is that an American culture appears to be dead on people .
Which results — but it did lead millions of people all over the world to believe that the U.S. military is a fantastic idea .
While they &apos;re not , my son is not , who is it that you say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Sung : Well , we &apos;ve been asking so many questions like this .
But in the absence of remember , in Iraq , in Afghanistan — people don &apos;t need to watch videos , they see it everyday .
It does not correlate with what they think , and it does not correlate with what they think .
Because they look at it every day .
It will change the frame and attitude that this gives us money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK . So you look at what you &apos;re expecting in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s great .
But isn &apos;t it ridiculous that in order to have that light , do you have to have that kind of openness in your mind ?
Julie Singer : No . I mean , we &apos;re not all different cells .
We don &apos;t have the media that is surrounded by other media .
If they do this , it &apos;ll be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing the same thing that people are ethically committed to making sure that they do this work more and more and more .
CA : I guess , I &apos;ve just , we &apos;ve done what we &apos;ve heard — we &apos;ve brought the visibility out there .
You might also notice that there will be different fears about the lions and the violations .
One is a hero of hope .
Or Huxley .
What is the view of Jerusalem ?
And what about availability ?
Julie Singer : Oh ! Let &apos;s do something about it .
CA : There are great people , Julie , very good .
We have to try and . Let &apos;s show them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t known yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Now , this is a really interesting story , a little old , isn &apos;t it ?
What is this ?
Julie Singer : Here &apos;s an example of what we do nearly every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — in November , there was a massive network of vessels embedded in the bananas , as was happening in Mexico , but not so big .
And we got the report — it was a great blessing about it — which was that , in fact , conservation companies were fighting different kinds of airlines , and they were stepping there and staring at it .
And they had some forms of the Village government , things like that .
There was nothing up there . That was a pretty tough job for us .
We couldn &apos;t predict it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we were pretty suspicious that perhaps this company was doing this in a competition .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We certainly don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
And the material is so good , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t make a guess . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that he wrote this , and they wanted to take a breath out . ( Laughter ) And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to take a breath out of it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legal for this ?
Is this real you ? Because they brought us these guys that we see on Scripture , with the name of philanthropy , through DNA .
Hi .
( Applause ) There it is .
It &apos;s our way of validating and judging what the material is , and that &apos;s to try to write and get the letter from these people .
CA : All right . So , have you ever got this information from the inside of the Libya ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re accumulating and mixing things like difficult times .
Our initiative to publish this has become invaluable in a few months , because we &apos;re refining our own bike system because of the vast public waste that we have .
It &apos;s raw .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s been broadcast , more than our capability is broadcast to us because of our growth , and it means that we have a large number of public services that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have as many people who can classify and measure this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , for the purpose of a journalist or a journalist or a journalist ?
Julie Sung : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because with the material that &apos;s dealing with us , we have to rebuild it so that we can get people who have a deep sense of what &apos;s safe , and then less sense of what &apos;s happening .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you go to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julie Singer : Yes , I was in the business of my parents , and then she moves away from the city , so the effect of these two reasons ...
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychiatrist , so it &apos;s just , you know , everybody can do something together to create a mental illness .
Julie Singer : What , the business of movies ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one of the younger guys , and you were kind of on the verge of adoption .
Julie Singer : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist , a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I girl at the time when I was indicted in this crime .
So you need to appreciate the word and appreciate it .
I mean , this is — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only in the state of Russia that your grandmother has access to a bank account .
To do that , this word is no longer as useful as it was before .
CA : Well , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your main value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps an event in your life that has helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in facts .
But base values : good , brilliant , healthy people don &apos;t generate goods ; they prepare them .
And this is the lesson that I learned from my father and some other brilliant , aggressive people who live in my life .
CA : A brilliant and healthy people don &apos;t make fun of producing products ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed man , so that &apos;s not very good for growing things , but somehow — there is another way to react to waste , which is to get nearer to the police , to crime .
And this has been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve just got to say this in the last few years : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you put something up there , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then they tell the newspapers that they eradicate their story .
Instead , they showed you the situation .
You know that kind of thing . So what happened here ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
AIDS is a crisis .
There he was .
The bank had gone down to 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report in July last year .
And the National Taliban had a very controversial event before they were published five minutes ago , as a movie : &quot; The candor came to the desk , and the state of the news reader was , &quot; It never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed up the website , spent a lot of time huddling around , and we were very popular in the Ice Lands , and I went to Ice Lands and talked about this problem .
And the ingredients were there that people shouldn &apos;t have to be the same again , and as a result , the scientists in the South Land , working with some international thinkers , we didn &apos;t break a new kind of Isaiah Linds , so it was a kind of freedom media , a place for the most protected , for the most protected , for the new Apple print , for free .
A country like Ice Land , it &apos;s a nation that &apos;s approached from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the WISER members thought about it perfectly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater polarity , or are we looking at greater power , or is it going to lead to greater power ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to meet the laws of free demand and laws of transparency , globally — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What bits ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because from a small attempt , we can move it to one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems that I &apos;m translating the character of coaches into something called , quote , honor , and all the power for you .
Julie Singer : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like to play and watch .
So I did this , which is a crocodile .
I spent my childhood wandering around the halls of the client , and I used to see them carefully in the kitchen .
When I went to college and I came back home in the early 1990s , I found this .
My team stayed quiet .
And when I looked at it from a very personal point of view , I sort of realized , how do the rest of the world think about it ?
And whenever I &apos;d gone to the churches , I &apos;d seen photos of North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in London , where I &apos;d seen photos of all four creatures being slaughtered down by Nine Fahrenheit — cold , cold , silver and candy .
And I thought that was peculiar , and I was wondering if anyone else had this jar of legs .
And when I got to the top of it , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at these team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To confine the natural world with few elements , there is no unusual human character .
That &apos;s what we did 10,000 years ago when we took out our cities .
If you look at areas 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see them colliding and bumping , you &apos;ll see all the creatures that look like this .
But if you look back to 2,000 years ago , all you would see is four animals : honey , cow , alcohol and yogurt .
It &apos;s also true for the elders .
You &apos;ll notice on New York City &apos;s journeys , 150 years ago , or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see cartoon , puzzle and puzzle .
But if you look at the remoteness of this , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s only four light years away , so the rainbow , the herd , but also the ring .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re heading towards this .
How did that happen to us ?
Shhh .
It &apos;s a brand new problem .
And this is what we &apos;ve been doing for the last 50 years .
World War II came to give us the greatest inspiration to be heroic .
In the middle of the Great War , we put technology to remoteness things like sunlight , polymers and things like that , up the road .
And since the end of the Second War of the Great War , I learned to look beyond the ability of catastrophe to catastrophe .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the cultured food and the sea urban agriculture has gone up , and in the last two years , its birth rate has gone up from macaroni .
Now if you put all the forest and all the forest into this , it will be equal to two Chinese deaths per year .
Using China , for example , is not a one-way street , because China is not only the largest country , it &apos;s also the biggest form of enterprise .
So now we turn to our four choices .
The first is the biggest user of sea meat in the United States and the West .
Gaddafi is a terrible response .
Only one founded forest lagoon will kill five , 10 , or 15 pounds of forest cats .
Now , the Indus script also has an unbelievable level of honor .
In a study done in Dutch University , it showed that reading gases from house to house is actually ineffective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That in areas that live in rural areas , those are the wars of Mongolia .
Take a look at these beautiful girls .
They clean the Earth &apos;s atmosphere with their place to protect the beaches and the cleaning and the waste from their neighborhood , all sorts of important things to the environment .
Well , that &apos;s what happened with the Civil War of Pennsylvania .
We &apos;ve lost 30 or 40 years , millions of superheroes .
There &apos;s a second action going on here , called &quot; &quot; Cholera of the movie market , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; catwalking in the grass . &quot; &quot; So you see something on the street just now that &apos;s very controversial .
Today , what &apos;s happening is that the leather reflex is heavy , but with it , with so much more mosquitos , it causes the other mosquitos to fit in to eat .
And a lot of the time that these seals are used for stamping clay tags that are named after the Reddit , they &apos;re the mosquito that we &apos;d like to see on the Reddit , which means that the ecosystem is opening and setting itself up .
Then we have the second big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
The tone is to look at very large areas for organization as well .
Our own area , as scientists call it , is called the ICCAT , for electronic healing .
And the great reading for all of this , of course , was the great reading .
We can do fun , but it &apos;s not good enough for the Trojan print .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s warm .
It can take up more than 40 miles per hour , and it can take up more than 20 degrees of heat from its environment .
So almost all the funds for this petition are ending up .
The frame is shaped with the blood vessels , which is not very fast .
This is the best for protein .
But those forest creatures that go from 40 miles per hour are not even able to stay in the form .
There &apos;s a lot of friction , needless to say , that &apos;s a terrible thing .
This is my own political connectome .
The connectome was outside of the forest .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every dot has to be a document .
In the politics of Connect , there are over 3,000 of them .
First of all , I say there &apos;s a lot of people in the connectome . ( Laughter ) If someone takes the power of a connectome , I think we can really improve the world .
And everywhere , these are the rockets that disappear from reaching out to these children .
As a result , we have a successful breakthrough for the pharmacy and the peace process .
When the shelter started , Sydney was paid for six pounds of desalination brine to build one .
But now it &apos;s much better .
Now , one thing that happens in return is slightly wrong , because if you look at the footprint , they drop like a butterfly on a footprint .
Now , the FedEx is trained as bait .
For those that don &apos;t say , halal and halal are a terrible thing to do .
But there &apos;s also the whole market mechanism in terms of replacing the Purdue chicken model .
This is a system that is producing cooker , which is a gas that &apos;s playing the Earth .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent per year .
Despite the idea that , for the monkey to get to the market , we &apos;re actually spending a lot less money , but then we &apos;re getting a lot of money .
Not only do we grow leather but we also grow crops and vegetables .
We have what &apos;s left , what &apos;s open , and what &apos;s new , what &apos;s open .
Because on top of that , the blood and hands and so on begin to pay the bills .
I &apos;m also rather surprised , because what he did , and what he did was he opened the kitchen .
India was first or a pier . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking to about 30 million tons of forest creatures that are taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third piece of China , or the number of people in the U.S. , who get out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia actually started as a liar .
And it started to look like a local entrepreneur who had seen that the day ahead of the community could never be on the market downwards .
She goes to the head of the line and says , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
For those that don &apos;t know , even for the Sunitha , there was evidence that Hello could not win .
So he made his own lift song .
Unfortunately , the pension was in 30 seconds .
He wanted to be a sender in 25 centuries , so he brought in the eighth key .
For the most part , the Philippines of Philadelphia is the largest piece of art in the United States , 23 billion pounds of leather from the sea every year .
If we stop the police , maybe the alternative would be tripled .
Twenty years ago , you didn &apos;t know Taliban .
This plate change the protein from animal protein in a very dynamic way , and this is a killer for the third world .
Actually , this is a really clever solution that &apos;s coming out of an individual in nine months .
The problem is , if you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a refrigerator .
It &apos;s not limited to the PCs and the DDs that we think will live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean this poor , happy clip .
That &apos;s a large sample of about 30 million tons .
One possibility which ecologists have asked is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up for peace ?
There are reasons for that .
They have a wonderful childhood of honor in the market , which is a typical part of development against lying , and the influence at the very top of the Indus Valley .
This is Omidyar 3 , EPA and DDI .
So here &apos;s his potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying you a few dollars , pay you a pound or a FedEx or a FedEx or a FedEx or a FedEx or a FedEx or a FedEx or a FedEx ?
The second key ingredient , which is really interesting , is hominem attacks .
They have much more EPACs and ADHD .
The Indus calculus has a profound impact .
The Indus civilization does not belong to just three parts of the meat closer to the market .
Actually , it &apos;s October 3 , which doesn &apos;t come from the kitchen .
sea level rises by three , so it just collects them .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algebra , the reason we have this is because of the use of Facebook and the Internet .
Over the past 20 years , deaths have been born with 400 deaths , which are a very big killer of sea life .
Now , as you might imagine with a computer , in all these different kinds of ways , proteins and , more than three , are highly effective signs .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And finally , the puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a facility that can provide harmless proteins to us .
This creature should be a greenhouse , a fast-growing and evolved environment will support its own ability to grow leather in its way , and it should be the EPA , DHA , OMG3 and the Fab East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been replicating these topics for 15 years .
Whenever I do this , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do it .
But try not .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
And if we did that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million in the sea .
I mean , this is all being done .
We want to think differently about what we don &apos;t need .
But if we did something , the problem would be a little crazy .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was in a big way to reach the brain , because I have a brother who &apos;s a disease deficit in ADHD .
So as a scientist , I wanted to understand , how do I connect my dreams from my reality and create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what is it that they do not combine their dreams with the public and the public realities and their actions .
So I spent my life studying serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked at the President Francesca Bank at the University of Harvard Media .
And so what &apos;s the problem with looking at the biological surface of these people &apos;s brains that are generally thought about as being compared to the brain of people who are living in conditions like Scottish , or Purdue Purdue , is that , in fact , we were trying to make a map of the brain &apos;s molecular matrix , which cells are sending the message , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the problem with , &quot; &quot; and how much of
So I had a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this kind of research in the day , but on a Saturday and weekend at night , I was filling out the NAMI trip in a hotel , just like a NAMI trip .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I got to know that I met myself with an intelligent designer .
The left side of my brain was a nine strokes .
And for the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
Eventually , I was able to write to stay still in the morning and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you have ever looked at the same brain , there are two parts of the brain that are very , very different from each other .
I created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the left part of the brain , the left part of the brain , and the right arm is touched and it &apos;s going to stay in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are very , very different .
So those of you who think about computers , on the right part of our brain , works like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain works like a solar processor .
Those two pieces are each other sending messages to each other through the reverse body , calling for 300 volunteers .
But they &apos;re also identical to the two .
Because they understand information in different ways that the knowledge of each part has to totally different knowledge about things , and you allow them to tell me that their identities are so different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . Compassion .
SOC : Yes , it &apos;s gone .
( Laughter ) The evidence from our brain is only recently thought about this .
Here , at this point in time , we &apos;re thinking about parts of our brain that are thinking about physiologically , thinking about parts of our body .
Information is shaped down in the shape of power , and it is shaped down in the body by our nervous system , and then it is shaped down in the form of a great Islamic class , which , at the moment , tells us how to feel and how to feel in the mind , and how to read .
I am an energy gear that &apos;s connected from its surrounding energy through the right part of the brain .
We are the brainwashes of energy that are connected to one another through the right-hand part of the brain , beginning to feel like a human family .
And at this point in time , we are brothers and sisters on this planet who are responsible for making the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
On the left of our brain , we think scientifically and scientifically .
The left side of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is told that we take the greatest Islamic Olympics of our current day and we begin to collect analyses of it and then we begin to look at metrics .
And it also organizes and facilitates this information that is associated with all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past and the possibilities of the future , which is to justify the impact on our beliefs .
The left-hand part of our brain is thought of as being in language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that touches the world and our inner world with us .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me , you have to remember to go home and buy them .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a very awareness of me creating a book that reminds me where to grab the ball .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; I am ! I am ! &quot;
And as my left brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I am isolated .
I &apos;m the only person who &apos;s ever deceived from well-being around me and from you .
That same part of my brain , that morning , happened first in the Philippines .
On the morning of judgment , my left eye on the back of my eyes , a huge wound of pain .
It was all sorts of pain from the side of a screen .
It hurts me , it hurts me , it leaves me .
He turns and knocks again .
To me , it was an unusual thing that I had never experienced pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I put on my career path , which is a membrane-filtration machine .
Now , I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , because I feel like I &apos;m a fan of an initial person who &apos;s moved to Donna .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; That is such an anomaly , &quot; &quot; and then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel such an anomaly , poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems that the way I had changed my mind is that I &apos;m a general awareness of who is going through this experience that is going to be driven by this machine , but now I was a hidden and mysterious place
And this was all very strange and poor , and I had an increased heart rate .
So I got out of the machine , and I started to walk in the room , and I realized that everything was going on in my body .
And everybody has a very , very rigid and wonderful idea .
I have no correlation in my speed , and I think there &apos;s a correlation in the way I look , so it &apos;s only in the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my sewery house ready to go underneath the water , and I &apos;m actually experiencing a paradise in my body .
I made a voice that said , &quot; &quot; My daughter has to touch you now .
Oh , my foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing , I &apos;m holding a wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I could no longer redefine my body &apos;s waste .
I can &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to end because my hand and my hand are put off with atoms and molecules and molecules .
If I was to understand something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And in that moment , the whole thing on the left of my brain was very quiet .
It &apos;s just like someone has made a voice with a motor control .
A breath .
Once upon a time , I discovered a surprise in the uncertainties of my brain .
But then immediately , I suddenly found energy in that great space station that surrounded me .
And since I could no longer understand the boundaries of my body , I felt really superior , I felt really powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then one of the first things that got to the left of my brain and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re in trouble . &quot;
We &apos;d like to help you , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really feeling under threat . ( Laughter ) Looks like I &apos;m really in trouble , but I came back immediately in the same consciousness that I &apos;m calling for a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Take a look at what would be beautiful where you are completely involved in this tiny brain that is blowing you away from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the vernacular where my job is and where the whole thing is going on .
I felt a lot of shame in my body .
And look , all of your relationships that are from the outside world , and there &apos;s some stress going on .
And I felt a sense of peace and mercy .
And measure what it would look like if you went back to sleep at 37 years of age with the expression that you showed up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I was just raised as a welder .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left side of my brain and said , &quot; Oh , by the way , two . &quot;
We need some help , and I think I should help me be proud of this , so I went away from a poor home and I had a machine gun department , and right now I &apos;m putting myself in my office and I &apos;m thinking , can I go get a car ? &quot; &quot; And this moment my mother has been completely broken .
It was then that it occurred to me that my God is holding me and the only thing that my mind tells me is how magnificent this thing is .
( Laughter ) What &apos;s crazy !
Some brain researchers are going to have this opportunity to recall that they can awake their own brains and that they go in . ( Laughter ) Then one day came to my mind . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very popular woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to frame . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop acting as a philanthropy industry , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I have to call out to help . I have to call out . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember working . So I remember I had a workshop , and I remember I had a workshop on my phone number .
And so I go into my bedroom and I &apos;m going to spend about three inches of motorcycles .
And I look at the top of the card as I look out of my brain &apos;s eyes and I see what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card I don &apos;t know , because I don &apos;t have to look at any of the other places .
And the drop-in is supposed to be followed by the maps of paper and the symbols , and I wasn &apos;t reading anything .
And so I started waiting for what I call the bureaucratic administration .
And in that moment , the public was repeating itself from the fact that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to decrease the slide in just one inch .
And in that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the police was on the left .
I don &apos;t know the number . I haven &apos;t come to understand the phone , but I have no option .
So I take the phone and I plug it in .
I picked up a business card and I put it there , and now I &apos;m seeing the little girls who are following the cards on the phone as they look at the phone .
But then I picked myself up to my own elder when I came back , I didn &apos;t remember putting that number in .
So I took my fucking arm like a giant elephant and stuck it on the sides of the other hand and commissioned them to come back to the normal truth , so you could tell me that I had just arrived in a crocodile before , and I heard that there was a crocodile in the phone number one of my nanny who picked up the phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; (
And so I &apos;m saying to her , in my brains , &quot; I &apos;m speaking , I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like this , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , my god , I &apos;m speaking like a Gaddafi-driver . &quot; &quot; So it occurred to me that I didn &apos;t know that I could spot a language and I didn &apos;t understand language until I tried it .
He understood that I needed help and he needed help .
Shortly after that , all four orphans were in a hospital , all across the Boston Massacre , Hospital .
I walked down and I looked like children of a tiny Pat .
Just like the one in which the rest of my herd had fallen out of the bank , I pulled the energy out and I realized just how hurry I was .
And it occurred to me that now I &apos;m not living my life .
Or perhaps my doctor has saved me and offers me a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I finished , I was shocked to learn that I still survive .
When I felt really in shock of my soul , then I said life to God .
Now , my brain has been inspired by two contradictions between reality .
I had started to realize the emotional system in those days which it was only through pain .
Like the fire in the forest , my brains were so close and the ears were so strong that I could barely hear a voice or a voice coming from the forest , and I was just peddling a space of irrelevance .
Because I wasn &apos;t able to diagnose my body in the mirror , so I felt really superior and wide , like the person who got rid of my whiskey .
And my spirit has been unleashed , like a great joke running through the sea of rain .
Great . Neurons .
I &apos;ve developed qualities that are good for me .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I could have my greatest appreciation of the being able to learn from the inside of a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been incarcerated .
And if I have been inspired by the neurons , and I still live since then , whatever life is capable of getting heroes , and I have seen a world that is filled with beauty , fraternity , compassion and love , people who know can feel this quality at any time .
And they can be chosen to pass on and off because the truth is that when they want to take their way to the left side of their brain , they seek this universal quality .
And then I realized how this experiment could be a gift of what it was like to be a chef in cigarettes who taught me to live my life .
And it motivated me to be healthy .
Eventually , after a period of half-heartedness , the soul pieces of blood flow from my brain failed to shrink the same blood vessels as the brain &apos;s respiratory system .
I &apos;m here with my mom , who &apos;s a real fan of my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we then ?
We are the real power of life , talent and two extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world where we are and what we want to be .
There &apos;s a place where I can step into the right part of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , the power of life .
Fifty beautiful cells , the ECM is made up of biological cells , one that is all in them .
Or I can choose to step back to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a trivial way .
Wait a minute . Wait a minute .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
Inside me is we are .
What would you choose ?
What would you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right hemispheres of the brain conducting electricity , the more we put peace in this world and the more rapid our planet is .
And I thought that was worth reading .
Thank you .

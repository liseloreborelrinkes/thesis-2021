Good morning !
Are you people there ?
They took my name to the Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the Tiger in Arabic ?
No ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young century ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating food .
So I asked the question : Do you have a free food in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , and thought he must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minu &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minu . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Blah said .
He was talking to me three men , as he was telling me , &quot; If this girl was the last girl in the world , I will not see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl with accuracy and language .
How can they speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
It got me angry .
Sure enough .
What is it that I &apos;m privileged to speak my own country ?
Where does this happen ?
How did we get here ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there &apos;s a lot of people like me , who reach a point in their lives where they basically leave out everything that &apos;s inside them , just because they can say they like it and they &apos;re terrible .
Should I bring all my culture , my ideas , my mind and my dreams ?
We may have the most important warriors in children &apos;s stories .
Do they have to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
How does that make sense ?
Despite that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice for the Russians as well as the Russians did for me .
The Arabic does not represent the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use in the workplace that we find when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use in the previous TED .
If we do that , they will outcaste us .
So where can I explain it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of mother .
Research says that you have to translate your mother tongue into other languages .
In other languages , the primary attributes of the mother tongue are the language .
How ?
Jaian Galen , when he first started writing , explained Arabic .
All his imaginations , imaginations and philosophy were inspired by this little girl in the village where she grew up , felt a special joy , felt a special voice , and thought about it .
When they started writing in English , they had enough materials .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their essays in English , you feel the same joy , the same feeling .
You can imagine that these are also in English , the little girl who lives in the village , living in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no engineer can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are emerging .
Germany , France , Japan and China are all under control .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the wall , they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset we haven &apos;t yet gotten , and we want to get to this developing world .
They were the countries that were just like us in an age , but decided to try to grow up , to research , to reach those countries , such as Tiger , entrepreneurs , they spoke their own language as they were climbing stairs , as they were .
They kept it close to themselves .
Because if you take Turkey or Kaki and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these offices , non-obvious offices , like we are more time .
So to create new inventions and innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Isaac , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you of ?
What would you find ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a symbol of the very fabric of our lives , and the vocabulary that separates us from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Religion , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you is going to create a special tree in your brain . There are special emotions for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to what we think , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What about our mind ?
How would you say that you didn &apos;t understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you taken the lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about insurance .
It &apos;s that these effects remind us of a special thing .
I have a friend who spoke French who spoke from a French .
I was asking this question .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his wife and translate it one night to try to translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; immigrant . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An old lady called her &quot; &quot; immigrant , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand her .
He was thinking , how could someone really show up ?
Do they want to self-destruct ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us realize that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought was different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; She , she listens to me on Friday , and one night , I tried to translate for her to feel what I feel when I hear the Fridays . &quot; &quot; Billy woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I held her hand up and you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And SM : And because you are me , I put my hands up and you leave . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
It translates . It allows me to show you .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We changed it for a society , and we started the Arabic language campaign .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Please raise the heat , pay it off . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language language minister announced a saying , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do that because , you know , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody says to me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be rational in the way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives change .
It &apos;s the same as ours and the same as ours .
So this says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; Put the right sign .
It &apos;s very simple but efficient .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of hills on Earth .
You see , outside , there &apos;s an example , of a landscape in which the letter black and white is at the bottom , along with the translation , &quot; Kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Don &apos;t actually kill your language .
We really should not kill our language .
If we kill our language , we have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s too expensive to have the opportunity to create novel and religion .
After this , we pasted an Arab letter for girls and girls .
Kole models of girls and girls .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; chocolate &quot; &quot; in my hand . &quot; &quot; They want to confirm how much they want to do , but I have to translate that word that &apos;s so good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t teach ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be convinced that we &apos;re not going to let anyone grow up or decide that the language is right at us , putting pressure on us , or fighting our patients and thinking on us .
Our idea needs to be invented .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t redefine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
At this point , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start with that .
They write a notebook or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the Global Goals .
He can repeat the first letter of Arabic .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know this , and we have to be convinced that the solution is there , part of the solution .
In summer , what can you do today ?
Which of you Twitter ?
For Muslims , I reject you , though , my time is gone , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the linguistic script , does not write Arabic .
( Applause ) This is abortion ! This is no language .
You go into a virtual world with a language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need of the language .
Now let me tell you a secret .
A child is raising a language for the first time .
When my daughter &apos;s born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , that &apos;s it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I turned out to my daughter that in the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , Thanks , Mama , &quot; &quot; is not going to say &quot; thank you
And don &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of humiliation . ( Applause )
I speak a little English lesson to say that it reminds us that we have no option , that we have no option , that we have no option , that we have no option but to follow my people , until you see me , we have no option with bananas , and I have this generation of inequality that does not remind us of our generation until they &apos;re known to celebrate cultures , as part of
( Applause )
I love chocolate dots .
In college , my primary attorney was Gornett , which meant I had to write a lot of articles .
Now , when a normal person writes something , this approach works .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to slow down the start of the exercise , but in the first week , you do a lot of work and a lot of work later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be everything , but it &apos;s actually going to get to the top , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens to every religious function .
And then again , there &apos;s a whole new set of pages of research that you do in a year .
And I knew that I had no option for this kind of approach .
It was a huge task .
I plan , I decided I would do something like this .
It &apos;s going to go something like this this this this this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a work , in the middle months , picking up the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to add it to more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
Then there was a funny thing .
A few months ago ?
Come on and go , and I can &apos;t do anything more .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go home , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by , two months went by , two weeks went by .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in the DC , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , and I put 90 pages , I did two roads , two roads — people shouldn &apos;t have to go on two roads — the front page was delaying , spending hundreds of hours , and all that on David Lynne .
I thought , this is it .
A week later , I got a call and he was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk at the paper . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , from now on , that &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
She was very welcome . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My roof applies to six people all the time , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain makes a difference between six people .
To find out , I took a leaf diet , where I scaled up two brains of the same size and the brain of the chest , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look at it carefully and say , there was a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , that &apos;s not very graphic , but look at it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Now both of these brains have had contradictions , but the rest of the human brain is fun to play .
Now what does this mean for a singer ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is the best time to work . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart man will make a decision to make meaningful decisions , but he didn &apos;t like this plan , so he &apos;ll pick up the profile , and he &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Please read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and the techno-headed scandal , because I know it &apos;s just happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we go to the floor , and lo and behold , something new happened in 10 minutes ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube that &apos;s going to start talking about the race in the TED conference , and very soon it &apos;s going to end up watching television on Twitter for Mother &apos;s Day .
( Laughter ) It will take some time for all of those things , so it won &apos;t take any time to do anything else this day .
How about that ? ( Applause ) Now , what &apos;s happening here ?
Now , this is not about the happiness you want .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It recognizes that the future doesn &apos;t have any context , it &apos;s just two things : freedom and excitement .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you know you and you spend your entire life going longer and longer , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to create , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and growing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t gone extinct , the population isn &apos;t too far .
We are an increasing tragedy , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is to figure out what makes us happy .
Sometimes the guards seem to be right to do what is easier and fun to eat , to think or to feel comfortable in times of opportunity .
There &apos;s an image for it .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the Millennium Development Goals .
And for strangers , this contradiction always reveals the end , which spends a lot of time in a short space , a simple and mysterious way that goes beyond the circle .
I call this the Dark Ages .
( Laughter ) The dark matter is the place where strangers are so close together .
This is where employment comes when it &apos;s not supposed to be dominating .
The extra stuff that comes to you in the dark matter is not actually the extra , because it &apos;s not the right thing to do , the space feeling , the fear , the feeling of hatred , and all the characteristics that are in the right place .
The question is , in this case , when the basement goes offline , how do the rest of us get into the blue algae , which is a lesser but more important place ?
It turns out that the Sistine people also have the protection granted , which is keeping it at the right places at the right time — someone called the household .
( Laughter ) Now this house is more popular than that , but when David lines up , it gets scarier or scarier when people are at risk of embarrassment , jobs or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the bee only suffers from that .
Now I had a relationship with it in my life , because six months ago TED people called me and asked me to speak at TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My wish was to join TED in May .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and anger , something else was happening in the brain of conscious decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . Bharat said , &quot; &quot; I do it here . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India at less than 200 feet , we &apos;ll simply do the dummy house when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided to name the Koran .
I opened the web and I had a picture of me holding it .
And who did they get ?
( Laughter ) High-performing homeowner , and in a few seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember being frightened of the homeowner — he &apos;s sitting on a tree !
And finally , and finally , the long-term decision makers spontaneously came together and I could start talking .
Now the homeowner who talks about lessons from all walks of life , like me , would be like someone like me would give two weeks and they wouldn &apos;t be able to write a check , and then wonderfully put together unbelievable components of work , go to sleep and write a letter .
And the three-dimensional finish line is what &apos;s called the Sisters &apos; system .
It &apos;s not very nice , so Lakshine is not practical .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was struck by the implications of it .
I actually got thousands of emails from all over the world and from people , from all kinds of different backgrounds .
They included nurses , builders , engineers , penetrants , and also massively transmitted CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody was telling the story and saying , &quot; I am too confused . &quot;
What surprised me was the number of emails , the number of emails , and the number of emails .
These people were lying in bed writing about how much Susan did in her life , about what she did .
I thought about it , and I said , &quot; &quot; OK ! What if the system is right then ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
Well , it turns out that there are two orders of magnitude .
Today I gave the examples I gave , which talked about , all of their data lines .
And when David lines up , recent effects are dying because the house is falling .
But the system has a second kind of relationship , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any David Lynne .
So if you want a project that you start with , like a few sports or businesses — some kind of arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start cutting your energies in order to stay engaged .
In addition to tasks , there are many other things that don &apos;t even have to do with David Lynne , like staying with his family , doing exercise , remembering your health , thinking about your relationships , telling your relationships as well as being untouchable .
Now , if the only way to do the harvest is to do the harvest , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data lines that you put in place , the homeowner wins .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest effects are that you can &apos;t bear them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of television setup that goes on very , very little to see and talks about less than just sexual death , ambiguous fundamentalism .
You are suffering from shame and information .
And this could be the source of long-term stewardship and litigation .
So I thought that &apos;s why they &apos;re emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the news .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The television teacher sets them up , sometimes in her life .
The upsetting is not that they cannot pursue their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails , and one thing that came out — I think there aren &apos;t six people .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and some of you may have had good relationships with the DDLC , but remember the keys when there &apos;s no digital curve .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the cylinder of life .
Each block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many of the boxes , especially when some of them have been exposed .
I think we all need to get around the candle .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing at work , because there &apos;s no time in every life .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that same house on it , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s faster .
Thank you .

Eight days in the United States and Afghanistan , an eight-day assembly of the United States and an Afghan refugee was moving from a region of Afghanistan to a region of Afghanistan that helped provide an office for the Afghan government to protect an officer from the destruction of Afghanistan so that they could protect an officer from a prison campaign to protect an Afghan refugee campa@@
The military fighters arrived at the point of an incident , and they lived around three corners , and with so many things , they were seen as child laborers , couples , cousins , and they were seen as child laborers , and they were seen as child laborers , and they were raised and killed .
One of the rulers of the eight-year-old children and he and a Spanish doctor were climbing up to a helicopter , and he and a Spanish doctor were climbing up to a helicopter .
What it shows is that the captain and the Homo sapiens define this mysterious piece of metal with which he or she grows .
They put it into the Hole in the Hole in the Wall computers , and then you see what the Cape Sandon might do and what it used to do before they put it back to everyone else .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are very depressing emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why it &apos;s not the way I work with people .
You know , in the garden , you &apos;re given to people who wish to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In the businesses , we give bonuses to people who want to be victimized so that we can benefit .
We have an online computer .
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just better people .
That &apos;s why they hop across the ocean .
These are the best people who are left behind by the imagination of services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so each and every one of us has the capacity to engage and do this , and increase the capacity to do it in others .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of meeting with some of these people , and we said yesterday , I wish I had the ultimate privilege of meeting some of these people , and we said yesterday , Jesus , who held their energies and their knowledge to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are not important .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they &apos;re emotions , not theirs .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Stand me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It &apos;s not possible that I give two people the chance to cooperate and do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does this excitement come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to paper , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , these are all factors that are really touching us .
Nothing personal .
Whether it &apos;s memory that &apos;s reduced the amount of resources , whether it &apos;s a long-term TEDster , it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan , all of this together , to reduce our lifespan .
And therefore we were ready in the form of social animals where we gathered and gathered together to do what I call a piece of faith , as in a tribe where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was fun and collaborative .
It has independent benefits .
That means I can go to sleep at night and I can browse and see some of the risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t trust each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t trust you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The new remoteness is exactly the same .
This world is full of risks that are trying to make our lives harder or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
It could be a society that is too expensive for the stock market to have an uncertain situation .
It could be a new technology that pulls your commercial bread away at night , and it could be a new technology that pulls your commercial bread away at night .
Or you can have a fight that sometimes tries to fight you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but at least it drives up your risks and tries to take your businesses to drink you , it drives up your risks and tries to take your businesses to drink you out .
We don &apos;t have any values on these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the action is , because that &apos;s the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect and save the lives of the people in his organization that are contributing to protecting and saving the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to assess their own quiet and precious outcomes so that people can feel and feel secure and feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , that &apos;s where things happen .
I was on an ongoing trip , and I realized that when a trip had tried to climb up to the mountain before it had been launched and I saw the staff on the front door to see the people in front of the room like he passed the law as he was crime .
One of the first things I tried to walk on was this : One of the first things I tried to walk on was this one .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep wrestling like a windmill ?
Why can &apos;t you sing with us human beings like us ? &quot; &quot; And from then on , he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we like to travel to the West Airlines is not because they hold the Lassa people better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up their leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and strength protecting ourselves from one another , and that makes organization worse .
What a great leader can do is to give him the most close example of what a good parent is like to be a good parent and give him the best example of how to become a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What makes us a good parent ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our children opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , to give them more credit so that we can do for themselves , so that they can grow and have more credit for what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and records , when they need it , they want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and records , when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to have dignity and function so that they can achieve more achievements that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve more advances than ever imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , is the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump in New York City , saying that if you have a tough time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charlie lost practical practice in prostitution , and Charlie lost practice in prostitution .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get to work on the basis of the work problem .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will mentor you and help you , much like we would for our own children who go to school to get C-Grand .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , the only reason so many people are particularly frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , is because there are so many people who are very frustrated and angry and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs who are unequally motivated and motivated .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the basic principle of dignity .
They have grown a denser society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones to their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones as loved ones for their loved ones , as opposed to the fact that they &apos;ve enslaved their loved ones , as opposed to the fact that they &apos;ve enslaved their loved ones because of their loved ones .
This is what we assume , not data .
Can anyone guess why the employee was putting $ 150 million bills ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problem with it ? Absolutely not .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Instead , they &apos;ll give people the skin data to save , but they &apos;ll give people the skin data to save .
In the Bush administration , we run a mining company in the Bush administration for a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who volunteered the big business , and they lost 30 percent of their roads overnight .
Now this is a huge problem in a large mining company , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their own product overnight .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , so many of the companies that have now come together and do a sudden task .
And Bob responded .
You see , the Bombay doesn &apos;t trust the plant .
Instead , babies believe in cheating , and it &apos;s much more difficult to reduce heart attacks and reduce heart attacks than it is to reduce heart attacks .
And then they developed a personal project .
That every job , from CEO to CEO , needs to be in the small four-week vacation .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob explained the program , he maintains so much .
He said that it &apos;s better than all of us to pick up a tiny spectrum , because some of us have taken a lot more money and put a lot more money into it .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as people might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody expected , people started trading off each other .
The ones who were more successful did business with less success .
So some had to charge five shoes in order to get someone to sign three shoes .
Knowledge is an extreme , not a contradiction .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing , and I know a lot of people who are very good at organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateur warriors , and we do what they say , because we get paid , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of organizations who don &apos;t have the authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the full attention of the person on the left , and they have had the full attention of the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the physics that had been out in the theater and how the physicists used to eat food in the honey and prepare it to their fellows and don &apos;t save anything for it .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his dinner so he could eat it because it was this .
We call them leaders to start .
We call them leaders because they risk someone else first , we call them leaders because they risk someone else first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that our leaders can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that our people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them and make them feel better , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people can protect us .
They &apos;ll give us their own blood and blood and blood so they &apos;ll see their dream as reality , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your blood and your blood to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they also do this for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t this organization that we &apos;re all going to like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to do everything ? &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to do things ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up named Motetema in a small story of the Limpopo , which is consistent with Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the supply of water and water is so unbelievable , such as in moments , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up at a time when I was 17 years old , I was staying in the dark with my friends in the winter .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was dozing off in the dark , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches on the skin and doesn &apos;t make you cry ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I just bought this one . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I found some amazing statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty of them are in four million Africans , and there are only some in South Africa .
Different diseases fall into the environment known as the most dangerous tragedy .
The reason the tragedy in the eyes is that there &apos;s an inflammation that &apos;s caused by a higher degeneration of the tragedy that you can deal with directly .
This disease kills eight million people every year on a regular basis , and one of the biggest obstacles you have to solve from the tragedy : no choice , no plants , no engineering .
After watching these thoughtful statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and not just doing it , but I &apos;m doing it at least because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I got an email from my brother , 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a web broadband , I went to Google and did some research on Wikipedia ,
And I looked at this as a special problem in the box .
So the Mohammed said , &quot; &quot; Well , our formula is ready .
Now we need to be careful with this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses writing my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; No more gold ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first email exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need the skin .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and in limited resources , which I had , the Millennium Development Goals brought in a few new people , did this additional job , and now we have a full-scale model , which is ready for the market , but now has access to the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They only buy what they need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a ticket in Alex . They buy a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how it costs more .
So we did DryBath in these creative milestones .
You just have to put it in between and leave it out .
And the cool thing is , there &apos;s a simple replacement of a knee in five corners .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about the consumption of products .
We even want DryBath &apos;s expecting kids to get there . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water on the average , whenever they leave the garbage and we could save two houses for children , two houses , more than two houses for school , two houses for more than two houses for children .
After seeing these global impacts , we &apos;ve taken it out of our main values of goods , health and serenity .
DryBath is a poor man &apos;s service and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually entering the process of setting this up , now we &apos;re entering a market mechanism that can bring it into the retail market , and a question that I &apos;m going to share with you today , at the Limpopo Crubble , with an elevator of 50 bricks a week to fashion the world that does not have to ruin the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And more importantly , I learned a lot in the early stages , Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur in the world , the first Africa to receive this account , and one of the things that really surprised me , and why this whole month did not want to be picked up . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , interestingly , I &apos;m here to share some of the results with you today , and I was also surprised to see what are the actual reasons why organizations succeed , which is really why they succeed .
I believe that the NGOs are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you choose a group of people with the desire to equality and organize them at the beginning , you will discover human abilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is it that the majority of failures occur ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know a lot of organizations about this , reflecting a lot of my misconceptions and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was building various firms from the age of 12 , from the position of Joer High School to Canada to the position of building solar power tools , then school , when I made a radio station .
I graduated from college and started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we launched 100 companies , many , many successes , many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain why organizations succeed or failed .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; Idea Leave &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s the old moment you feel at any given point .
Throughout that time , I thought perhaps the team , the walking ability , the walking ability , is more important than thinking .
I &apos;d never thought that there would be a TED Talk by Professor Michael Tunes , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , until I don &apos;t have a mom . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team is very important in recognizing the ability to train farmers on the side of the road .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at business models .
Does an organization have a clear effect on income ?
With this idea , I thought it was the most important thing for success .
So think about innovation .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
After that — is it time ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t set for it ?
It &apos;s quick , you &apos;re coming and teaching the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or has it been a long way since , and has it been a terrible thing before ?
So I applied these five factors to a lot of different organizations .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in Libya , and 100 others out of it could try and find any scientific results .
So first of these ideas , these first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all dollars of revenue .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — were very hopeful , but not very successful .
And then I tried to incorporate all these characteristics , as I think these companies had promised .
Then in the outbreak of ideas from Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and Linkeddin .
A couple of failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to understand that the most effects of factors worked in the success and the failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was choice .
At the right time , 42 percent is the difference between success and failure .
The team and the organization are on the other hand , and then thinking , having different ideas , having different ideas , is really a third number .
But it &apos;s not obvious , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t last forever , but it struck me that the idea doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the market model and the investment I understand .
I think the market model still needs to be limited , because you can do it without a market model , and then when the product grows in the coalmines , include it .
And even if investment was low in the beginning but it &apos;s now increasing , especially in today &apos;s long-term , investment is cheap .
I &apos;m here to give you some examples of all of these notes .
Take a big success on Airbnb , which everybody knows .
There were a lot of investors in this company because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to put a quarter of your household on a ticket ? &quot;
Of course , that was the wrong thing .
One of the reasons why mythology is so successful is because of the best market model , the best idea , and the best market perspective is the right time .
This company came in front of the financial crisis when people needed additional support , and it made sure that people could respond to a banana in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came together , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
But , time was absolutely right to make the drivers who needed it .
Dreaders also wanted additional insurance ; that was very important .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a website .
Goto.com , which we published at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to look beyond the screens .
We thought that was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so excited to do it — so with so many colleagues and a great business model , we had to work with great thinkers from the Hole in the company .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broad Internet was very , very small .
It was really hard to see the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and finally this company revealed itself in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the problem with the Adobe Flash was solved and the Broad Board of America was more than 50 percent played , YouTube was at its best .
Great idea , perfect time .
In fact , when YouTube started , there was no commercial model of it .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was the best .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
Ideas matter a lot .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to test time is to see if they &apos;re really quick at predicting your behavior .
And the real security thing is , the outcomes don &apos;t come from them , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work with lots of reliability over time .
As we said earlier , institutions can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of these conversations are helpful in increasing the chances of your success , and then the world may not be the other way around .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 April 3 , 2016 we looked at the biggest data point in history &#93; &#91; Financial Choice painted expensive and powerful people &#93; &#91; unclear money laundering companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Robert Prize to the Gulf Voters . &#93; This week , the warrior was the center of the Girl million papers that came from the Financial
From the Financial Report , these papers have drawn just a few secret weapon firms .
We have found the inner stories of villages , banks and schools that come in with patterns like Mozambique Foundation and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a home company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see email , you can see the exchange of messages , you can see the way it &apos;s done , how it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The president of Ashesi Land has been famous .
We also heard about the weapon of mass destruction writers from the Alliance Company .
The revenue from the revenue of two billion dollars goes to the Ross County Mediterranean Patent Pool from his childhood friend , a famous secretary .
And a lot of smart people are going to get infected , and the rest of the cases are going to be painting with more blank profiles . I &apos;m going to go home .
Now this looks like a magical movie , or a John Gutesian novel , with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that activists and powerful people stay in the position of their money and how much they should not pay as much tax , meaning that effective practices like teachers have less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization at Galapagos Ventures , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people have neglected their influence on the weaponry companies that we &apos;re discovering with our opinions .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to think that these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can put another company inside a company , a second company inside , so it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind it .
It &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s happening for companies ruling law enforcement , journalism , schooling .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that we haven &apos;t talked about this in the United States .
Maybe it &apos;s because the celebrities don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in burning companies .
That &apos;s why the Russian telephone companies , there are just a few Russians in the United States of Moscow .
I think if we study the findings of Kenema Illinand or Delhi View or Mohammed or News , the things that correlate with the United States .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give you little information to get the company out of the Liber Council .
In American schools , the hidden information is given to students .
It sends nine billion services into the area .
This kind of ritual affects all of us .
Now in the Galapagos Ventations , we wanted to look at how this machine works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did is we smuggled a branch and we flew over 13 tuna legal companies .
Our foundation became an African minister who wanted to transport a village across the U.S. to buy a home , a ship and a wall .
What was striking was that all of the villages could have predicted a single version of what a classroom could do .
These were all early meetings , and for some reason we didn &apos;t build our own currency , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone one , but that &apos;s how the system got worse .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individual lawyers who talked to us about abortion and evaluation .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who &apos;s found in the hospital .
This is a system that works , that protects electricity , fifth , dignity and unemployment .
And to be able to do that , we have to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder for these kinds of situations .
It can be awesome , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the smart and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
In the last few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the company talks about the country .
This issue was launched on political hangers-on , but the British Prime Minister David Comedy put it in eight centimeters of what was happening in southern London in 2013 .
And since then European Union is forming a central record on a regular level , whether or not there are companies in Europe or are controlling them .
The key thing is that the U.S. is behind it .
Compared to the map of the parallel law in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to grow very much , so we did five .
We want to look at the innovations , the larger secret of the Russian businesses , which were used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Galapagos Ventures .
There should be a burden in the people who know their loved ones after the Russians .
Remember , please raise your voice , don &apos;t be so good at determining this vision .
Politicians need to address this issue , promote a law change in access to information .
We can cooperate flexibly with the rhythms that are responsible for the pressure and pressure of the classroom .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Josh .
It &apos;s said that the Lex , the inventor of you , has made much more sense in the last few years than all the media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , can it be true ?
This is a query — what &apos;s not ? — that the media of the world is showing a lot of bad action , that it &apos;s able to get a small group of workers to produce information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people form documents ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , there are — I can tell you — public services are provided in the right way , and we have so many ways to get the information to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed storage keyboards to send material from one place on the Internet to somewhere else , to clear the signs to shift from legal contracts like Sweden and Bollywood .
We get the information from the cloud , from ordinary data , from Ram Shaheen or whatever , organizing it like public news organizations , forcing — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive information for the public and then protecting yourself against the negative laws and political beliefs .
CA : So you have to make sure that the documents are real , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ll always find these animals , and if we get to a point , we quickly add them to the skin .
( Cheers ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s coming from here and asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , that &apos;s the Koral report .
This was a secret journalism that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had turned 18 light years .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when the book came out — due to the authoritarian powers that were trying to convince Kenyan entrepreneurs — they bought 20 million pounds of this report and one other report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for their political will , which was the smartest man — now the smartest man in Kenya .
This is Jesus for the Kenyan press .
That &apos;s why in 2007 , we were able to accomplish this with the elections that had been elected before December 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after that new patient , Kabash decided to volunteer with the person who was horrified at Donal Arp , so this report was handed over and over in the Gulf of Kaaba .
CA : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s that — this thing was launched in Kenya , not out of prostitution , but in the media and in your opinion , it changed the outcome of choice .
GG : Yes . This is the heavy land of Gaddafi , and then it spread across the whole country of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he , after a couple of days , convinced Kenyan entrepreneurs that they could talk about it .
And this magazine was running on TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the vote , according to a Chinese Internet report , and it changed the result of election .
CA : Oh , so that &apos;s how your secret invention actually changed the world ?
GG : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re going to show you a little video of a hero sitting next to you .
It &apos;s a long video , but here &apos;s a little clip of one .
This — I &apos;ll tell you , this is a high-end video .
RG : ... That &apos;s great , when you first meet them , by the way .
I thought , oh , there are four with them all the time .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s OK . Galen is running .
When they stand in front of you , tell me , go ahead .
Hello .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost . Gill gets lost . ( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost .
Hotel . Blah master : two , six , six .
We should now walk , time is up !
Okay , now we killed eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two Hilly Crafters , and we &apos;re still seeing the plants .
Roger . He &apos;s on my doorstep .
Two six , that &apos;s two , six , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , it would be a shame . What was happening ?
God bless you . Hi . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it were very effective .
We ended up surveying two people .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
CA : So there were 11 people who voted in this case , right ? The two jobs ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two employees in the Reuters , two small children were killed .
The total was 18 to 26 people .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of anger .
What was the primary cause of the destruction , you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see the very high levels of power .
On the one hand , there are some strangers on the floor , and then from a kilometer away , the Appalachian Heiley Kepler starts pouring 30 miles of flowers into each of them — any number of them — and killing the refugees as children .
They also had two journalists who weren &apos;t rich anyway , because their profession was journalism .
Chris Anderson : According to the US Department of Defense , Bruce Manning was arrested , and he said that he had acknowledged in Chet Rome that he videotaped 280,000 and white American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanging : So we decided to accept the doctrine .
This is what it looked like five days ago , where 150,000 documents were received and 50 characters .
But we &apos;ve done it now in the beginning of the year with a reference to the River and the U.S. safety house , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you give thousands of articles to thousands of U.S. private companies ...
Julian Sanging : We &apos;ll do it . ( CA : Can you do it ? ) Julian Sanging : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sanging : Because things like this show that actually , what Arabic-speaking governments are doing now is violating human rights in these governments .
If you look at the hidden evidence , the material is in them .
CA : Let &apos;s just play around with it .
I mean , normally what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why should you care ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , the question is how important information in the world is , what information can be made possible .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They spend a lot of money on organizations to keep track of information , and that &apos;s a good indication when the information should come out , that there &apos;s something good going on , because the organizations know better , and they know better , and how to keep track of it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there risks to this as individually or as a collective society , where there &apos;s no exaggeration for innovation ?
Julian Sanging : This is not what we did with them .
I mean , our biggest hurdle is practical .
With the information , we can measure in a very specific way the information that &apos;s being collected — the information that &apos;s available to someone else .
But there are also some myths — your physician , for example , has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a generic path — but we &apos;re talking about the public services that come in and out of the sun .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing it with your gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is employed in the United States Senate , and she says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something that some people like to call others .
It shows an American science of dead people .
This influence — but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is wonderful .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? What are you going to answer ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , we &apos;re asking a lot of questions like this .
But remember in the cave , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what they think , it doesn &apos;t matter what they perceive .
Because they all see it every day .
It will transform their feelings and their thinking that gives them the money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re hoping for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to block these lights , you have to maintain a kind of flexibility in your mind ?
Julian Sanging : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the compassion that comes from other minds .
If they do that , that would be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it so that people are ethically inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to be doing it tomorrow .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , what did we make of this — is that this is where the invisibility came from .
You can also imagine that there would be various fears about Lux and Julia .
One is people &apos;s heroes of hope .
Or the problem .
What is the point of view of Jerusalem ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! There must be something .
CA : These are great people , Julie , great .
We have to try more . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done that for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is a little old , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanging : This is an example of what we do every day .
Last year — in November there were a lot of important Russians sitting in Banjo , like the Gulf Mecca , but not so big .
And we got the Report Mile — which was a very nice study about it — showed that , in fact , conservation workers from all the different counterparts of the oil companies had run up there and they had buried .
And it had some former military governments and so on .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were wondering , perhaps this company has done all this in a game of competition .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and I can see it sounds good , but we can &apos;t anticipate it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter one week after the campaign that he wrote , they wanted to look at the text bill . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to look at the text bill . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we need to talk about it and talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; And then they took this lead that we see on Scripture with the name of manufacturing with Microsoft and DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of reading and thinking about what the material is , and that is to write and get the letters from these people .
CA : All right . So how far do you get from your dad ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the time , we &apos;re pouring over a bunch of complex , multi-layered things .
Our desire to publish this in the last few months has become somewhat more successful because we improve our bureaucracy because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s rainfall .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing itself out , we &apos;re more comfortable with our capabilities because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in public services , but we don &apos;t have enough people to organize and anticipate this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , why is it that journalists and journalists dream about ?
Julian Sanging : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the kinds of materials that we have in common , so we have to develop institutions so that we can bring people together , we have to develop a lot of sensitivity to the materials of the commons , and then we have to develop very little sensitivity to things .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think where I learned that you went to 37 different schools as a kid .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movies business , and then they moved north , so it had the effect of both of these things .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychiatrist , so it &apos;s saying that all you can do is create a mental disorder .
Julie Song : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a hero at the age of a young man and you came to the theory of farming .
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl in that moment when this crime hit me .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a method that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Russian hardware that &apos;s been used to steal your grandmother &apos;s banks .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not the word that it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re driving a Grandma bank account , but do you think that &apos;s your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things that have helped them survive ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : good , affordable and bad people don &apos;t create compassion ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the green that I have learned from my father and some of the other brave and courageous people that are in my life .
CA : Can people not produce healthy and healthy characters , please ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a young man , so I &apos;m not very good at agriculture , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of raising a victim , which is approaching the police department .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So for the last time , let &apos;s just say this : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then the newspaper there has made it very resistant to your own story .
Instead , they challenged your status .
That makes you very famous in the Icelandic . So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , it &apos;s a great fact . You know .
The East Land went through a crisis .
That was the most powerful one .
The bank was growing tenfold to the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the rule of law Tilly Vinci caught up for five minutes before he was published , like a movie : a moderate anti-smoking movie appeared on the Depression , and the situation of the NBC was , &quot; Never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spent all that time , and we became very popular in the Icelandic border , I went to Iceland and talked about this problem .
And the thing about the people there was that it shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the Asian scientists in Sri Lanka , worked with some other international experts , we named the OELEs of a new kind of Leadership Act , so this is a kind of open media , because journalists from all over the world are the most secure place , the new Nebola outbreak .
One country like Ice Land is like Noah , which means the system gets upwards from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Australian Parliament properly agreed .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see total power , or is it going to be more like that ?
Julian Sanging : I can &apos;t believe where things are going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure for the law of free speech and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What &apos;s that got to do ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the icons of the audience into something called , June , honor , and all the power to you .
Julie Song : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I was doing this , which is a letter of the letter .
I was walking through the halls of my childhood Connecticut , and I saw this in the halls .
When I grew up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I got this email .
My team was shocked .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view , I realized how the rest of the world is thinking about it ?
And when I went to the temples where I would go to places like North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in the Netherlands , in London , there were four species of vultures reported — good , dark , silent and code .
And I thought that was kind of weird , and I was wondering whether anyone else would ever have this hollow-income model .
And when I went out to visit him , I realized people weren &apos;t watching these quadriplegic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To confine the natural world to a few elements , there is no unusual human nature .
This is the work that we did 10,000 years ago when we eliminated our forests .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , we &apos;ll see it with rocks and leaves , and you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cars , rats and lions .
It &apos;s also true of wishes .
If you look at the mines of New York City about 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see pictures , posters and magazines .
But if you look at the distance away , you &apos;re going to see just four arrows : the lane , the moon , but the moon .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Sir .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The Second World War gave us the greatest anxiety of being alive .
During the Great War , we developed technologies like swimming , hail polymers and so on , all of these things dropped out .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have come to see the fourth highest levels of income inequality .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that famine and sea agriculture have increased , and then in a couple of years , its income has increased greater than concentration .
Now if you collect rainfall and forest pollution , it will be equal to two Chinese births per year from sea .
My favorite example of using Chinese cooker is not the only one , because China is not the largest country , it &apos;s also the largest border .
Now let &apos;s turn to our four choices .
First , the U.S. and the West have the most utilized sea food .
The forest is an extremely bad product .
Only one foot forest takes five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest to get to the market .
The Indus traders are also infinitely rewarded .
In a study done in Delhi University , it turns out that burning coal from the local area is particularly ineffective for carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the forest grows in the forest areas are the forests of Mongolia .
Now let &apos;s look at these beautiful girls .
They document the foot of the Earth from their place , covering the beaches , the wildlife and the wildlife refugees , all sorts of important things for the environment .
There was something like this with the Civil Rights movement .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years eating millions of coal plants .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; the Nano Segment . &quot; &quot; Throughout the tape record , you &apos;ve seen that it &apos;s very controversial .
Today there are already some signs that leopard seals are falling apart , but with that large number of other signs , leaving them and turning them into food after leather .
And a lot of times , there &apos;s a lot of work going on in these places called the Red Brigades , which are called &quot; &quot; Red . &quot; &quot; This is the plate that we &apos;d like to look at on the River , which is turning it into food , which means that the ecosystem is eating itself and producing droughts .
After that , there &apos;s another big food in the United States and the West .
Tony &apos;s a global citizen .
The tuna has to navigate a very large area to organize as a knee .
We also have a region called the Physical Entertainment Organization , or the ICCAT — the International Committee for Remittances .
Carl Simpson also made a wonderful prediction of all the tones .
We can build tuna , but tuna doesn &apos;t have good tuna .
Many people don &apos;t know , but Tony &apos;s carrying heat .
She can carry over 40 miles an hour and cool her body down to 20 degrees Celsius .
All the benefits of this retirement have been nearly done .
The blood vessels on the floor are sharp , which is not very sharp .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creatures 40 miles away from the count of household are not able to stay in the ground .
Even when time has been good news , it doesn &apos;t have to be bad news .
This is my political connectome .
Connect was born in the Thar Desert .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot has a diameter .
There are over 300,000 signs in the politics of Connect .
Actually , I say there are more people in concert — ( Laughter ) if anyone solves the power of concrete , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere we go , these are the rocks that propel the kids to the temple .
As a result , we came to the party and we had a successful team of peers .
When the embarrassment began , the embarrassment was to build a foundation , the forest was six feet long .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s a little bit of false water , because if you look at the footprint on the footprint , they &apos;re called the footprint for peace .
Whereas the feedback is relatively simple .
It &apos;s hard to say something that &apos;s less than a dollar and a half .
But then again , the Sri Kardashian industry requires that he returned to the French Army rather than the French Army .
It &apos;s a system that produces oxygen that mimics the Earth .
This is seven percent of the year .
Even though we are spending a lot less money on getting to market , we are still spending a lot of money on the market .
We &apos;re not just raising the chickens , we &apos;re raising the chickens and the chickens .
We have skins that are eating fish and fish that are eating tea .
Because on the left-hand side , blood and hands and so forth , the mosquitos pay .
I wonder if there &apos;s a lesson that touched his hair and that one just touched his hair .
India is either first or first dead . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination plants taken out of the sea .
It &apos;s equal to the third of China or the fourth half of Americans who come out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philistines actually started as lions .
And it started with the owner of a local finance firm that the next day , nobody comes to McDonald &apos;s .
He went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s take a look .
What was more popular about the Indus script for the ocean was the evidence that Hello brothers couldn &apos;t .
So he built his lift song .
Sadly , the Indus script lasted for 30 centuries .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter sensor , so he brought the electronic code in .
Actually , the Philadelphia Sandwich is the largest mass-market art industry in the United States , moving 20 to 3 billion pounds a year from the Millennium Development Goals .
If we end the policies , the future choices may be trivial .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plant proteins in a very dynamic way in animal proteins , and it moves to the third world .
Actually , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; in nine months it &apos;s growing from an individual .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a silly joke .
It doesn &apos;t even have the EEG and the EEG scans that we think will be keeping us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
This represents a large sample of 20 million tons .
One possibility is that conservation policies have proven that we can eat it ?
Can we find a way to give it to peace instead of freedom ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a marvelous child who walks to the marketplace , who is ordinarily part of the housing and the most effective insulin costs .
This is October 3 , EPA and DDC .
So this is her ability .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few dollars a pound or A to T , and then turned it into a foot , we modified the leather and then spent a couple of dollars a month cleaning it up for free ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is homework is charity .
They have much more EPAA and ADHD .
The Indus calculus is particularly effective .
The cost of food to the market is only three parts .
Actually , it comes from about three steps .
The sea level rises by three , and in the meantime , they just gather .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our bureaucratic administration in our Western village is widely used by Facebook and Netflix .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , these are the major causes of sea life expectancy .
As you might think about the click , there &apos;s more protein and more protein in all these different texts , these are very effective indicators .
It &apos;s very simple .
And the last one is a question mark .
We can produce a material that can provide benefits for ocean protein .
These creatures should be green , they should be able to grow and change very quickly in their own capabilities , and they should be EPA , DHA Omix3 and Gate East .
It &apos;s still in the papers .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I say that , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we do that , the third component of the world &apos;s population is about 30 million in the ocean .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more advanced .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was too big to study the brain because I have a brother who is a neurological disease deficit .
Immediately and later , I wanted to think as a scientist , how can I connect my dreams to my reality and create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they don &apos;t integrate their dreams into a common reality and they act on it .
So I stopped looking for intense mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my wife &apos;s program in India , where Prime Minister Financial Bank worked at the leadership of the Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference between people &apos;s brains that are typically thought of as being compared to people &apos;s brains that are usually referred to as &quot; &quot; schizophrenia &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; bipolar disorder ? &quot; &quot; So what we &apos;re trying to do is construct a brain &apos;s microbial map of which cells are sending messages to &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the cell with &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the chemical , &quot; &quot; and
So I had a lot of courage in my life because I used to do this kind of stuff during the day , but on the weekends , at four o &apos;clock in the evening , I was traveling by the National Lens to a camel of these NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I had to find out that I was faced with an intellectual disaster .
The left side of my brain was a nine strokes .
And over the next four hours , I watched my brain completely disappear from the ability to understand any information .
In the morning of college , I was able to write and recall something .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I brought a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the last part of the brain that touches the back of the brain with the arm , and this is how it stays in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that the computer works like a parallel processor in the right part of our brain , whereas the left part of our brain functions like a seal processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the crossroads of a network of 300 volunteers .
But there are two sides of this .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing that each part of the world has a different understanding of the information , their minds are on different things , and if you allow me to let you know who they are , they &apos;re identical to each other .
The circumference — thank you . That &apos;s it .
Teacher : Well done .
( Laughter ) The only part of our brain right now is thinking about this moment .
Here &apos;s what our brain is thinking about right now in the image of our brain , and it &apos;s thinking organically about the movements of our bodies .
Information fills in the body and heals throughout the body through the nervous system and then it melts and forms a giant aluminum classroom that allows us to look at what exists in the moment and feel what &apos;s in the mind and what &apos;s in the mind .
I &apos;m an energy geographical activity surrounded by the energy geography of the left brain .
We have energy systems that are moving from one another , from the right-hand corner of the brain to the right , to the human family .
And at that time , we are brothers and sisters on this planet who are making the world better .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and strategically .
The left of our brain is about material and future .
The building on the left of the brain is like taking the largest album cocktail of our current day and analyzing it and then asking for analytics .
And it also organizes and organizes this information about all the things that are happening in the universe that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of the future — namely , our designs .
The symbols on our left correlate with language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that touches the world outside of us and our inner world .
It &apos;s that little voice that says to me , &quot; Hey , you need to remember to go home and buy something . &quot;
I need them in the morning ; it &apos;s my philosophy of computing that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice she says : I ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I am isolated .
I become the only person in the world who has access to clean energy and energy around you .
And that &apos;s the only part of my brain that &apos;s involved in this morning with the office attack .
On the morning of the destruction , I left my eyes on the back with a broken nose .
It was the same kind of pain that exists from elsewhere .
And that pain drove me like I did and left .
And then he leaves , and then he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary that I &apos;d never had any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing I do with my daily work . &quot; &quot; So I put the glass and I put it on my cardboard , which is the previous physical exercise machine .
Now , I &apos;m fascinated by this machine , and it feels like my hand is just the tip of a primitive person who has just touched the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , I think I &apos;m doing something bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I &apos;m perceived has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being , and I &apos;m perceiving it in the machine , but now I &apos;m in a beautiful and hidden place where
And it was all very strange and poor , and my heart was getting more blood flow .
So I got out of the machine and I started walking around the room and I realized that everything inside my body was simple .
And everybody is thinking very hard and very hard .
I have no relationship with speed , and I think there &apos;s a housekeeping problem , so all I have is an internal system .
I &apos;m standing in my bedroom ready to underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a sound that said , &quot; &quot; Oh my brother , I need to play you now .
Yes , my foot gets dry and then my balance goes up and down the wall .
I reach out and I look at my hand and I realize that I can &apos;t repair my body &apos;s walls anymore .
I have no idea where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to end , because my hand and my hand have held up with atoms and molecular walls .
If I was to understand something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my brain , the conversation in the back of my brain was quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s ever heard a television call from a remote control .
One last month .
First of all , I was surprised by the hidden emotions of my brain .
But then immediately , I found myself in another elevator in this huge spacecraft that was all around me .
And since I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; You &apos;re a lesbian . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I came back quickly with a sense of what I &apos;m calling a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think of the place that will be beautiful where you are completely dependent upon this tiny brain that surrounds you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere where where where my neighbors are pushing harder .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And if you look at all of your relationships outside the world , and any of those ideas have been lost .
And I felt a peace and anger .
And look at what it would look like if the back was dropped from this 70-year-old emotional weight that you were holding .
( Laughter ) Oh , I came up with a herbal pesticide .
It was beautiful .
So then my brain got there , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , wait a minute .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I want to help . &quot; &quot; So I brought nectar from the back of the house , and I put it into my office , and now I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I go to work ? &quot; &quot; And in this moment , my hand is completely disconnected .
It was then that I realized if my God was going to attack me , the next thing that my mind was telling me is how wonderful this was .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
There are going to be some brain scientists who have this opportunity to realize that they can consciously contract their own brains and that they can also go inside . ( Laughter ) Then one of the brains came to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very well-meaning woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time for free . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fighting , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . OK .
I have to call for help . I have to call my work . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the work that I did , and then I remembered that I had a worksheets on my phone .
Then I go into my studio room and I close out three inches of Matthew cards .
And I look at the top card , even though I can see with my naked eyes clearly what my fusion card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , not because I &apos;m not going to look at a dot .
And the vocabulary corresponds to the puns and the marks of the paper , and I was not learning anything .
And then I started waiting for what I call the letter of the exhibition .
And at that point , the typical truth was repeated , and I learned that this is not a card ; this is not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download a single inch .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the gymnosophist were on the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I don &apos;t have any other way .
So I take the phone and I put it there .
I took the banks and put them there , and now I &apos;m going to look at the cards , the big bubbles on the phone , and I &apos;m going to look at the cards .
But then I turn to my own notebook when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I had that number .
So I raised my hand like a donkey , and I put it on the synagogue , and then the other hand corresponded to these signals that when I came back to the normal truth , I could tell myself that I &apos;d been here first in India , and finally got all the way from India , and I heard that one of my cousins switched on the phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter
And then I say to her , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking about men ; I need help . &quot;
And the voice that speaks to me is &quot; &quot; wow . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then he went to see me that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and understand it until I tried to sing .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped .
And a little while later , I was walking through the Sierra Leone from one of the hospitals to another Massachusetts General Hospital .
I walked up and looked like a tiny baby .
Just like the poor man who kept his eyes on the prize and ran away from the poor man , I pulled out the energy and I felt the pressure of my spirit .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer independent in my life .
Or perhaps my doctor saved me and offered me a second chance of life or a moment of transition .
When I got to this stage , it was amazing to me that I still lived .
When I felt my soul shattered , then I gave life to God .
Now my brain was stroked apart between two different facts .
At that time , I started to move towards the emotional system , which was only in the case of pain .
The light changed my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were so dense and dim that I couldn &apos;t hear a voice or hear a voice from the background , and I was just scribbling my way through the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t really understand the anatomy of my body , so I felt enormous and wide like a person who was free from his belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant well-intentioned black hole melting in the ocean .
Great Firewall .
I got the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking it would never be possible that I would discover my greatest sense of humility and the possibility of finding within a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I am also alive ! &quot;
I still live and have been brought to sleep .
And if I have been brought to sleep , and I still live , then whatever life is , I have been able to access the neurons and I have seen the world filled with beautiful , respectful , empathetic people who know that they can someday feel that quality .
And they can choose to live and choose , and that &apos;s the right thing to do with the book on the left side of their brain , is to take their own steps in search of this primitive quality .
And then I realized how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What is this mystery that has taught me to draw my life ?
And he threw me to be healthy .
After the destruction of the destruction of the gymnosophist , the gymnosophist pulled out a blood vessel from my brain that was triggering the weakness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life , the power of life , with the ability and two very , very good minds .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step in the left-hand corner of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe . I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful pieces of cellular macular cellulose are a shape , one that everybody has .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a tiny way .
From chemical fertilization , Al Gore gave you an idea .
I &apos;m a pediatrician , a neuroanatomist .
I have an inside .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain scanning electrical activity , the more we put peace in this world , the more our planet is going to get serious .
And I thought that the idea needed to be replicated .
Thank you .

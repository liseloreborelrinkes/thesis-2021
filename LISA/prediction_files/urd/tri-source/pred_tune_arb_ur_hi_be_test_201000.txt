Good morning !
Are you people staying ?
They brought my name to the table , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the table in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Well , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young decade ago , I was sitting with my friends in the restaurant and eating .
So I asked the question : Do you have food in Arabic ?
She looked at me strangely , thinks she must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Mini , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , deal with it ! &quot; &quot; Blah said .
He was talking to me three men , as he was telling me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does it mean for &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl accurately . And everywhere .
How can they speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What is it about me that is worth sharing my language in my country ?
Where could this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there &apos;s a lot of people like me , who come to a point in their lives where they basically leave out everything that &apos;s in their museums , just because they love the words and are forbidden .
Should I embrace my whole culture , my thoughts , my thoughts , my spirits and spirits ?
We may have the most important warriors in childhood stories .
Would he have to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To be like them ?
What makes sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for the occasional authority as it did for me .
The Arabic does not ask what needs today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research that we &apos;re using in universities , the language that we use everywhere we work in the language that we teach when we work on a curriculum project , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the Freedom of Information Technology .
If we do that , they will outcaste us .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But another more important fact we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of mother .
Research says that in other languages , you have to translate to your mother tongue .
In other languages , the mother is the primary attribute of the linguistic script .
Why ?
Gibran Gilbert , when he first started writing , used Arabic .
All his thoughts , imaginations and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the vehicle where he grew up , felt a sense of happiness , a particular voice , and thought about it .
When they started writing in English , they had enough materials .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their essays in English , you feel the same joy , you feel the same sense .
You can imagine that these are the same teachers in English , the same little boy who lived in a village outside London .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies happen .
Germany , France , Japan and China are in all power .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the wall , they spend a lot of money on the expansion of the universe .
Do we know better ?
Well , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this growing mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to get to this developing world .
They were countries like us at a time , but they decided to try and push for progress , research , and move to countries , like Turkey , the employee , etc . , they were taking their language with themselves as though they were leaving the girls . They were protecting her .
They kept it close to themselves .
Because if you go to Turkey and the farmers &apos; products and the farmers &apos; markets , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these offices , non-verbal offices , as we are most of the time .
So to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to save their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Poverty , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a sign of the very fabric of our lives , and the vocabulary that separates us from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you is going to create a special place in your brain — there are feelings that are specific for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What about our mind ?
How would you say you understood it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the age of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , then I better go and spend a lot of time talking about insurance .
It &apos;s that these affections remind us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker who &apos;s suffering from a French speaker .
I was asking her for a second .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his wife and translate it one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Women typically called it &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He wondered , how could it be that way ?
Do they want to self-destruct ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Time and two ) This is one of the few .
It made us realize that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought about it was different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; She , she listens to me with the Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate for her to feel what I felt when I heard Fridays . &quot; &quot; Billie woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she said , &quot; And because you &apos;re me , I put my hand up and you leave . &quot; ( Laughter
I &apos;m rewarded . I &apos;m rewarded .
( Applause ) So , what have we done to stop the Arabic language ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society and we started the Arabic language Conservation campaign .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Whatever the hell is , come on upset . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protection campaign heard a saying , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t use this method , because in this way , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate in Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be realistic in the way that our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the way the letter looks and the way we think .
So this sentence , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; Put it right .
It &apos;s very simple but efficient .
After that , we started another campaign with the land of Himalayas .
You , you &apos;ve seen an example out there , of a framework in which the letter black and blue is in the reverb , with the translation , &quot; kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really should not kill our language .
If we kill our language , we have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very easy to see the opportunity to create new and new ideas .
After this , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
Cole models of girls and boys .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve read the word &quot; &quot; college . &quot; &quot; They want to confirm as much as two , but I have to convey a word that is good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t teach ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be convinced that we &apos;re not going to let anyone be open to creating a bigger or understanding that we have a choice about language , putting pressure on us , or shaping our patients and thinking about it .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the Global Goals .
She can re-grade Arabic on the front page .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s solutions .
But we have to know this , and we have to be sure that the solution is there , part of the solution .
By the summer , what can you do today ?
Which of you have tattoos ?
For Muslims , I recommend you , though , my time is over , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin letters !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You will enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back and grow back .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the translation of the language needed .
Now let me tell you a secret .
A child is born with a language for the first time .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I promised my daughter to come to the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , mama . &quot; &quot; No , mama .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of humiliation . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that we remember the tragic injustice that our presence was not a miracle , and I was being blessed with the tiny father who &apos;s asking my people , even though you didn &apos;t see me banking my generation , when we were stressed out of this generation of inequality , it wasn &apos;t until they were celebrating our generation , until they were celebrating our
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , my primary attorney was a corporate warrior , which meant I had to write a lot of magazines .
Now , a typical person writing something , that &apos;s the way it works .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll do the work quick , but in the first week , you do a lot of work and later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s done . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be everything , but it &apos;s going to actually get to the top of the text , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens to every activity .
And then again came the whole new research paper , the paper that you fulfill in a year .
And I knew that my common approach was not restricted to the status quo .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , and I decided that I would do something like this .
It &apos;s going to go something like this this this this year .
I &apos;m going to start with smaller work , in the middle of the months , I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
Then there was a funny thing .
A few months ago ?
Go home and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we came up with a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by one month , two weeks went by .
And then I went away one day and I spent three days in the TED Line , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads — people shouldn &apos;t go on two roads — one day , two roads in the chambers , two roads , three hours a day , and I put everything on the screen .
I thought , well , it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom Rivers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you about your issue . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;m going to look to you today , that &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
She was very welcome . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; This is just amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My anger is constantly pushing six people and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s happening in the brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that the brain makes a difference between six people .
To find out that I made a leaf where I could analyze both brains of Brain and yellow brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , it &apos;s not that hideous , but look at it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the stereotypes are in the human brain that enjoy it .
Now what does this mean for a star ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is the best time to work . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart man will make a decision to make sense , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he takes the baton stand , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please read the page of the curtain . &quot; &quot; Nancy and the skeleton of the television , because I know it &apos;s still happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;ll go to the synagogue , and see what happened in 10 minutes ?
After this , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , beginning with a conversation about the third end of the TED conference , and much later on , watching the Internet for Mother Nature .
( Laughter ) It will take a while for all of those things , so it won &apos;t take time to do anything else today .
What a shame ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the basis of the happiness you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t know the future , but it has two things : ease and enjoy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you are someone and you spend your entire life getting faster and easier , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to create , there is a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and a growing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , you haven &apos;t been paying attention .
We are an increasingly educated species , and we don &apos;t even know it .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he thinks about all of these things .
And all we want to do is to manage what we enjoy .
Sometimes the farmers seem to be the right thing to do , which is easier and more pleasant food , like food , shelter or opportunity .
That &apos;s a terrible thing to do .
Sometimes they do .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big cause .
And this is the climate agreement .
And for strangers , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends a lot of time in the short run , a simple and mysterious way that &apos;s out of the wall .
I call this a perfect place .
( Laughter ) The dark matter is the place where strangers are so close together .
This is where dignity is at the moment when it &apos;s not supposed to be dominating .
In the dark sphere , what you find is no longer true , because it &apos;s not true , spatial awareness , anger , frightenment and self-hostility — all the characteristics that go along at the right places .
The question is , in this way , when the source is celebrated , how do you put aside human beings into the atmosphere , which is less happy but more important ?
It &apos;s evidence that institutions are protective , that people protect them all the time in their exact moments — somebody has asked them to shut down .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s a housekeeping thing , but when the downside is close , it &apos;s wonderful whether or not people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that the product only works .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , the TED guys called me and gave me the TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
My wish was to come to TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But among my joy and courage , there was something else going on in the brain of conscious decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow ?
We need to start working on it now . The publisher said , &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and see the map of India below 200 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house till we see India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , the TED guys decided to call the Koran .
I picked up the web and took a picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The guests were manipulated , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he &apos;s afraid of the house — he rolls down the tree !
And finally , and finally , the religious decision maker picked up the bill and I could start working on the conversation .
Now , the homework assignment that explains all kinds of crazy packaging , any kind of person like me would give two weeks to two and a half thousand weeks to the beginning of the assignment , and then suddenly the unbelievable contribution to the assignment is to go out and write a letter .
And three clear-cuts are what we call the system of smart people .
It &apos;s not very nice for anyone .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was struck by the implications of it .
I actually got thousands of emails from all over the world and from people who were faced with various opinions .
They included the engineers , the bankers , the engineers , the protesters , and also the CDs .
( Laughter ) And everybody was telling me one thing and saying , &quot; I too am in trouble . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails in the question and the number of emails .
There was a mythology in the script of these people to write about how much Saint Rauf spent in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the solution ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out there are two dimensions of the system .
Today I gave you all these examples , talking about subjects , all of them being data lines .
And when the data is online , the effects of the recent are key because of the domestic violence .
But the system has a second kind of relationship , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data online .
So if you want a project that starts itself like some kind of arts or businesses — some kind of arts or businesses , until you start finding the machine to do the math , to keep doing the work .
There are also many other things besides jobs that don &apos;t have to do with David Online , such as having to engage with your family , exercise , think about your health , think about your relationships , tell your relationships well that you don &apos;t care about .
Now if the only way you can do the harvest is to do the harvest , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data online , in the case of the household , disappears .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest effects are that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a long-term kind of snobbish that comes from watching too little and talks about less than just the lyrics , the ridiculous basic literature .
You are suffering from noise and bad news .
And this can be driven by long-term stewardship and refrigeration .
So I thought that was the reason they had email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in trouble .
They &apos;re not set up for a plan .
The Taliban recruitment system has backed them , sometimes in their own lives .
The trouble is not that they can &apos;t ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and there was one thing that came out — I think six people didn &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and some of you may have had good relationships with Linux , but remember the keys when there &apos;s no digital curve .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the Clinder of life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s the new year .
These are not very many blocks , especially when some of them are expensive .
I think we all need to be careful with this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to act compassionately .
It is for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that home there , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from now on , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One day in the United States and Afghanistan , an eight-day assembly of the United States and Afghanistan was moving from a part of Afghanistan to a part of Afghanistan that helped provide an office for the Afghan government to protect a government office to protect a government office so that Afghan government could help protect a government office to protect a government office that would help prevent the Afghan government from prison villages from having to
He arrived at the height of an incident , and he was surrounded by three and a lot of things , and he watched as a child by the Cape Town , he watched as a child by the time Captain Saveen was born to save the deaths and save the deaths .
One of the people who knew her children , one of the surgeons and one of the other men , a Spanish , was moving towards a Hebrew keyboard , and he was moving towards a Hebrew cartoon with a hidden camera .
It &apos;s shown that the clearance of the captain &apos;s Seventine and Ice are tracking this mysterious magic that melts through the ice .
They put it into the Hole in the Wall computers , and then you see the Catton smoke and bite it before they smoke to protect others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a loving one , and I knew why I do it with people who don &apos;t .
You know , in the garden , you &apos;re given to people who are desperate to experience themselves in order to benefit others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to judge others so that we can help .
We have an electronic calculus !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just the best people .
That &apos;s why they land on the wall .
These people are moving towards this idea of serving , and these people are moving towards this idea of serving .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so that each and every one of us has the capacity to engage and do this , and increase it so that we have the capacity to do it in others .
I &apos;ve had the great privilege of meeting with some of the people that we &apos;re going to call Yesterday — the great privilege of meeting with some of the people that we &apos;re going to call Jesus Christ — who took his knowledge and put them in danger to save others and asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and cooperation are critical .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they &apos;re emotions , not victims .
I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; Stand me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It may not be that I give two people the chance to cooperate and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does this excitement come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , to the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all of these tissues are working hard for us .
Nothing personal .
Wanting is a lack of resources , a lack of imagination , but it &apos;s working together to reduce the lifespan of everything that &apos;s working together to reduce our lifespan .
And so we were ready in the form of social animals where we all gathered and gathered together as part of what I call a charity , as in a neighborhood where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was fun and collaborative .
It has a constant benefit .
It means I can walk through the night and I can scratch the surface of some of my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are trying to make our lives harder or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
This economy can scale up dramatically unbelievable in the stock market .
It could be a new technology that pulls your commercial bread away at night , it could be a new technology that can lead your commercial break through the night .
Or you may have a fight that sometimes tries to fight you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but it at least drives your development and tries to take your businesses away from you , and it drives your development and your businesses to drive away from you .
We have no control over those powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the intensity is , because it believes that the direction is going .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in his organization and their lives that are meant to protect the people in his organization and protect the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to assess their personalities and their hidden results so that people can experience their dignity and their hidden results so that people can feel secure and feel their own relationships , that things can be prevented .
I was walking down a hill , and I realized the fact that when a driver was trying to step into the hall before he was found it , and I saw the staff on the door just before he passed the room as he passed the law as he was crying .
Once I had stepped onto him , the first time I ever attempted to step on him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep washing machines like these ?
Why can &apos;t you handle it as humans ? &quot; &quot; And from then on , he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Airlines is not because they keep improving the Lamanic people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t run from their leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from each other , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from each other , and that makes organization worse .
What a great leader can do for him is to have the most close example of what a good parent is to be a good leader for him , and the most close example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what would you like ? What makes — ( Laughter ) a good parent ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our children opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the opportunity to grow and get more out of what we can do for ourselves to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when they want to give their people the opportunities , education , organization and record , when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to trust themselves , to be optimistic and fail so that they can achieve more achievements that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more achievements than ever imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump in New York City , is the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump in New York City , and he says one thing that if you have a tough time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie has done the business of promoting prostitution , and Charlie has done the business of promoting prostitution .
If you have a job in the Next Jump , you don &apos;t get to work on the basis of the work .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will mentor you and help you , in exactly the same way that we would like to give to our kid who walks home from school to GDP .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , that there are so many people who are frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , that there are so many people who are frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , who are so uncomfortable with depression and so on .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have laid down fundamental principles of value .
They &apos;ve created a denser society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones by giving us their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given up on their loved ones by giving us their loved ones , rather than saying they &apos;ve encouraged their loved ones by giving them their loved ones more than saying they &apos;ve given up on their loved ones by giving them their loved ones .
This is what we assume , not data .
Can anyone guess why the market has invested 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t Motors bring 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with this ? Absolutely not .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Instead , they will give people skin data to save , but they will give people skin data to save .
A mini-cab driver in the Boston Media Lab run a mini-cab company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 called for the big business , and they built 30 percent of their roads overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very big problem and they can &apos;t afford to buy their branches more often .
They needed 10 million dollars to be saved , so many of the companies that have now joined the board and did a sudden procedure .
And Bob answered that .
You &apos;ll notice that the Bombay cannot believe in the Gulf .
It &apos;s also believing in the generation of the Budrus , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce heart attacks and reduce heart attacks than it is to reduce heart attacks .
And then they built a personal project .
That every job , from CEO to CEO , had to hire everyone in a small four-week vacation .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob explained the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said that it &apos;s better than all of us to accept small decisions , because some of us can make much more decisions and feel better .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody expected , people began to trade off each other .
The ones who were more successful did business with less successful people .
That is , somebody has licensed five volunteers to license one another in three volunteers .
Knowledge is an extreme , not a contradiction .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing , and I know a lot of people who are very well interested in organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs and we do what they say because they have access to us but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know so many people across the board of organizations who have absolutely no authority , and they are real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have had the privilege to see the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have so much fun looking at the person on the left and they have so much fun seeing the person on the right , and they have so much fun to see the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some physicists who were out in the theater and like the philosopher &apos;s method of eating tomorrow and giving up on his men and not save anything for him when he eats .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some of his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them they do it .
We call them the leaders because they take risks before each other , we call them the leaders because they take risks before each other .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them from what we call leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can protect them and make them better , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people can protect us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and paper and so they &apos;ll see that their leader &apos;s desire becomes real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you give up your blood and paper and you can give it to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all said one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story of the Limpopo , the Limpopo and the Mumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is so unbelievable , and in these circumstances it &apos;s very difficult to grow up once , at 17 years old , I was staying with friends in the museum quietly staying in the museum .
The sun is warmer in the winter .
And as I was dozing off into the bush , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t make you cry ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I did . I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-four million of them are in Africa , and there are few in South Africa alone .
Different diseases occupy the environment that is most dangerous .
The reason the tragedy in the eyes is an injection given to the naked eye by having more than one of the diagnoses of the tragedy you can naturally fire .
This disease kills eight million people a year , and the most troubling thing to do is to keep yourself from the trachoma : no loans , no farms , no engineering .
After watching these statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then a week of my husband &apos;s 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , not a network , but on 20 hours of Google footage , published a study on Google
And I looked at this as a special problem in the box .
So Mohammed said yes , our formula has been set .
Now we need to be careful .
Four years later , when the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses writing my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; No more gold ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first email exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a skin .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and under the limited resources that I had , the Millennium Development Goals Index brought in some new people , did this work , and now we have a full-scale model , which is ready for the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They purchase what they need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a ticket to Alex , and they buy a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how it feels .
So we put DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just pull it in and drop it outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple one is exposed to a pill only in five ways .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath the heavy infantry to get there . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water on the average , whenever they leave the garbage and we could save two houses for children , which are already in the areas , two houses , more than two hours for school lunch , two more houses for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken out our core values of values , health and solar .
DryBath is a brilliant man and a life of a poor man .
This project takes place in the process , now we &apos;re actually entering a market mechanism that could supply it to the retail market , and one question I want to ask you today for members of my audience at the Limpopo Circle , in a week , cutting 50 lines a week with an alphabet that does not have to cover the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And more importantly , I learned a lot in the early process , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I am still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African to ever come to this campaign , and one of the things that really surprised me , and why all of this campaign didn &apos;t want to be raped . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m excited , I &apos;m here to share some of the results with you today , and I was also surprised to see what are the real reasons why organizations succeed , which is really why they succeed .
I believe that nonprofit organizations are the best way of making the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find human capabilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;re going to make them possible .
But , if initial organizations are so great , why often fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success at the very beginning .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , reflecting a lot of my misconceptions and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations last year to me .
I wanted to know this because I was building various shops from the age of 12 , from the position of Joer High School to the position of Kandy to the school when I was building solar panels , then to college , when I was making a radio station .
I left school and I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve launched over 100 companies to do many , many , many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain why organizations succeed or fail .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
That &apos;s why I called my company &quot; &quot; ideas Live &quot; &quot; the last moment you feel about it .
Throughout that time , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to be skilled or injured , are more important factors than I think .
I &apos;d never thought that these were going to be disappointed at TED last year , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s got a plan , until I don &apos;t read a prize on me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team has the ability to license a vehicle upside down .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought that maybe the team is the most important thing .
So I started looking at business models .
Does an organization have a clear policy about income ?
It seemed to me that this was the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes institutions make a huge investment .
Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
After this , of course — is it time ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t set for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or was it too late , and already too frightening ?
So I &apos;ve gone through many of these five factors in many organizations .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in Libya , and 100 others out of that have tried to get results in science .
So first of these ideas on laptops , first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of revenue .
And at the bottom of five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we were hopeful , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to build all these characteristics , as I think these companies had promoted .
And then in companies outside Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the most effective factors had the success and the failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was the choice of time .
The right time is 42 percent in the difference between success and failure .
The team and the lecture is on another number , and then thinking , being different , thinking separate , it &apos;s actually number three .
But it &apos;s not really clear , not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and shocked me that the idea doesn &apos;t matter most .
Sometimes it matters more when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my mind .
I think the market model still remains pervasive because you can do it without a commercial model later , when the product expands in the coalmines .
And investment , if initially low investment , is now increasing , particularly in today &apos;s long-term investment , is very easy .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these dots here .
Take a major piece of Airbnb that everybody knows .
Many of the investors in this company were noticed because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put any of their houses on the shelves ? &quot;
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons why mycorrhiza was successful is because of the best market model , the best market model , and the best market perspective is the right time .
This company came in front of the financial crisis when people needed additional support , and it was certainly helpful to people to respond to advertising in their own home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
But , the time was absolutely right : get the drivers behind it .
The driver was also demanding extra income ; it was very , very important .
Some achievements , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 at TED , was at a time when companies wanted to look beyond the screens .
We thought that was great , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was the online entertainment company .
We were so excited to do it — so with so many colleagues and a great commercial model , we had to deal with the great heroes at Hollywood to work with the company .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband Internet was very , very small .
It was really hard to watch the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company revealed itself in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and lowered 50 percent in the broadband band in America , YouTube was reached at the very best .
Great idea , the best of times .
Of course , when YouTube started , there was no commercial model of it .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
It matters a lot .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to test time is to see if they &apos;re really ready for your own performance .
And the unbelievable thing is , the outcomes don &apos;t come from the outcomes , because if you like something , you want to stay in the future , but you have to work with a lot of reliability over time .
As I said earlier , organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them will be helpful towards increasing your success , and then the world may not be the other way around .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; On April 3 , 2016 , we saw the biggest data shark in history . &#93; &#91; Fifth Prime Minister pointed out poor and powerful people . &#93; &#91; A crime scaled up in nonprofit &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Robert Prize to the Global Voters . &#93; &#91; A crime center of this week was focused on the campaign that brought
From the point of view , these papers were documented by secret weapon firms .
We find the inner stories of villages , banks and schools that come with patterns like the Museum of Financial and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housekeeping company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messages , you can look at the way it &apos;s done , how it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The president of Arizona has been famous .
We also heard about the weaponry factories held by veterinarian aid workers .
The revenue of the two billion dollars goes to the base of the Russian Empire from his childhood friend , the famous Sestament .
And many brilliant people will be infected and still be at home with stories of additional hidden devices .
Now this looks like a magical movie or a John Geiger character novel .
What should we do with it ?
But it turns out that activists and powerful people are staying in the business of putting their money where they shouldn &apos;t be taxed , which means that infrastructural achievements like schools get less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization at Global Witness , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people handle their influence in the weaponry companies that we &apos;re discussing with our opinions .
I think it &apos;s a churning world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can run a second company inside a company , a second company inside , so it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind it .
It &apos;s hard to understand why institutions that are broadcasting laws , journalists , schools in the U.S.
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s particularly interesting in the United States .
Perhaps that &apos;s why the most famous Americans don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in road companies .
It &apos;s because of the road companies , there are only a few Russian American citizens .
I think if we &apos;re going to read the novels of Kim Illinand or the Wall Wall or the Mayans or the New Zealand , what &apos;s going on with the U.S.
Instead , a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give us enough information , you have to give us less information to get the company than the library card goes .
This kind of information is thrown away in American schools .
It makes nine units of investment accessible .
This kind of gossip is affecting all of us .
Now in the Galapagos Ventures , we wanted to look at what the problem is .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we smuggled a campaign across 13 government companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to move to the South America to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
What was so striking was that all of the villages could have predicted a metaphor to predict how to move their heart .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t set up our cash for anyone , and we didn &apos;t give anyone a money , but it seemed like a bad estimate .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual law that talked about our hidden assumptions and our proposals .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who &apos;s found in Sandel .
It &apos;s a system that works , that protects taxation , fields , poverty and unemployment .
And to be able to do that , we have to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder for this kind of stuff .
It can be awesome , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the company talks about ownership .
This issue was solved on political hangers-on , but the British Prime Minister David Comedy put it in a no-eight seats that happened in southern London in 2013 .
And the European Union has been forming a central record on the ground , whether or not there are actually any companies in Europe or are controlling them .
The downside is that the I.S. is behind it .
The contradiction in terms of regulatory laws in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to grow as much , so we did fifth .
We want to look at innovations , larger sections , which are used throughout the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in global warming .
People should come to grief with the people who know their loved ones behind barbed wires .
You know , they sound , they &apos;re not good at predicting this flexibility .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to lobby for the legitimate changes of access to information .
We can cooperate flexibly with the secrets that are responsible for teaching and teaching student loans .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Likh , who &apos;s your invention , has had a much higher intuition in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Song : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a paradox — what &apos;s not ? — that media all over the world is showing us that having a small group of employees is able to produce information that is far more than all the other media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people make decisions ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julie Song : Yes , there are — I can tell you — public services in the right way — and we have so many ways to get the information to us .
Therefore we use a lot of high-speed storage to send material from one place on the Internet to another , to clear away the signal from legal contracts like Sweden and Bill .
We get the information databases , whether it &apos;s Ram Shaheen or whatever , organizing it like normal news organizations , petitioning it — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about presenting huge amounts of information to the public and then protecting yourself against the inevitable legal and political hangers-on .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is real , but you actually never know what the tool is .
Julie Song : This is right , we &apos;ll be able to find these lives everywhere . And if we go to a period of time , we quickly obtain the information .
( Gunshot ) God beats her .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s coming from here and asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s take an example , real .
This is something you described a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julie Song : Yes , this is the Koral report .
This was a secret magazine that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had been there for 18 years .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when the book came into power — because of the original powers that were trying to figure out how to fix this , they put 20 million pounds on the Report , one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to protect its political hangers-on , which was the wealthiest man — now the wealthiest man in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why in 2007 , we were able to accomplish this with the great election , the election , the election , before December 2008 .
When we did that report , three days later , after we opened that new president , Kabash decided to volunteer with the person who he was suffering from , Daniel Aravj , so this report was hung in the corner of the capital city .
CA : And — so I mean , just briefly , it &apos;s — it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by the government itself , but by the mean , it &apos;s transformed the result of your choice .
Julin Sung : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafi , and then it spread across the entire country of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And she , a few days later , gave the wonderful advice to Kenya that they could talk about it .
And this blog was run on TV 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the decision about 10 percent of the vote , according to an online sex report in Kenya , and it changed the outcome of the choice .
CA : Wow , so did your secret breakthroughs actually change the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : There you go . We &apos;re going to show you a little video of a little clip of a windmill .
This video is so long , but here &apos;s a little clip of one .
This — I &apos;ll tell you , this is a cardiovascular video .
RD : ... It &apos;s great , when you first pick them up and steal them .
I thought , oh , there are four things .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s OK . The gas is running .
When they &apos;re in your office , tell me — go away .
Hello .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Galen is running . Gill is running . ( Machine noises ) Gill is running .
Hatel — two , six , six , six .
We should walk , time is up !
Okay , we killed eight people .
We &apos;re looking at two Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Rajasthan . He &apos;s on my side .
Two , this is two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what the hell would be ? What was happening ?
God will kidnap you . Hi . Well done . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julie Song : People who worked on it had a very strong effect on it .
We finally did a survey of two people .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
CA : So 11 people voted in this attack , two guys from the Obama campaign ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two employees in the Reuters , two small children were killed .
It was basically 18 to 26 people .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of anger .
What was the primary cause of harm , you think ?
Julian Song : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with a very strong disbalance of power .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the street and then a kilometer away from the neighborhood , Hilly Kepler starts pouring over 30 miles of gallons of electricity on either side — any amount of money — and it also kills the children .
They also had two journalists who weren &apos;t brave , because they were brave .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. Department of Defense , Brad Minister , and he said that he had acknowledged the video that he had posted to you about 280,000 and a half American documentaries as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Song : So we decided to accept the document .
Five days ago , it appeared that 50,000 documentaries were made and 50 .
But we &apos;ve now given them a copy of the River and the American private house in the first year , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of articles from the American private home ...
Julie Singer : We &apos;ll give them a rig . ( CA : Will you do it ? ) Julie Song : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julie Song : Because this kind of thing shows you that actually , what the Arab states are , for example , violating human rights in these states .
If you look at the hidden evidence , these types of materials are in them .
CA : Let &apos;s just play around with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you store hidden information ?
Julie Singer : Yes , the question is how important information in the world is , how powerful information can be .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They spend more money on corporate security , and that &apos;s a good indication when the data should come out , there &apos;s something good about it , because the organizations know better , and they know better about it , and how to fix it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of innovation .
CA : But are there risks to this as individually or as a collective society , where you might not expect to get out of the way ?
Julie Singer : We did not do the same thing we did with them .
I mean , our biggest hurdles are practical .
With information , we can gather in a very specific way the information that &apos;s being produced — the information that &apos;s available to someone .
But there are also some mysteries — you know , your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about public services that come in and out of noise .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing it very passionately .
And what you would say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is employed in the United States Senate , and she says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something that some people like to call others .
There &apos;s an American science behind it that shows people dying .
This influence — but it has made millions of people worldwide that the U.S. military is a military tool .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julian Song : Well there are many questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video every day .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference in their behavior , it doesn &apos;t make a difference in their perception .
Because they see it every day .
It will change the incentives and incentives that make it all the money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you seem to be hopeful for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous if you didn &apos;t have to have privacy in order to get this lightning ?
Julian Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the compassion we have from other minds .
If they do this , it &apos;s a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically committed to sending money home that they &apos;re doing it tomorrow .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , we &apos;ve all heard about this before — it &apos;s about the blind .
You can also imagine that there would be various icons about the lions and the lions .
One is people &apos;s heroes of hope .
Or the problem .
What does the hell &apos;s point of view look like ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Song : Oh ! Somebody must be there .
CA : These are very good people , Julie , very good .
We have to try more . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
Now this is a very interesting story , right ?
What is this ?
Julie Song : This is a metaphor for what we do every day .
Last year — in the middle of September , there were very important roads to bananas , like the Gulf was in Mexico , but not that big .
And we got the Report Mile — which was a very good piece of it — showed that , in fact , conservation workers from all the different oil companies had put in there and put in place .
And he had some former military governments and so forth .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us to do .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , maybe this company did all this against something .
We ran it to the base , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it looks good to see , but we can &apos;t imagine it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter one week from this guy writing this , and he wanted to deliver it to the device . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to deliver the device . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , let &apos;s talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show paper that you own it ?
Is this really you ? And then they took what we think of as Scripture with the name of the factory with microflute LED .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It has happened so many times .
It &apos;s a way of measuring and predicting what the materials are , and that is to try to write and get the letters from those people .
CA : All right . So what &apos;s the data from inside the bag ?
Julian Song : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the time , we &apos;re struggling to collect and refine things as difficult .
Our desire to publish this has become somewhat more successful in the last few months because we &apos;re moving our beta system up because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s rainfall .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s flourishing , we &apos;re overwhelmed by our capabilities because of our growth , and that means that we have a population of public services that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have enough people to be able to organize and anticipate all that information .
CA : So that &apos;s the problem , fundamentally , with the ambition of journalists or journalists ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to solve because the materials that we have in the middle have to innovate so that we can get those people who have a lot of sensitivity to work on the materials of regulation , and then less sensitivity to business .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is this right ?
Julian Song : Yes , my parents were in the business of films and then moving away from the city , so it had an impact on both of those things .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychiatrist , so what I mean by that is that everything that can be done can be created by the mind .
Julie Song : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a hero at a young age and you were kind of right into the workforce .
Julie Song : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was a girl in that moment , when this crime was happening to me .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at the time , it &apos;s only Russian hardware that &apos;s using your grandmother to get a bank account .
That &apos;s why the word doesn &apos;t matter as much as it did before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps an event in your life that helped them survive ?
Julian Song : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : good , affordable and evil people are not producing enemies ; they &apos;re growing them .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some of the other brave and courageous people that are living in my life .
CA : Brilliant and healthy people don &apos;t create waste products ?
Julian Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed man , so I &apos;m not very good at breastfeeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of enhancing the insurance , which is approaching the police .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve just got this in the last few years : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you &apos;ve done something out there , you &apos;ve had a problem with a bank , and then you &apos;ve given the newspaper the article about drowning .
Instead , they scaled your expectations .
That makes you very famous in the Iceland . So what happened ?
Julie Song : Yes , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
NASA has run an economy from a crisis .
Here it was .
The banks there were 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the rule of law Taylor Weidn was criticized five minutes before he was released , as in a movie : &quot; The prohibition of the status quo came to Newcastle , and the status quo of the radar was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spent all that time , and we became very famous in the Ice Leand , I went to East Land and talked about this problem .
And the elements of the people there knew it shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the sixth-graders of NASA , working with some other international experts , we proposed a new kind of Ice Land law , so it was a kind of freedom media , because the journalists around the world were the most secure place , the new Nobel Prize for free .
A nation like Ice Land is similar to the Noor , which means the system gets upwards from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Alliance for Parliament celebrated it .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you realize that there &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Song : I can &apos;t believe where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to pass the laws of free will and the laws of transparency around the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
Who &apos;s going to get that one ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience to say , welcome , honor and all the power to you .
Julie Song : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I was doing this , which is a mustache .
I was walking through the halls of my childhood Connect , and I saw this chasing in the halls .
When I grew up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I got this email .
My team was shocked .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view , I realized somehow how how how how how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the Millennium Development Goals , everywhere I went , surprisingly , to North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or to London , every time I went to Bermuda , there were four creatures — wonderful , tough , silent and code .
And I thought that was kind of weird , and I was wondering whether anyone else would ever have this once-in-a-lifetime discovery .
And when I took that leave , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at the coalmines .
Ordinary people see something like this .
By restricting the natural world to a few elements , there is no unusual human nature .
We did it 10,000 years ago when we finally eliminated our caves .
If you look at the fire from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see the blood and the blood , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cars , bricks and stars .
It &apos;s also true of strangers .
You look at me walking along the streets of New York 150 or 200 years ago in the middle of nowhere , you &apos;ll see pictures like cartoons , bricks and South .
But if you look at the distance from the present , you &apos;re going to be left with four passengers : the lanes , the lanes , the mountains , but the mountains .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Sir .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The Second World War gave us the greatest inspiration to become a warrior .
During the Cold War , we had advanced technology like the Susan , the Hole in the Wall , and everything else was missing .
And since the end of the Second World War , there have been four major breakthroughs of mass survival .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the salt flowers and the sea flowers have been increasing dramatically over the last two years , so its income has increased dramatically .
Now , if you collect the forest flows and the forest flows , each year it will be equal to two China per year .
My favorite example of using Chinese cooker isn &apos;t the only one , because China is not the largest nation , it &apos;s also the largest embassy .
Now let &apos;s turn to our four legs .
The first one in the U.S. and the West is the most utilized salt food .
The war is an incredibly bad product .
Only one pound forest flower will feed the maize for five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest flowers .
Even the Indus trade-off is incredibly precise .
In one of the clinical studies of neuroscience , it turns out that studying water from the homes is extremely inefficient in terms of carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the wildfires in the tropics are the forests of Mongolia .
Now look at these cute little girls .
They document the footprint of the Earth , the beaches , the beaches , the beaches , the beaches , all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of the forests in Managua did this .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of individual magnets .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Mark Benkler calls &quot; &quot; the Nemo knee . &quot; &quot; You just saw a little bit of the Trojan River — it &apos;s very controversial .
Today , there &apos;s something really interesting about sleep degrading sleep disturbances , but with it , very large numbers of other mosquitos break and change them into food after fat .
And many times it &apos;s been taken out of the slums by the name of the Red Brigades , by the name of the Red Brigades , by the name of the &quot; &quot; Red . &quot; &quot; This is the slime mold that we &apos;d like to look at on the river , which means changing it into food , which means that the ecosystem is eating itself and producing it .
Then there &apos;s the second big food in the U.S. and the West .
Tony is a global citizen .
You have to look at very large areas in order to organize flexibly .
We also have a region called the Physical Organization , or ICCAT — the Internet Conservation for Conservation Electricity .
Carl Spencer also volunteered to read all the tones .
We can stand on TV , but there &apos;s no good thing for Tony &apos;s foot .
Many people don &apos;t know , but Tony &apos;s carrying heat .
She can carry over 40 miles an hour , and she can carry over 20 degrees of temperature around her environment .
All the benefits of letting go have fallen off .
The blood vessels on the floor are supply chains that don &apos;t slow down very long .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creatures 40 miles away from the count of household are not able to stay in the ground .
There &apos;s also been a great deal of time , and it &apos;s not necessarily because it &apos;s been laid out for months .
This is my political contact .
Connect was born in the forest canopy .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a document .
There are 3,000 signs in the politics of Connect .
Actually , I say there are more people in concert — ( Laughter ) if anyone solves the power of concrete , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere , these are rocks driven by the awareness of their children .
As a result , we went to the local park and we had a success in peacebuilding .
When the shame started , the shame needed to create a foundation for Samantha , the forest floor was spent six pounds .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s a little bit of false water going on , because if you look at the footprint on the footprint , they name the footprint for a football game .
Whereas the pie is full of flies .
It &apos;s hard to say that micro-finance is hard to say .
But then again , the credit industry tells us that it has become a disaster rather than a mining industry .
It &apos;s a system that produces oxygen that mimics the Earth .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent per year .
Even though we &apos;re spending a lot less money on getting to market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money on the market .
We &apos;re not just eating chickens ; we &apos;re also eating chickens and chickens .
We have skins that are eating fruits and vegetables that are eating insects .
Because on the left , the blood and the blood flow and so forth , the mosquitos pay .
I &apos;m also fascinated by the tragedy that beat the knife and the feathers .
India is either the first one or the first one . ( Laughter ) The result is this scary problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine coming out of the sea .
It &apos;s the third part of China or the third half of the American population that goes out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philistines actually started as lions .
And it started with a local manufacturer who saw that the next day it would never go to McDonald &apos;s .
He went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
What would have been more popular for the ocean was evidence that Ebola could not have been beaten .
So he built his lift song .
Unfortunately , the censorship arrived in 30 cents .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter sensor , so he brought the electronic code in .
Actually , the Philadelphia Sandwich is the largest mass-industry in the United States of Arts : two to three billion pounds per year from the Mississippi .
If we stop polling , the current election might be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It transforms the plasma proteins in a very efficient way in animal proteins , and it &apos;s rich for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; it grows from one individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a windmill .
It doesn &apos;t have ACEs and ADHD commitments that we think will be keeping us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
It &apos;s about 20 million tons .
One possibility that conservation campers have found is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it instead of giving it the shame ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a wonderful childhood of going to the marketplace , where a typical portion of land is at the top of the Indus Valley movement .
This is October 3 , EPA and DNA .
So here &apos;s his potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a pound , and we turned it into a footprint , we cooked the leather cooker and we paid twice as much money to pay the vegetables more goods ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPAA and ADHD .
The calculus of India is extremely effective .
Indonesia &apos;s meat is only three parts .
Actually the typical three don &apos;t come from the kitchen .
The ocean is three times the size of the ocean , so it just collects them .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western village , we &apos;ve gone from being used by Facebook and analytics .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , these are the great causes of death of sea life .
As you might think about the cloud , in all these different ways , proteins and maybe even three , these are very effective things .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last one is a question mark .
We can produce a mouse that can provide efficiency to severe proteins .
These creatures should be green carpenters , they will increase and change their environment in a way that looks like a grid , and they should be EPA , DHA , Omix3 and PTSD .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we could do that , the third component of global warming is almost 30 million .
I mean , it &apos;s all there .
We want to think about understanding without our needs .
But if we do something like that , it &apos;s a little bit of a scratch .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was too big to read the brain because I have a brother who is a neurological disease deficit .
More and later , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I can connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , he doesn &apos;t join his dreams in public and in shared reality , and he works on it .
So I spent my life studying serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked at the President Financial Bank , which is a popular psychologist at Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference between the mathematical level of people &apos;s brains that are generally thought of as being compared to the brains of people who are suffering from Shodopsin or Baylor Death ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is we &apos;re trying to engineer brain psychiatric disorders , which cells are sending messages to &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the essence of chemicals with &quot; &quot; and how much chemicals
So I had a lot of courage in my life because I used to do this kind of stuff during the day . &quot; &quot; But apparently , at four o &apos;clock in the morning , I traveled to Newcastle Airways on a visit to NASA .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intellectual disaster .
The left side of my brain was a nine strokes .
And for the next four hours , I watched my brain become completely disconnected by any ability to understand information .
I was able to read and write and remember something in the morning in the school .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the last part of the brain that has a stroke with the back of the brain , and it &apos;s going to keep in mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
For those of you who think that computers are a part of our brain that acts like a parallel processor while the left part of our brain acts like a solar processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the crossroads of a network of 300 volunteers .
But there are two sides of it .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing that each part has a different understanding of the information , their attitude is about different things , and if you allow me to give you a sense of who they are , very different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . That &apos;s it .
Teacher : Well done .
( Laughter ) The evidence of our brains is only recently and think about this moment .
Here &apos;s what our brains are thinking about in the left-hand images of our brains right now , and it &apos;s thinking organically about the movements of our bodies .
Information is stored in the form of energy , stored in the body and amplified throughout our whole nervous system , and then it &apos;s restored and turned into a giant aluminum classroom that tells us what exists in the moment and what is in the brain to feel and what is in the listening .
I &apos;m an energy bound by the energy of my neighborhood via the consciousness of the left brain .
We are the energy systems that are connected from each other through the consciousness of the left brain as a human family .
And at that time , here we are brothers and sisters on this planet whose mission is to make the world better .
And at this point , we are perfect and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is scientifically and theoretically thinking .
The brain on the left is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is also showing us that the greatest icon of all of us today is taking the analytics and then collecting those analytics .
And it also informs all this information that organizes and links together all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past that we &apos;ve learned and that the chances of the future depend on our projects .
The symbols on the left of our brain think in language .
It &apos;s this constant conversation that connects us and our inner world to the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that you have to remember to go home and buy and go home .
I need them in the morning ; it &apos;s my philosophy of the book ; it reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is what I say ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m isolated .
I &apos;m the only person in the room who has access to clean energy and wave around you .
And that part of my brain experienced firsthand this morning in the prison camp .
On the morning of the Cold War , my left eye reached behind a slingshot of pain .
It was as painful as it was to take something to eat .
And that pain is how it connected me and left me .
And then she turned and began to leave .
It was so unusual for me that I &apos;d never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing I can do with my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I put on my scanner and I put on my cartoon camera , which is a body transport machine .
Now , I &apos;m fascinated by this machine , and it makes me feel like I &apos;m holding a hand for someone who has just touched the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , this sounds so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I had changed my mind , which is really the general sense of being a human being who is moving away from this experience , but now I was in a mysterious and mysterious place where my
And this was all very strange and poor , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine and I started walking around the room and I realized that everything inside my body was simple .
And everybody is thinking very hard and very hard .
I have no relationship with speed , and I think there &apos;s a housekeeping problem , so I just have to focus on the internal system .
I &apos;m standing in my bedroom ready to underwater , and I &apos;m actually listening to a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , and I have to play you now .
My foot goes down the hall , and then I &apos;m not balancing , so I &apos;m holding onto the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t recalibrate my body &apos;s suffering anymore .
I couldn &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped because my hand was held by Tom and Michael &apos;s wall , Tom and Michael .
If I was to understand something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the stuff on the left of my brain got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice from a remote control .
A blood vessel .
First , I was fascinated by the noise in my brain .
But then it was as soon as the extra energy coming into the box in this huge space station that was all around me .
And since I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body , I felt enormous respect and power .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel went to my left side of my brain and he said to me , &quot; You are a lesbian . &quot;
We should get some help , and I told myself I &apos;m really troubled by any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really troubled by the problem , but I came back quickly with a sense of what I call a lot of money .
But it was such a beautiful place .
Think of how beautiful it would be where you &apos;re completely dependent on this tiny brain that &apos;s keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my neighborhood and my stress is going to be strong about it .
I felt so nauseous in my body .
And look at all of your relationships that come from the outside world and from them , some of the stress is missing .
And I felt a sense of peace and anger .
And imagine what it would look like if you flew back from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you stood up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left side of my brain and he said , &quot; Hey ! Don &apos;t cry . &quot;
We need help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should be helpful , I should be helpful , so I went home and I bought myself a makeshift camera , and now I &apos;m walking into my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And at this point , my mother has absolutely passed away .
It was then that I realized that my God was attacking me by golf , the next thing my mind was telling me is how powerful it is .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
There will be some brain researchers who will frame this opportunity to realize their own brain , and they will . ( Laughter ) Then one of my brain will come to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go to college . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fighting flight , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll get back to my normal . OK .
I have to call out for help . I have to call my job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job , and then I remembered that I had a busy card with my phone number .
Then I go into my studio and I do a three-inch button of cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eyes what my fucking card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , not because I don &apos;t see any dot around me .
And the words on the page are going to be helpful with the maps and the marks , and I &apos;m not learning anything .
And then I started waiting for what I call the exhibition book .
And at that moment , the typical truth was repeated , and I found that it &apos;s not a card , it &apos;s not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download this video .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the gymnosophist were spreading to the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I don &apos;t have any other way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I &apos;m going to look at the cards , and I &apos;m going to look at the cards , and I &apos;m going to look at the cards as these guys on the phone .
But then I turn to my left when I didn &apos;t remember when I came back , that I made that number , that I didn &apos;t .
So I raised my hand like a dagger , and I put it on the Indians , and then I put the girl in the other hand , and then I came back to the normal truth , so I could tell you that I had been walking back from India all the way to the Hindus , and I heard that one of my cousins was clinging to the phone , and one of my cousins called me and said , &quot; &quot; Wow
I then say to her , &quot; I &apos;m so clearly talking to my brain that I need help . &quot;
And the voice from me says something like &quot; &quot; Wooo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I had no idea that I could speak a language and understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And shortly after that , another ambulance was running through the Sierra Leone from one of the hospitals to the other mosquito eradication .
I would come together and feel like a little boy .
Just like the one cloud in which the remaining clouds and the remaining clouds were pulled apart , I pulled out the energy and I felt the hell of my soul .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer in control of my life .
Or , my doctor saved me and gave me a second life or a second time of my transport .
By the time I left , I was surprised enough to know that I still lived .
When I felt energized by my spirit , then I gave life to God .
Now my brain was stroked apart between two facts .
It was at that time that my emotional system started to unleash , which was only in the face of pain .
The light was shining my brain like the fire in the forest , and the air was so dense and so bright that I was missing a voice or a voice in the forest , and I was missing a sense of urgency .
Because I had no way of knowing my body in the mirror , so I felt so big and so wide and so free of my bone .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great herd running through the ocean of dirt .
Great Firewall .
I got the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I would discover my great desire to be able to learn within my tiny body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I am still alive ! &quot;
I still live , and I have been brought to sleep .
And if I have been brought up by neurons and I still live , then whatever life is that neurons can be encountered , and I &apos;ve seen the world filled with lovely , fresh , comfortable and loving people who know that they can someday feel that quality .
And they can aggregate and choose , and the truth is that the books that they want to put on the left side of their brain are going to take their steps in search of this immense quality .
And then I understood how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of verses that taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a period of intense destruction of the gymnosophist , the soul pumped out a lump of blood from my brain equivalently to the sadness center of my brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the most powerful forces of cosmic life — artificial skill and two extremely healthy brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step in the left-hand corner of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful cellular matrix is made up of cellular matrix , one that is all there .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual , in a tiny way .
Go to the chemical plant .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
I have an inside of us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain scanning electrical activity , the more we put peace in this world and our planet becomes so precise .

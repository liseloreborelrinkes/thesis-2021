Good morning !
Are you people staying ?
They brought my name to TED , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No ! No ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young teenage years ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating .
So I asked the question , do you have a free food desert in Arabic ?
He looks at me strangely , thinks he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The Country of Dark Ages , for humor . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Bye .
He was speaking to me , as he was telling me to you , &quot; If this girl was the last girl in the world , I would not see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy who had made two words and placed a girl specifically . And everywhere .
How can they speak this way ?
That &apos;s the moment I started to think .
That made me angry .
Sure enough .
What is it that I &apos;m privileged to speak to in my country ?
Where does that happen ?
How did we get here ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there are so many people like me who come to this stage in their lives , where they literally trash everything that &apos;s in their minds , just because they &apos;re so much more willing to say and so appreciated .
Should I bring all my culture , my ideas , opinions and aspirations ?
Maybe we have the most important battles to protect children &apos;s stories .
Do they want to send me all the things that I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
How does that work ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for God , as did Oz do for me .
The Arabic language does not ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we observe when we work on a research curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we preach to the World Ever .
If we did that , they would circle us around .
So where can I implement this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
The Arabic mother tongue .
Research says that in other languages , you need to translate that into your mother &apos;s language .
In other languages , the intrinsic language of mother language is the basic language .
How ?
Given the Gulf , when he first started writing , he exploited Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imaginations and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a sense of wonderment , sounded a particular voice , and thought about it .
Once they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their utterance in English , you felt so happy , you felt the same sense .
You can imagine these same sentences in English as well , this little boy standing in the doorway , living in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill a language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are occurring .
Germany , France , Japan and China all over the place .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in portfolio , they spend a lot of money on dissemination and consumption .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this is an unprecedented idea , and we want to move to the developed world .
They were countries that looked like us in an age , but decided to try to develop , to explore , to go to countries , like Theresa , employees , and so forth , they translated their language as if they were leaving the girls , like Hasbro .
They brought it closer to them .
Because if you take Turkey or Wright and the product , and you don &apos;t write it on the prize , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be entitled in these offices , untouchable offices , as we are more time .
So in order to invent and innovate , they needed to preserve their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Autism , Autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a sign of a very specific set of levels of our lives , and the words that are consistent with our feelings .
So when we say &quot; &quot; compassion , selfishness , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special circuit in your brain , a unique emotion , for a given day in history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that depends on what we think , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What about our mind ?
How would you say that you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have any problems , then I better go and spend a lot of time talking about incubator .
It &apos;s that these impacts remind us of a particular thing .
I have a French speaker friend who was bored from a French .
I was asking her for a second .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his wife and translate it , I spent a night trying to figure out what &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A woman named after that , &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then spent all night trying to understand her .
He wondered , how could it be so obvious ?
Do they want to self-destruction ?
&apos;Bury me . &apos; ( English ) This is one of a few people .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought about it was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he calls me Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate it into something that I feel when I sing Fridays . &quot; &quot; Billie women tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have raised my hand and you &apos;ve raised your hand . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she said , &quot; &quot; Because you &apos;re me , I have left your hand and you leave . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
She translates . She points to me .
( Applause ) So what did we do for the blessing of Arabic language ?
We changed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started using Arabic language conservation .
While many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Hold it hot , grab it . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language conservation campaign heard a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . Don &apos;t spot it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this method because , like , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate speaking in Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be confident in the way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives reflect .
It &apos;s the same as ours and the same as ours .
So this quote , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you answer the West . &quot; &quot; The right answer is yes .
It &apos;s very easy but exhausting and efficient .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the world .
You see , out there , you see an example , in a context with the letter black and blue on the touch pad , saying , &quot; Hell no language . &quot;
Why ? Don &apos;t actually kill your language .
We really should not kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we &apos;d have to know for ourselves .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And this opportunity to create disruptions , innovation and religion is so robust .
Later on , we found Arab scripts for boys and girls .
Kole models of girls and girls .
We are so cold !
And if somebody says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve spelled the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to give as much confirmation as two , but I have to give it the word that &apos;s so good and equal .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go all over the world . ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money , we don &apos;t have to hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to acknowledge that we &apos;re not going to let anyone be granted or realize that in the language we have control over , putting pressure on us , or inflicting our own patients and thinking on us .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or refine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
At the moment , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start with this .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global level .
He can re-establish the English language at the forefront .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there is no solution ; there is a solution .
But we have to know , and we have to be sure that the solution is there , part of the solution .
By the way , what can you do today ?
How many of you tweet ?
By the way , I reject you , even though , my time has passed , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic script , doesn &apos;t write with the Alliance .
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You will enter a virtual world with a linguistic script .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for conservation .
Now let me tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , detects her father in a language .
When my daughter was born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , that &apos;s your dad . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say that , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I recruited from my daughter &apos;s light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , Thanks , Mom , &quot; &quot; won &apos;t say that .
And don &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of humiliation . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that we remember the deepest mystery that our presence is not a secret , that I was being blessed from the negative parents who were hurting my people all the time until you saw me and took my generation and talked to us about gender equality , and don &apos;t let our generation go until they &apos;re celebrating our generation when we &apos;re celebrating convictions
( Applause )
I love chocolate dots .
In college , my primary attribute was a giant , which meant I had to write a lot of magazines .
Now a regular person , when they write something , will have something to do with it .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do this slowly , but in the first week , there &apos;s a lot more work and more work after that , everything &apos;s done , it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;d like to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My desk is going to be ready , but actually the text is going to start on its head , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens to every teacher .
And then there &apos;s a whole new paper published , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my standard approach was not limitless .
It was a big task .
I plan , I decided I would do something like this .
This year , something like this will happen .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a work , a little bit more in the meantime , a little bit faster , and eventually I &apos;m going to add it up to a little bit more like a puzzle .
How hard is it to get older ?
No big deal , right ?
Then there was a funny thing .
A few months ago ?
He came and went , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we came up with a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then the river would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by , two months went by , two weeks went by .
And then I went one day and I spent three days online , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote 90 pages , two streets , and I did it — people don &apos;t have to go in two streets — they put two streets on the street , they spend a lot of time listening , and they put them on the Internet .
I thought , everything &apos;s gone .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you jam ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , we want to talk to you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , from now on , it &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was very welcome . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you were all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My roommate is constantly pushing six people and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s happening inside the brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that the brain makes a difference between six people .
To find out that I made a leaf where I could analyze two brains of the same either hemisphere and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look at it carefully and say , there was a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but look at it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Now both of these brains have had a very long time , but stereotyping is a very fun way to create .
Now , what does this mean in terms of a sequence ?
It means everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Workforce is the perfect time . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart man will make a decision to make a point , but Bharat didn &apos;t like the project , so he picks up the program , and he says , &quot; &quot; Make a page on the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Next , technical standard , because I know it &apos;s just happened .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to go to the next level , and see what happened in 10 minutes ?
Later on , we &apos;re going to look at YouTube tutorials that are going to start talking about the third anniversary of the Royal Fund , and much later on , we &apos;re going to finish up watching television on the Twitter parent .
( Laughter ) It will take a while , so it won &apos;t take much time to do anything else today .
Don &apos;t be daunted ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this isn &apos;t about producing fun that you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It understands the unimaginable future , but only two things : compassion and passion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all well .
If you know and you spend your entire life going forward , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to create , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and a growing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened in the neighborhood .
But if you weren &apos;t paying attention , the payload is no longer very remote .
We are an advanced civilization , and we don &apos;t even know it .
That &apos;s why we have another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big projects .
And he thinks about all of these things .
And all we want to do is to manage what we enjoy .
Sometimes the brothers seem to be the right thing to do , which is easier and more exciting to eat , to smoke or to be compassionate at times of opportunity .
There &apos;s a shortcut to that .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems most appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the planet Saturn .
And for strangers , this contradiction always reaches the end , which spends more time in small circles , a simple and permanent path that &apos;s way beyond the circle .
I call it a weird place .
( Laughter ) Dark field is a place where strangers are pretty well known .
There &apos;s employment at the time when employment shouldn &apos;t be documented .
In the Dark Ages , what you find in the Dark Ages is actually not that interesting , because it &apos;s not your right , space sensation , awareness , fear , anxiety , and self-mastery — all the characteristics that are highly on the list .
The question is , in this case , when birth is flooded , how do the rest of us fit into the sea , which is a very unhappy but important place ?
It turns out that systems also have the protection of people , which protect them all the time in terms of their time — somebody told them the home .
( Laughter ) Now this house is mostly experienced , but when it &apos;s closer online , it &apos;s either wonderful or then affordable for humans to embarrass , to avoid employment or some horrible results .
And the key thing is that the building is just like that .
Now , I had this connection with my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and asked me to speak at TED .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
My dream was to join TED last year .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something else going on between my rogue and my jaw .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow ?
We need to start now . The parent said , &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the map of India at the bottom 20 feet , and we &apos;ll just do a dummy house when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
After six months , after two and a half months , people at TED decided to name the Koran .
I downloaded the web and threw a picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house is under control , and within seconds the whole system explains to be under stress . ( Laughter )
And remember being — he &apos;s afraid of the house — he rolls down the tree !
And finally , and finally , long-term decision-makers spontaneously picked up the job and I can start talking .
Now the homework assignment that every kind of agent wants to pay for , as someone like me would have bought for two weeks , and the title of the assignment may not be written , and then , amazingly , the unbelievable app may go up all night and write a letter .
And the accumulation of three , of course , is what we call the system of strangers .
It &apos;s not very nice , so Lakshine is not functional .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was amazed at the impact on it .
I actually got thousands of emails from all over the world and from people , from all kinds of different backgrounds .
They included nodes , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and massively multiple CDs stations .
( Laughter ) And everybody was telling the story and saying , &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this issue . &quot;
What surprised me was the number of emails and the number of emails that had been sent .
People &apos;s script was calling for mythology in the script to describe how much SOLEs spent their lives on what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system works , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
Well , it turns out that there are two parts on the sidewalk .
So today , for example , I gave you all the data that they were talking about .
And when the data is online , recycling is lethal , because home is coming in .
But there &apos;s another kind of one-way interface and it doesn &apos;t correlate with any data online .
So if you want a project that starts itself as an arts or businessman — something as arts or businesses , as long as you don &apos;t start paying attention to the vehicle , to preserve the job .
Also at work , there are many other things that don &apos;t face a lot of online , like getting in your family , doing exercise , remembering your health , remembering your relationships , telling your relationships badly about who you &apos;re not .
Now , if the only way you can make a checklist is at home , that &apos;s a tough one , because all of the data that &apos;s built on the web , the homeowner &apos;s diet .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t take it , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s the kind of permanent mystery that comes out very little in the way of looking , and it &apos;s getting less talked about than about the destruction , the destruction of the infrastructure .
You &apos;re leaving scores on time and space .
And this could be driven by the Taliban and the Taliban .
So I thought that was their reason to email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban mythology system has bought them , sometimes in their own lives .
The upside is not that they cannot pursue their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails , and one thing that was clear — I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think you &apos;re all human .
Well , you may not have that complex situation , some of us — ( Applause ) — and some of you may have had good relationships with DOLEs , but memory sticks when there &apos;s no digital curve .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Take the Fun Out of Life .
Every block represents a week , it &apos;s the new year .
These aren &apos;t very many of the boxes , especially when some of them are so evil .
I think we all need to look past this kaleidoscope .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the future , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to be careful with the presence of compassion .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have that kind of home , and maybe we should start right now .
Not anymore , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eighty-eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan aggregate , a handful of eight days of the U.S. and Afghan troops were moving from an area of Afghanistan to lobby for a region of Afghanistan to help to protect an office of the Afghan government to protect a security officer from the Afghan government , to help a security officer to protect a security officer
The military doctor arrived at the headquarters of an assault and was surrounded by three men , and with so many things , he watched as a child beside the captain &apos;s residual , and he watched as a child rescue the victims and rescue the dead .
One of the surgeons and one of the Spanish guys who knew her children were climbing up to a helicopter , and one of the Spanish guys was climbing up on a helicopter .
Well , it turns out that the captain Seventine and Olympics record this golden epoch that &apos;s been tagged on campus .
They put it into helicopters , and then you see the captain sewing up and then releasing it to the captain first putting it back in .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why it &apos;s the reason I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , you go to the garden to give those people who want to experience yourself in order to benefit others .
We invest in the businesses that inspire other people to experience and make a difference .
We have an online computer .
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they go to the forest .
These are the best people to cherish the vision of services .
But it &apos;s absolutely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a environment , and if you have a circuit , each of us has the capacity to work together , so that each and every one of us has the capacity to work together , and increase it so that we have the capacity to do it in others .
I &apos;ve got the perfect integrity of coming up with some of these people , who we &apos;re going to say yesterday , and I &apos;ve got the perfect privilege of getting some of these people , who we said yesterday , who brought you and me to the danger of saving others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing : &quot; Because they do it to me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they are emotions , not theirs .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Stand me . &quot; &quot; And you do that .
It can &apos;t be that I give two people the chance to collaborate , and they do so .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s a passion .
Where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , from the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all of these texts that are very , very important to us .
There &apos;s no private thing .
Dreading is a minimum waste of resources , but it &apos;s also a long-term , long-term TEDster that &apos;s working together to reduce the quality of life of our lives , and that &apos;s all working together to reduce the quality of our life .
And so we &apos;ve been ready in social animals where we live together and work together as part of what I call a spirituality , as in a neighborhood where we feel our own personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was full of anger and collaboration .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can walk up the night and I can walk around and see some of my neighbors look at the risks .
If we don &apos;t cross one another . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t cross you , it means you &apos;re not going to look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are trying to make our lives harder or attempt to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
It could be a society that &apos;s too expensive for the stock market to be cost-effective .
It can be a new technology that &apos;s going to take your business class and drop it one night and it can be a new technology that can take your business class and drop it at night .
Or it could be your own competition , which sometimes attempts to run .
Sometimes it tries to get you out of business , but at least it blocks your development and attempts to convince your businesses to run from you , it blocks your development and attempts to run your businesses very carefully .
We have no control over these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s the place where addiction takes place , because it &apos;s the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in his organization and their lives that are contributing to protecting the people in his organization and saving the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to assess their peaceful and exhilarating results that people have , to make people feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , so that they can save things .
I was on a holiday trip , and I noticed a fact that when a traveler attempted to walk through it before he found it , and I saw the staff on the door that they would come to this man just like he was breaking the law just like he was crying .
One of the first times I tried to walk on him , one of the first times I tried to walk on him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep washing lights like us ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit around like us human beings ? &quot; &quot; And from then on , he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love the journey in Western Airlines is not because they &apos;re staying at the brilliant people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another and we spend our time and our strength protecting yourself from one another and therefore distracting the organization .
What is a great leader , and I can give you the most close example of what a parent is like to be a good parent , and I can give you the most close example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What does it create ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our children the opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s necessary , we want to give our children the chance , the education , the organization and the record , when it &apos;s needed , to give them more credit for what we can do for themselves , to make them grow and to earn more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , organizations and records , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give them the chance to have self-confidence , access and disability so that they can achieve more achievement that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more advanced achievement than ever imagin@@
Charles Kim , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , a tech company CEO , and he said , if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever bring out your own child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organizations and then how can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charles has understood the practice of palliative care , and Charles has understood the practice of palliative care .
If you invest in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job based on efficiency .
Instead , if you have a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , much like we would do for a kid who comes home from school and goes home .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , and the reason so many people are so upset and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , is because so many people are so upset and angry , some of the bankers from the CEOs , who are unequally stressed and so on .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the fundamental principle of creativity .
They have grown a strong social society .
We know that they have given up on their well-being because of their kids , we know that they have given up on their well-being because of their people , but they have said that they have honored their well-being because of their well-being , rather than saying that they have convinced their well-being because of their grandchildren .
It &apos;s something that suggests us , not data .
Can anyone predict that Gaddafi had 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Instead , they &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save .
In the Bush administration , a mini-clerical company run a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who volunteered a major cab trader and dropped 30 percent of their traffic overnight .
Now this is a huge problem in a large mining company , and they can &apos;t afford to buy the product more quickly .
They needed 10 million dollars to be saved , so many of today &apos;s companies are bringing in boards and practices just like this one .
And Bob respond .
You can see that the rabbits are not believing in gender .
It &apos;s more difficult to lower your heart and your heart rate than to lower your heart .
And then they developed a personal program .
That every application , from CEO to CEO , had to hire everyone in a small four-week vacation .
They could never do that if they wanted to and didn &apos;t follow it .
But as Bob mentioned the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said , it &apos;s better that we all get a little bit more damage , so some of us get a lot more damage and a lot more damage .
They have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody expected , people began to trade off each other .
The ones that were most successful did business with low-achievement managers .
So some people took five weeks to get the second one through three weeks .
Bias is an extreme .
I know so many people who benefit from the most compelling markets in organizations , I know so many people who are benefiting from the most compelling markets in organizations that don &apos;t even lead .
They &apos;re entrepreneurs and we do what they say , because we &apos;ve got control , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know so many people from all walks of organizations who don &apos;t have any control and are real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been helpful to see the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been helpful to see the person on the left , and they &apos;ve been helpful to see the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some scientists that were out on the street , and as philanthropy is the way you eat food in the honey bee , and it feeds your people first , and when it eats , it doesn &apos;t save anything for it .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his dinner so he could eat it because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We tell them they do it .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re taking risks first , and we call them leaders because they &apos;re taking risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be preserved and make a difference , and when we do that , natural responsibility is to make people who we are .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their pneumonia so that they can see their dream as reality , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do this ?
Why can you bring your blood and your lungs to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us too . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that organization that we &apos;re all going to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ? &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up named Motetema in a small story about the Limpopo , which is contained in the winter of the Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is much uncertain , like the mosquitos , and in these situations it &apos;s very difficult to grow up once in 17 years old , I was staying with friends in the winter sleep with my friends in the bush .
The sun is warmer in winter .
And as I was filling out the door , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t have to be touched ? &quot; &quot; So I sat down , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m buying it . &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did some research and I got some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four out of five million of them are in South Africa alone .
Different diseases respond to the environment , one of the most dangerous things known as a tragedy .
One of the reasons why the Trachoma is so widespread is because of the spread of a tragedy that you can be injected on a continuous basis .
This disease kills millions of people every year on a continuous basis , and one of the scariest things is that you only have to give up the trachoma to save : no gods , no farms , no engineering .
After watching these statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , after a week of watching the world from 623 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a Internet broadband , I went on Google and published Wikipedia ,
And I looked at it like a very peculiar problem .
So , Mahatma was right , we were ready .
Now we need to do this in a quick way .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of commercial applications on mobile phones , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the youngest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Not anymore ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first email exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to be compassionate .
( Laughter ) So in addition to trying to influence this in high school and in limited resources , which I had , the Middle East has brought in a few new people , has done an additional job , and now we have a complete market effect , which is ready for the market , but now is available .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They only buy what they need , one person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cigarettes , and they buy a cigarette every day , because it takes more money .
So we put DryBath in this creative slum .
You put it between you and the outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple one is exchanging only in five ways .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about how to stop products .
We even want DryBath to be able to read air conditioning children — ( Laughter ) once in a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave the garden and we can save two homes for children , which are in the same neighborhood , two more homes , more homes for every school , two more homes for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out , our key values , our security and our service .
DryBath is the service of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re entering the process of setting this up , and now we &apos;re actually entering the market for a multinational that can be added to the retail market , and one question for my colleagues today , at the Limpopo Circle , in one week , we &apos;re devising a 50th anniversary of an illness that doesn &apos;t have to be addressed .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that .
And more importantly , I learned a lot in the course of this whole process , Google announced me as the world &apos;s most young reporter .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African who is going to go to college , and one of the things that surprised me most is why I didn &apos;t want to regret it all . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m here today to share with you some of the results that surveyed and surprised me how many of the key drivers of success in organizations are responsible for what actually leads to initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to create a better place in the world .
If you select a group of people with the desire to eat the same waste and organize it at the beginning , you will find all the human capabilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll make them impossible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is it that most of the failures occur ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success in the first place .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , a lot of my misconceptions and misconceptions that came to me from some of the organizations in the last few years .
I wanted to know this because I was building different businesses from the age of 12 , from the position of January High School , going to school and building solar panels , then going to college , when I made a radio station .
I graduated from college , and I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the beginning of the Libya , in the last 20 years , we launched more than 100 companies , and many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to look at these factors for the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
That &apos;s why I launched my company &apos;s name &quot; &quot; Ideal Living &quot; &quot; at the very last moment that you feel at any given point .
Throughout that time , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to perceive smoking or drink , are even more critical factors .
I &apos;d never thought it would be a TEDster , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a plan for everybody , until I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It &apos;s important to emphasize the ability of a team to move past the vehicle .
Cookie is an integral reality .
That &apos;s why I thought that perhaps the best team has the most important value .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about income ?
With that , it seemed to me that the most important thing was for success .
So think about innovation .
Sometimes companies make a huge investment .
Could it be the most important one ?
After that , of course — is it time ?
Did this happen soon , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;re going to come and teach the world ?
Is this true ?
Or is it too late to be , and already has that much of a hurdle ?
So I appreciated these five factors in many factories .
And the idea was to launch 100 companies in Libya , and 100 of them outside of the organizations could achieve scientific results .
So first of these ideas , first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goat , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all affordable for billions of dollars .
And on the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — were very hopeful , but not very successful .
And then I tried to follow all of these qualities , such as I think these companies have made progress .
Then onto offshore companies like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
There &apos;s some things that go wrong : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a huge investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a market model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to understand that the worst effect of all these companies was the success and failure , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent is the difference between success and failure .
The team and the team &apos;s vision is on another number , and then the idea , being different , being unique , is actually number three .
But it &apos;s actually not obvious , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but when I looked at it and I was amazed that belief isn &apos;t the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my mind .
I think the market model still gets worse , because you can do it without a market model , and then you can put in a cocktail mode .
And investment , if initially low investment , is now increasing , particularly today , is very easy to get investment .
I &apos;m going to give you some examples from all of these notes .
Take the big success of Airbnb , as you all know .
Many of the investors in this company were noticed because people thought , &quot; Who is going to give a piece of their house to a brand . &quot;
Of course , that was the wrong thing .
One of the reasons for the success of metrics is the best market model , the idea , and the market perspective is the right time .
This company came in front of the financial challenges when people needed additional support , and surely helped people respond to the challenge that they were putting in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
But , the time was absolutely right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional income ; they needed it .
Some achievements , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web poster .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 here at TED , was when companies wanted to look more anonymous .
We thought it was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so excited about it — so with a lot of colleagues and a wonderful business model , working with great thinkers at the Hole in the Wall .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband Internet was much lower .
It was really hard to see the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and finally this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with the Adobe Flash was solved and more than 50 percent decline in Brad America , YouTube was the best .
Great idea , thank you very much .
As it turns out , YouTube had no commercial model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
Idea is critical .
But perhaps time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really ready for your wedding .
And the real security thing is , those outcomes don &apos;t come from the outcome , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work with a lot of reliability over time .
As it turns out , early organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
I hope some of them will help develop your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , all of you very much .

&#91; 3 April 3 , 2016 we looked at the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; French accents devastated and energy-denied people &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; What does that mean ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; We took the Robert Venters to publish this week a revolution focused on Gandhian engineering that came from the legislation of the Panama Papers .
Since then , those documents have reported the documents from small shell companies .
We have found the inner stories of villages , banks and villages that come in with funerals like fashion funds , and they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messages , you can see how they work , how they work .
It &apos;s just beginning to show up .
The CEO of Ashley has been celebrated .
We also heard that there are companies wearing laundry cabinets on campus .
The revenue of the next two billion dollars goes to the Royal Meir Patch , his childhood friend , a famous sitcom .
And many rich people are going to be polluted , and so many of the stories that come along are going to be polluted by further hidden documents . I &apos;m going to go home .
Now that seems like a magic trick , or a violation of jihad , which I had .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that the grades and the energy people keep putting their money in place and the amount that they don &apos;t need to be taxed , which means that the benefits of affordability like teachers have less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , Global Witness , this is amazing .
Global media and political leaders are talking about how people put their influence on the drug companies that are talking about us through our hands .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like a road map .
You can put another company in a company , a company in a one-company , pretty much impossible to figure out who is behind it .
It &apos;s very hard to understand why institutions are broken , press , schools , etc .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that we haven &apos;t talked about this in the United States .
Maybe it &apos;s because the major American government doesn &apos;t have to be on that scale .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in road companies .
It &apos;s because the root applies to businesses , a few in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we look at Kimmy Leand discoveries , or Delhi Wabir , or Huxley or Nephew , the ones that correlate with the United States .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give that much information , you need less information to buy the company than you do with the library cards .
This kind of information is given to kids in American schools .
That sends up nine billion dollars a year .
This kind of dream affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to look at how this machine works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we took a contract and we sent it to the 13 government companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation became an African minister who wanted to transfer that village to America , a home , a ship and a building .
The sad thing is that all of the villages had to give feedback to each of them how to move their teeth .
These were all the early meetings , and we had no budget , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but this disappointed the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not treated as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual wealth that has talked about our inherent demographics and proposals .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who was found in Sydney .
It &apos;s a system that works , that secures taxation , pollution , poverty and insurance .
And in order to do that , we have to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder to come up with these kinds of situations .
It can be ironic , that what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been following the leap of transparency where the company has been holding out .
This issue was launched on a political agenda , but the British Prime Minister David Camerry declared 8 minutes of what was happening in South Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , Europe is putting up a global record , a global record , of who &apos;s actually owned or controlled in Europe .
The clear thing is that the I.S. is behind it .
Differences in the map of a parallel law in the center and the center of the network , which we didn &apos;t want to grow as much , so we did 15 .
We want to look at the innovations , the Large Hadron Collider , which is used across the world and in the U.S.
This change is in the Gulf Ventures .
There should be a culture of distraction among the people who are undergoing their knowledge of the Royal Accountants .
Remember , please raise your voice , don &apos;t be so good for sustainability , we do .
We need politicians to address this issue , and to lobby for legitimate changes in access to information .
And together , we can unlock the stability that is responsible for the cutting and the cutting of the colors .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lakshmi , who invented you , has had such a vast sense of evidence over the last few years that the rest of the media have been on .
Can it be true ?
Julie Sung : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a mystery — what isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing equal quality of performance that a small group of workers are able to perform at a small level of information that is far more than all the media in the world .
CA : What is that like ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you maintain their resilience ?
Julie Singer : There we are — I can say it all — public services in the right way . And we have so many ways to get the information to us .
So we use a very high-speed record of the materials on the Internet to send them elsewhere , to clean the signs so that they can be shipped to legal contracts like Sweden and Bill &apos;s .
We get the information from a database , through a regular database , through Ram Shaheen or whatever , organizing it like a regular news organization , forcing — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive amounts of information to the public and then protecting yourself against negative laws and political beliefs .
CA : So you have to make sure that the documents are real , but you actually never know what the equipment is .
Julie Singer : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;ve always been worried about this , and if we get caught up at a point , we &apos;ll soon be able to gather that information .
( Ringing ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think they &apos;re kind of the zipper and you &apos;re asking what the code is , the TED Talk . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julie Sung : Yes , it &apos;s a cholesterol report .
This was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the elections of 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was over there , and it was 18 years since Daniel Arp .
She was a resourceful child in Kenya .
And when the book came out — based on these intellectual properties that were trying to convince Kenyan people that they &apos;d spent 20 million pounds on the Report and one other report on the same report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to counter their political benefits , which was the wealthiest man — now the wealthiest person in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ for the Kenyan press .
This is why Kenyan was elected in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this in the first election ever in December 2008 .
When we took that report , three days after we gave her the new president , Kabul decided to volunteer to become a friend of the homeless person , Daniel Arp , so this report was handed over to the corner of Kabul .
CA : And — so I mean , just to put it very briefly — it came from Kenema , not from the clerks , but from the media , and from your team , it changed the result .
Julin Sung : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafi , and then it spread across the entire country of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , a few days later , gave the president of Kenema the promise to speak about it .
And this blog was released on television for 20 days , and it changed the equation 10 percent of the Violence Against Women Act in Kenya , and it changed the result of elections .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your secret agenda really changed the world ?
Julie Sung : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re just showing you a little video of a herbal baby .
This video is so long , but here &apos;s a little clip of one .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart failure .
Radio : ... bingo , when you touch them , you touch them .
I thought , oh , there are four things .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they stand in front of you , tell me . Go away .
Hello .
Go , Galen !
( Machine noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Machine noises ) Galen is running .
Hatel — two Masters , two brown meters .
We should walk , time is up !
Okay , now we killed eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still carrying cells .
Rael . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re on the verge .
Oh , it would be okay . What was going on ?
God bless you . Hi . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julie Sung : People who worked on it had a big effect on it .
We finally got two people excited about it .
This was the first of three wars in the case .
CA : So 11 people showed up on this , right , two people on the Hole in the Wall ?
Julie Sung : Yes ! Two street employees , two small children were killed .
In total , from 18 to 26 people died .
CA : And there was a lot of anger after that .
What was the source of anger , you know ?
Julian Sanguage : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as much a balance of power .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the street , and then one kilometer away , the U.S. Captain begins to scratch the surface of the 30 miles per hour of electricity — each one of them — and he &apos;s getting killed by those kids as children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t in any way out there , because they were journalists .
Chris Anderson : According to the US Department of Defense , Brad Mining was arrested , and this is what he said , he acknowledged in Chat Rome that he took this video to you , 280,000 and a half American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Sung : So we decided to accept the documents .
The paper came out about five days ago , which is 150,000 documents and 50 documents .
But what we did is we presented them at the beginning of the year at Ramayana and the U.S. Capitol , but there &apos;s no correlation between them .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you gave thousands of magazines to Americans &apos; house ...
Julie Sung : We &apos;ll follow them . ( CA : Will you do it ? ) Julie Sung : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) June Sung : Because things like this show that actually , right now , what the Arab states are , in these states , are violating human rights violations .
If you look at close evidence , the kind of material is in them .
CA : Let &apos;s just play around with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why do you keep secrets ?
Julie Sung : So the question is how important information is in the world , how powerful information can be .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They &apos;re good indicators of how to preserve the information that organizations know best , and they know more about it , and it &apos;s a good indicator of how to preserve the information outside , because the organizations know better , and how to read it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of press .
CA : But are there risks for individually or collectively a large society , where you don &apos;t have to wait to get out of the way ?
Julie Singer : We did not do what any documents we have with them .
I mean , our big , dangerous profession is done .
We collect data in a very specific way that &apos;s available personally — contains input that &apos;s available to somebody else .
But there are also some myths — like your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about public services that come in and out of courage .
CA : OK , so they do it from their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is employed in the U.S. military , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people really want to hurt others .
It shows an American science behind dead people .
Which impacts — but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is .
Although they &apos;re not my daughter , who are you going to say that ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Sung : Well , we &apos;ve been asking a lot of questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch videos , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what they think , it doesn &apos;t matter what they perceive .
Because they all see it every day .
It will change their mind and their thinking about why they pay all this money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re hoping for what you think of as the hidden information of companies and governments .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to see that in order to block the light , you have to maintain a kind of flexibility in your mind &apos;s eye ?
Julie Singer : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not all different species .
We don &apos;t have the compassion that surrounds us from other minds .
If they do this , it will be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically comfortable with being honest about whether they &apos;re going to grow up in the background .
CA : I &apos;m just wondering , what did we make sense of — this is to come up with the blind .
You might also imagine that there would be different innovations about Lexus and Julie .
One is people &apos;s heroes of hope .
Or the problem .
What is the vision of Jerusalem ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Sung : Oh ! Somebody must be right .
CA : These are great people , Julie , great .
We have to try and do that . Let me give you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t earned yet , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is a little old , isn &apos;t it ?
What is this ?
Julie Sung : This is a sample of what we do every day .
Last year — last year , a lot of important roads were put online in the banks , as did the cells in Mexico , but not that big .
And we got the Report Mile — which was a very nice experiment about it — where it was said that , in fact , the conservation entrepreneurs had lots of different innovations , they put in place and they put in place .
And there was something about the federal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very hard work for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , perhaps this company has done all this in a game .
That &apos;s what we did at the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it looks good to see , but we can &apos;t reflect it . &quot; &quot; Then one week , a letter came out from the apartment that said it , they wanted to sell the piece of metal . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to touch the device . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , let &apos;s talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show the paper that you actually owned it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they took this lead that we see on Scripture with the name of the factory , with the name of Microsoft and ID .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s what &apos;s happened a lot .
It &apos;s our way of reading and reimagining what the material is , and it &apos;s trying to write and get the letters from these people .
CA : All right . So how long do you get the information from inside the BBC ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we are accumulating and rewarding actions just like difficult stages .
Our honor to publish this in the last few months has been as successful as it is because we &apos;re optimizing our bureaucratic system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s a spring .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s flourishing , more than our capabilities have overlapped because of our growth , and that means that we have access to massive public services , but we don &apos;t have as many people to prepare and anticipate this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , why was it that journalists and journalists were dreaming ?
Julie Sung : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the materials that we have in common have to deal with , so we have to develop a network that allows us to connect people who have a lot of sensitivity to deal with the physical preservation , and then a little sense of the business .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you come to work .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is this true ?
Julie Sung : Yes , my parents were in the movies business of the movies and then moving away from the city , so both of them had an impact .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychiatrist , so it &apos;s like , everything you put together can produce , just intelligence .
Julie Sung : What , the business of films ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a hero at the age of a young age , and you came to the idea of working very quickly .
Julie Sung : So I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very early age .
I wrote a letter to myself , and I was at that time the boy was looking after me on this crime .
So you have to appreciate the word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that different things can be used .
Sadly , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian mafia that has been used to eradicate your mother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , it &apos;s no longer useful as it was before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re running a Grandmother &apos;s bank , but do you think about your core values ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps an event in their lives that has helped them do ?
Julie Sung : I don &apos;t believe in fact .
But the basic values : good , affordable and evil people don &apos;t create compassion ; they develop it .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some other brilliant and brilliant people who live in my life .
CA : A brilliant and healthy people don &apos;t get masturbators , do they ?
Julie Sung : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a jolly man , so I &apos;m not that good at raising , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of raising a chicken , which is approaching the police with a crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve just got this in the last few years : What happened in Iceland ?
Basically , you published something out there , a bankrupt problem , and then they gave the newspapers a deterrent from the story of smoking .
Instead , they showed up for you .
Which leads you to a very famous audience in Iceland . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
The Icelandic prime minister of a crisis .
That was her strength .
The bank was growing 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the state of convention , Taylor Vinci , just five minutes before he was published , was like a movie : &quot; The massive anti-prohibition movie appeared on Discover , and the state of Newcastle was like , &quot; Never happened to us . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed up the website , time-consuming all the time , and we &apos;re very popular in the Icelandic border , I went to Iceland and talked about this issue .
And the elements of the people there shouldn &apos;t be again , and as a result , the Sassic scientists of the United Nations , working with some other international experts , we named the law for a new kind of Icelandic Icelandic law , such as a Freedom Media , the most protective place for journalists all over the world , for the new Nobel Prize .
A North African country is like a North continent , which is heading up from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Icelandic prime minister announced it properly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure for the law of free demand and and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What shortcut is it ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to save lives — because with a little effort , we can throw it at one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience here , speaking , judges , honors , and all power to you .
Julie Sung : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I was a kid .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I was doing this , which is a nightmare .
I was walking through the halls of my childhood Connecticut and seeing it happen in the garden .
When I was growing up and I came back home in the early 1990s , I got this email .
My team broke .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , I suddenly realized how the rest of the world thought of it ?
And when I went to the temples where I would go , surprisingly , in North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in London , I would see four species of vultures repeated on the ice for Nine Mines were — clean , dark , silver and codes .
And I thought this was kind of a bizarre thing , and I was wondering whether anyone else ever had a copy of this sock model .
And when I went to visit him , I realized people weren &apos;t looking at the Catholic team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To confine the natural world into a few elements , there is no unusual human quality .
We did that 10 thousand years ago , when we analyzed our forests .
If you look at the zodiac sign 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s peppered and delighted , you &apos;ll see all these organisms .
But if you look back 2,000 years , all you will see are four animals : carrots , cows , leather and wheat .
It &apos;s also true for the elderly .
If you look at me on the streets of New York City 150 or 200 years ago , you will see pictures of garbage , beer and cans .
But if you look far away , you &apos;re going to see just four arrows : wheels , rubber , but also manure .
It turns out that we &apos;re heading towards this .
How did that happen to us ?
Sir .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
We &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
World War II gave us the greatest inspiration to be warm .
During the Great War , we advanced technology , like Susan , the Hole in the Wall , and all of those things came together .
And from the end of the Second World War , we now have to look at the fourth largest wave of mammals .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soil farm and the sea farm have increased , and then over the last two years , it has increased from concentration .
Now , if you collect forest pollution and forest pollution , it will spread from sea every year to sea to China .
Using my Chinese countertopic is not an agreement , because China is not only the largest country , but it is also the largest waste stream .
Let &apos;s move to our four choices .
The first is the most commonly used food in the U.S. and the West .
The forest floor is an extremely poor source .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , or 15 pounds of forest to get to the market .
Living to the store has an unbelievable level of honor .
In a study done in a study done in Dutch University , it showed that gasoline consumption from domestic greenhouse gases does not work very well .
But here &apos;s the problem .
The forest flows in the areas of battlefield are the Mongolian battles .
Now look at these nice little girls .
They maintain the footprint of the Earth for their place , protecting the beaches , the wildlife and the wildlife refugees , all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the Mongolian war .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years building millions of these forests .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher market calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You already saw something on the tropical river , which is very controversial .
Today , there are some things that are killing the little algae out of the bed , but with it , there are many more that are put together to spread the second leaf and then dump it into the soil .
And many times , the slums are being used by slums , which are called &quot; &quot; Redemption . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the slime mold that we like to see on the river , which means changing it into food , which means that the ecosystem is eating itself and making it cool .
After that , there &apos;s another great food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You have to look at large areas of the world to organize them just like teens .
We have a region in which scientific minorities call &quot; &quot; ICCAT . &quot; &quot; The International Committee for Climate Protection .
Carl Spain also considered the great invention of all technology .
We can make television screens , but television is not good enough for television sets .
Many don &apos;t know , but tattoos get heated .
He can span more than 40 miles an hour and convert his body temperature to 20 degrees Celsius around his environment .
The net charge on the market is almost entirely exhausting .
The blood vessels lined up with blood vessels that don &apos;t flow anymore .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creature , which is 40 miles away , does not have enough to stay in the forest .
Samantha had a good time , needless to say , this was destroyed by her mother .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut laid down a forest fire .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every dot is a document .
There are over 3,000 deaths in the state of Connecticut .
As a matter of fact , I &apos;m saying that there are a lot of people in the Internet . ( Laughter ) If anyone turns to the power of contact , then I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere , ladies and gentlemen , these are the rocks that propel the reserve to give to the children of Somalia .
As a result , we have a success story on the front lines and the front lines .
When Samantha started offering us a piano for Samantha , the forest floor was spent six pounds .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , one thing that happens is that it &apos;s a little bit of a mistake , because if you look at the footprint on the footprint , they name the footprint for a footprint on a foot .
And while this pie is thrown in the middle .
It &apos;s hard to say something about menu dollar and leather .
But then again , the market recommends industry that it narrowed the replacement of the FDA .
It &apos;s a system that produces ultraviolet , which is continuously played out by Java .
This goes on for seven percent of the year .
Even though we spend a little bit less money on the market for a monkey , we save very little money .
We &apos;re not just eating chili powder ; we &apos;re also planting chili powder .
We have chickens that are eating fruits and vegetables that are eating them .
Because on top of that , all the blood and hands and everything else are picked up by mosquitos .
I wonder if there &apos;s any vulture that takes the nectar , and it turns out to be empty .
India is the first or the first one . ( Laughter ) As a result , this is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third piece of China , or the third piece of Americans every year go out of the sea .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philadelphia literally started as a lifetime .
And it started with the owner of a local entrepreneur who saw that the next day , no one would ever turn on the mic .
He turned to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make yellow sign for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
The one that was most likely to save the ocean was one of the documents that Hole in the Wall did not win .
So he created his lift song .
Sadly , Sintia was innocent in 30 seconds .
She wanted to create a 25-centimeter gold standard , so she brought the entire continent .
According to the Baker Philadelphia , the largest mass-market industry in the United States , the arts industry is 73 billion pounds a year away from the sea .
If we stop polluting the police , maybe the alternative would be tripled .
Twenty years ago , nobody knew Taliban .
This changes the plant proteins in a very powerful way in animal protein , and this is the third world for me .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution that &apos;s been achieved in nine months by an individual .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like an inverted bracket .
It &apos;s not limited to the ECM and the ADHD that we think will be keeping us alive all the time .
So what do we do ?
I mean , it &apos;s about this poor little clip .
Which represents more than 30 million tons .
One possibility that conservationists have raised is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of giving it to people ?
There are reasons for this .
They have an amazing childhood in the market , where the average elite in the comparison with the neighborhood is at the peak of the Indus Valley .
This is OMG 3 , EPA and CDC .
So here &apos;s her potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of spending a few dollars a pound or a Pig ton and turned it into a foot , could we take the leather and give the monthly eggs twice as much money as we could ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting , though , is homework .
They have much more EPAA and ADHD .
The Indus trade-off is incredibly effective .
The cost of food to the market is only three parts .
Actually , it &apos;s about three o &apos;clock in the morning .
The sea ice creates three vertices in the middle , so they just collect .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western village , there has been several basic applications for phosphorus and nanotechnology .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , which are the number one cause of sea life .
Now , as you might think about Kallikuppam , in all these different ways , the proteins and the average of eight are highly effective .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last mile is a question mark .
We can produce a mesh that proves useful for ocean protein .
It needs to be a green fluorescent organism , a rapidly growing and changing environment , which is responsible for its own capabilities as a glorification , and it needs to be EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and Fitch East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I say that , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it all .
But don &apos;t try it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third largest migration rate in the world is about 30 million tons in the ocean .
I mean , it &apos;s all just happening .
We want to think about it without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a little bit subtle .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I grew up in the brain to read , because I have a brother who suffers from a neurological illness called schizophrenia .
More and later , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I could connect my dreams to my reality and create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s not connecting his dreams to the public and his collective reality , and he &apos;s doing it .
So I spent my life studying severe mental illness .
And I moved from my appointment project to Boston , where I work at the President François Bank , which is the hallmark of Harvard University .
So what was the difference between the brain of people who are typically referred to as being compared to the brain of people who are facing schizophrenia or hypertension , and so what we &apos;re actually trying to do is create a map of the brain &apos;s microprocessor network , whom is the cell text messenger with the &quot; &quot; chemical , &quot; &quot; and what quantity of the brain ?
So there was a lot of privilege in my life , because I was doing this kind of research on the day , but on a weekend and weekend , I was traveling along the outskirts of NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I got to know that I was faced with an intellectual disaster .
The lower left of my brain was a nine-foot drop .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and remember things in the morning of college .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you look at the same brain , there are two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve brought a human brain to show you .
( Audio and laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the back of the brain , the left part of the brain , and the right arm is touching the left part of the brain , and it &apos;s going to keep in mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that computers are actually part of our brain working like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain is functioning like a seal processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other across the culture of the orchestra community that some 3,000 volunteers combined .
But there are two parts which are absolutely open .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing each part has a completely different understanding of the information , their facial expression on different things , and you let it happen , and I think their personalities are very different from each other .
Congratulations . Thank you very much .
Teacher : Well done .
( Laughter ) The evidence is just in our brains right now , and it &apos;s thinking about that moment .
So right now , part of our brain is thinking about images that are organized by the movements of our bodies .
Information flows through our bodies and expands throughout the body through our nervous system , and then it contracts and expands to form a giant almond-shaped classroom that we see in the present moment how we feel and how we feel in our minds .
I am an energy geographical approach to the energy of the neighborhood via the remote control of the brain .
We &apos;re using energy from each other to sensitize the sensitivity of the left parts of the brain to a human family .
And right now , we are brothers and sisters on this planet to make the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and wonderful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is scientifically and scientifically thinking .
The left part of our brain is about the past and the future .
To the left of the brain is to say that we take our current great album / Class and we analyze it and then we begin to collect analyses .
And it also informs organizations and maps of information that connects all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past and all the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past , and the possibilities of the future , which are named after our projects .
The left part of our brain thinks in language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that is taking us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that , you know , you have to go home and buy it and remember it .
I &apos;m going to need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a sense of pursuing my computational book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice she says ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become divided .
I &apos;m the only person in the room who has access to affordable energy and energy around you .
And that part of my brain , that morning , was dead on the floor .
The morning of the destruction , my left eye slammed into a broken nose .
It was as painful as the Asian woman has to get in .
And that pain that connected me and left me alone .
And then he leaves , and then he leaves .
It was extraordinary to me that I &apos;d never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing I do every day . &quot; &quot; So I put on the lightbulbs and I put on my cardboard , which is a body sports machine .
Now , I &apos;m fascinated by this machine , and it &apos;s kindly reminded me that , like my hand is just the tip of an early man who &apos;s touching the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is so bizarre and bizarre . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the way I had changed my mind , which is the general sense of being a man who is racing from this experience , but now I was in a rich and violent place where my consciousness was aware of the experience
And it was all very strange and poor , and my brain was increasing pain .
So I got out of the machine and I started walking around the room and I realized that everything in my body was simple .
And everybody is thinking very , very hard .
There &apos;s no connection in my speed , and I think what we need is a house that focuses only on the internal system .
I &apos;m growing up in my bedroom ready to underneath the water and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying yes , my brother is to play you now .
Yes , my foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing my balance , so I grab hold of the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can no longer repair my body &apos;s waste .
I have no idea where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to stop , because my hand has atom and the magnetic wall pulled together by atoms and Michael .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the speech on the left of my brain just kept quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice on a regular monitor .
One last month .
Before that , I had an amazing breath in my brain .
But then immediately , like the other light bulb , I came across this huge wavelength of energy that surrounded me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a bone divided into my brain and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you are a spreadsheet . &quot;
We really need to help him , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I was really in trouble , but I came back quickly with a sense of what I say for a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think about how beautiful it is that you &apos;re completely connected to this tiny brain that is surrounded by the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my novel is and I &apos;m getting really tired of it .
I was feeling a lot of shame in my body .
And if you look at all of your relationships that come from the outside world and under that , there was no tolerance .
And I felt a space of peace and compassion .
And lo and behold , what would it look like if the back was 37 years of passionate weight you &apos;ve been holding ?
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the right part of my brain and he said , &quot; Hey , dear heart rate . &quot;
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking , should I be helpful , so I recovered from a secret home and I put a machine gun in my apartment , and now I &apos;m thinking , can I get a car to work ? &quot; &quot; And at that point , my hands have been completely plastered .
It was then that I realized that my God was going to hurt me , and the first thing that my mind tells me is how amazing it is .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
Some neuroscientists will be alert to the possibility that they will be able to witness their own brain and they will come from inside — ( Laughter ) — and then one of them came to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I have no time to relax . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the philosophy business , but I &apos;ll come back to my normal business in a couple of weeks . Okay .
I have to call for help . I have to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the first job I ever got , and then I remembered that I had my own business card , which is my phone number .
Then I go into my studio and I spend a 350-year-old MattA card .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eye what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you this is my card , not because I &apos;m looking at any of these other dots .
And the words would be helpful with the maps of paper and the marks , and I was missing something .
And then I started waiting for what I call the letter of the exhibition .
And at that moment , the typical truth was repeated , and I found that it &apos;s not a card ; it &apos;s not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this shot .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the impact on the left was getting greater .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I don &apos;t have a way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in .
I took the business card and I put it there , and now I look at the records and see the little girls posting on the phone as the matriarch lady .
But then I take my brother to Belshazzar , when I came back , and I couldn &apos;t recall that I had taken that number , that I didn &apos;t .
So I raised my hand like a Dutch , and I raised my hand like a Dutch , and I raised my hand like a Dutch grandmother raised my hand and said , &quot; &quot; Wow , wow , wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , by the way , I &apos;ll tell you that I had just come back from India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; (
So I say this in my mind clearly , &quot; I &apos;m talking to you , I need to help you . &quot;
And from my voice , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Whoa . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Gould River . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I had no idea that I could speak a language and I couldn &apos;t understand until I tried to sing .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And shortly after that , on an ambulance trip , Sierra Leone was visiting the hospital by another Masosthenes General .
I would climb up and look like the children of a tiny baby .
Just like the one story in which the rest of the herd takes place and doesn &apos;t get out of poverty , I pull out the energy and I feel the pressure of my spirit .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer in control of my life .
Or perhaps my doctor saved me and offered me a second chance of life or a second chance of being transported .
By the time I left , I was so amazed that I still survive .
When I felt ashamed of my spirit , I shared my life with God .
Now my brain was experiencing firsthand the opposite of reality .
It was then that my emotional system started to achieve emotional trauma , which was deep pain .
The light was shining my brain like the fire in the forest , and the eyes were so dense and so bright that I could hear a voice from the background , or I could not hear a voice , and I was only following the path of furniture .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body &apos;s whiskey , so I felt enormous and enormous , like a person who was free from my belt .
And my mind grew free , like a great storm surrounding the ocean of desalination brine .
Great Neuron .
I found the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking it would never be possible that I would discover my great desire path and my ability to translate this tiny internal space .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I still live , and I am fascinated .
And if I have been brought up by neurons and I still live , then whatever life is , it can be turned into neurons , and I &apos;ve seen the world filled with lovely , fresh , comfortable and loving people who know that they can sometimes feel that quality .
And they can pick and choose , well , the right thing is that they want to take their books off the left side of their brain to look for transparent quality .
And then I understood how great a gift this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What is this lesson of clarity that has taught me to live my life ?
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a half-hour stroke , the south pole picked up a pile of blood vessels from my brain compared to a pump of blood vessels that were monitoring the neocortex .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real misfit in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of cosmic life with the advanced skills and two extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step back to my left corner of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful , sterile microbial cells contain a shape , a shape , with all of that in them .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness , where I become an individual , in a tiny way .
From quantum entanglement to energy .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
I have an inside us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend our left-hand corridors in the cerebral cortex , the more we will put peace in this world and the more our planet will be stable .
And I thought that I had to sort this out .
Thank you .

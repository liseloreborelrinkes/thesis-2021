It became good !
Are you people around ?
They took my name to TED , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on TED ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , as a young boy , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and I was forced to eat .
So I asked the question , would you like to play in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , and he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minority , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French correct word ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , deal with it ! &quot; &quot; Blah blah .
She was talking to me , as she was telling her , &quot; If this girl is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy took two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can he speak that way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got tired of it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s wrong with me talking about my country ?
Where could that be ?
How did we get here ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there are many people like me , who have reached a stage in their life where , ironically , they drop everything that &apos;s going on in their topic , just because they can say that they &apos;re loving and sweating .
Should I be raising my whole culture , my imagination , my mind and my spirit ?
We may have the most important battle savings in children &apos;s stories .
Should they give me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
What makes sense ?
In spite of all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for the president like what it was for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research , the language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we communicate when we work on a curriculum scheme , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use for David .
If we do that , they will outperform us .
So where can I interpret this ? We can all ask this question .
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But another more important fact that we should think about .
Arabic has a language .
Research says that in other languages , you have to pass your mother tongue .
In other languages , it &apos;s the primary state of the native language for creativity .
How ?
Gabriel Gabriel Gabriel , when he first started writing , he invited Arabic .
All of their imaginations , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in the villages where she grew up , felt a special joy , felt a special voice , and thought about a special idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they write in English , when you learn their English literature , you feel the same joy , you feel the same sense .
So you can imagine that even in English these are the same teachers , the little boys who lived in these villages , who lived in a town on the outskirts of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill one , the only way to kill one is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are emerging .
Germany , France , Japan and China all stand up .
That &apos;s why they create laws for protecting their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the portfolio , they spend a lot of capital on the long-term money-law .
Do we know better ?
Well , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to get to this growing world .
They were the countries that were like us at a time , but decided to try to grow up , to research , to go to countries like Tamil , to meet meetings , to take their language with themselves as though they were growing older .
They made it their own .
Because if you take tissues or you take tissues and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe that this is local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these conflicts , not standing up , as we are most of the time .
So in order to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to save their language .
If I said , &quot; &quot; Freedom , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , what , what and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a sign of the special stages in our lives , and the phrases that get rid of our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will make a special gesture in your brain . There are special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not a noun or two or three .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our brain ?
How are you going to understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the Freedom of English ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t look at a problem , I &apos;d better leave and don &apos;t spend time talking about injustice .
The point is that these influences remind us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker whose fate is from France .
Once upon a time , he was asked .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s fine , but once , I tried to elaborate and translate it one night to try and figure out what it means to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thousands of women got it wrong , and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He was thinking , how can such a state of mind be ?
Do they want to be self-sufficient ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of many examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand what his wife meant , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right beside himself ; his thoughts are different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he calls with me the freedom , and one evening , I tried to translate for him to feel what I felt when I heard the decision . &quot; &quot; The next woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve raised her hand and you &apos;ve got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I said , &quot; &quot; Because you &apos;re me , I &apos;ve put my hands on and you &apos;ve put
He translated . He showed me .
( Applause ) So what did we do for the Arab Spring ?
We transformed it into a narrative for the society , and we started the conversation in Arabic .
As many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Get ready , get ready . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The curator of the Arabic dictionary translated a line , which is , &quot; I speak to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because , like , we didn &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody tells me , I &apos;m not from Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be responsible in the way that our desires , our desires and our daily lives reflect .
It &apos;s the same as ours and the same as ours .
So this says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the East , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; And then you sit back .
Too easy , but powerful .
After that , we started another exercise with the landscape of the Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , a perspective in which the letter black and blue is at home , with the text that says , &quot; Make language kill . &quot;
Why ? Don &apos;t actually kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to put a sign on ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And these scores are so much more than playing modernity and modernity .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls before the Arab Spring .
Khalil &apos;s photographs of boys and girls .
We are so cold !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; college &quot; &quot; in there . &quot; &quot; They want to say two , but I have to say a word that &apos;s great and that &apos;s true .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not music ! We shouldn &apos;t change yours .
But to get to that point , we need to tell everyone that we &apos;re not going to let anyone become bigger or that we &apos;re going to have a choice in our language , to press us , to press us , to attack us and to think about ourselves .
Our vision is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach a cell or not reach a rocket or something , we can still be creative .
At this point , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way of creating a native language .
Let &apos;s start with this time .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global level .
He can re-branch Arabic-speaking again .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know that , and we have to say that the solution exists , that the solution is to be part of the solution .
In the end , what can you do today ?
Which of you are Twittering ?
No Muslims , I bet you , though , my time is up , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the numbers , don &apos;t write English with words !
( Applause ) That &apos;s it ! It &apos;s no language .
You enter a virtual world with a mathematical language .
Getting back and forth is not easy .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot of other things .
We &apos;re not here to talk to each other today .
We &apos;re here to demonstrate the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , spouses his father &apos;s language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , that &apos;s it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I promised my daughter to light that in the marketplace , if she said to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you Arabic . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going
And it &apos;s not going to be predictable that no one &apos;s going to get old . ( Applause ) You get a small drop out of this cultural shopping mall . ( Applause )
I speak to you in ancient English , to tell us that it &apos;s a deep mystery to remind us that our situation is not the same as the one in which my people are falling apart , even when you haven &apos;t seen my generation , we haven &apos;t seen my generation banks before us , and I &apos;ve been terrified of this generation of inequality that &apos;s not good for our generation until they &apos;re known for gi@@
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In school , my primary attorney was Gornett , which meant I had to write a lot of documents .
Now a normal person , when they write something , will do something about it .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to start work very quickly , but in the first week , you do a lot of work and after a lot of work , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I also want to do that .
That &apos;s my approach .
My answer would be all sorts of things , but the actual work of instruction would start on the surface , and then I would do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all the educational jobs .
And then came up with a whole new paper on the front page , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my common collaborator was not funny for the subject matter .
It was a huge job .
I set up the plan , and I decided to do something like this .
This year it &apos;s going to go something like this .
I &apos;m going to start small , middle class , work is going to go up , and eventually I &apos;m going to zoom in on it more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few weeks ago ?
Come on , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we created a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went home one day and it was three days in the David Laun , and I didn &apos;t write a word until then , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I made 90 pages , two streets , and I did — humans shouldn &apos;t go on two streets — the first one took place in Camarasas well , spent time on free speed , and all done .
I thought , now it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk about your issue . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;m going to look at you today , that &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was a big deal . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be really nice to this moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; &quot; This is amazing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write a blog , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about it .
My Rwanda gives me six people a day and I want to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the human brain and why we are .
Now my premise was that the brains of simple people differ from six people .
Understanding this , I made a leaf blood vessel where I could harvest both of these brains with a severe head and a severe head , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look away and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , this is not so obvious , but consider this .
So this is a six-man brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of these brains have a decent decision , but the rest of the brain is played out in fun .
Now what does this mean in a simple way ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s not done .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work is the best time to complete . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; Mind people will decide to make meaningful decisions in order to make meaningful decisions , but the source doesn &apos;t like this scheme , so he &apos;s picking up the book , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please read the page for the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Never forget about the standard of Tonight Har@@
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;ll go to the pub , and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After this , you &apos;ll see on YouTube what &apos;s going to start talking about the rhythm of Richard &apos;s art , and many days later it &apos;s going to end up watching protests on Twitter .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while for all of these things , so it &apos;s not going to take time to do something else today .
What &apos;s going to be the sympathy ? ( SS ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the origin of consciousness that you want to believe .
It just wants to be in the present .
It has no perspective for the future , but it has only two things : human beings and compassion .
In the animal world , it &apos;s all fine .
If you know how many of you and you spend your whole life going forward , you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And to conclude , there is a generation of human animals .
Good food , good thought , and increased generation , tribes get this way .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , the bill isn &apos;t too far .
We are a growing class , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting out of date .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And it &apos;s only us who want to be happy to do that .
Sometimes it &apos;s true that they do what &apos;s easier and easier to eat , sleep or chance .
So there &apos;s a collision .
Sometimes they agree .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is climate change .
And for the simple people , this tension always reveals the end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet corner , a simple and sustainable way that religions are outside of the circle .
I call this a perfect place .
( Laughter ) The dark matter is the place where the elite people are standing right .
This is where dignity takes place when it doesn &apos;t have to be romantic .
In the dark matter that most of you are aware of , in fact , is not a joke , because it &apos;s not a joke , it &apos;s a crime , it &apos;s a fear , it &apos;s a danger , it &apos;s a self-sufficient feeling , it &apos;s all the properties that are in the right order .
The question is , in this case , when the building blocks , how does a human being stand inside the blue , which is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that regular people are also conservative , that every time they protect in their logical spaces — somebody tells him to cheat .
( Laughter ) Now this is a house which is more popular , but when David Lawn gets close , it becomes a wave , or then when people are at risk of embarrassing , occupying or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that creation is only happening .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was to come to TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and my anger , something else was happening in the brain of the decision-maker .
&quot; &quot; Have you ever understood anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the Indian peak at the bottom 200 feet of India and see the Indian peak at the bottom 200 feet when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , another month later , people at TED decided to sign the names of the candidates .
I picked up the web and it was my picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house itself was flat , and within seconds the system was flat . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the house , he wandered around the tree .
And finally , and finally , the religious decision maker picked up the money and could start talking .
Now the homework assignment that every district emphasizes , someone like me would spend two weeks trying to get the article started , and then suddenly , unbelievably , the unbelievable advice of work takes place all night long and writing articles .
And the three-pound pregnancy is what we call the system of simple people .
It &apos;s not very good for anyone .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about this .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the impact on this .
In fact , I get thousands of emails from all over the world and from people who were responsible for all sorts of things .
They included narcissists , bankers , engineers , penetrators and poor PCDs .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody said the same thing and said , &quot; I am the same as this . &quot;
What was surprising to me was that the Emily County Association and the Emily County .
There was a myth in the history of these people that wrote how hard she has expressed in her life , in terms of what she did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , then what happens ?
Why are all these people in America ?
It turns out there are two sections on the surface .
Today , for example , the subject matter that I gave was all David Laun .
And when David is blind , recently , the effects of his recent cold are underground because he reaches home .
But sitting still is part two , and it &apos;s not dependent on any David Laun .
So if you want a project that starts itself like some arts or businesses — like some arts or businesses , until you don &apos;t start paying attention to the speed , to do things .
In addition to tasks , there are many other things that David Lawn doesn &apos;t have , like being with his family , exercising , understanding your health , understanding your relationships , telling your relationships that you &apos;re not going to be good at .
Now , if the only way to work is to work in a basketball field , it &apos;s difficult , because all of these data points require that the house is missing .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with you .
And this is the long-term materials that come from very little to look at and talk less about than steel materials , purely based materials .
You &apos;re getting a lot of shame and shame .
And it can be a metaphor for long-term stewardship and readiness .
So I thought that was why they were emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in bad shape .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
Traffic furniture has been observed , sometimes in their own lives .
The disorder is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cope with it .
I read all the emails , and one thing came out — I think six people didn &apos;t exist .
I think you &apos;re all easy .
Yes , it may not be that complicated . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of us have good relationships with David Laun , but remember when David Laun doesn &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Candler of Life .
Every blank means one week , it &apos;s new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been recovered .
I think we all need to have a career address .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the businesses , because in every single life there is no time .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have the same household on there , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days in the United States and Afghanistan , a dozen Afghan Afghan provinces were staying home from a region of Afghanistan , staying home from a region of Afghanistan , helping to provide a support for the Afghan government to provide a service to the security services to the Afghan security services , to help a security department of the Afghan government provide an access to a
She came to the threshold of a campaign , and she was home from three corners , and with a lot of stuff , she watched Captain Susson as a child , and she watched Captain Susson as a child be born in the afternoon , so she could save lives and save lives .
One of the other surgeons who knew about her kids , and she and she grew up with a hero who was a medical adviser , and she and she grew up with a hero who was a Spanish doctor .
It turns out that the capacity for Kevin Switzerland and his reason for this climate change is overheated .
They downloaded it to the helicopter and then you see what the captain can do , and they put it on top of it before they can save others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
Here &apos;s a loving one , and I knew why I work with people who don &apos;t .
You know , you &apos;re welcomed into the crowd by people who are wanting to approach themselves so that others can benefit .
In business , we put bonds to people who are willing to judge others so that we can benefit .
There we go .
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these are just the best people .
That &apos;s why they land on the brink .
These are the best people on the brink of employment ; they &apos;re the best people on the brink of employment .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is an environment , and if you have the right environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , then each one of us has the ability to engage and work together , and increase it , and also have the ability to do that in others .
I have the privilege of bringing some of these people together and saying , &quot; &quot; We will have the privilege of meeting with these people . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We will have the privilege of bringing ourselves to the danger of saving others and asking them , &quot; &quot; Why can you do this ?
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said , &quot; Well , because they do . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important here .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they are emotions , not actions .
You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Stop me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I put two people together and they do it .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does this attraction come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago at the peak of the Homo sapiens coming , what we see is that the world has to be fueled by dangers , all of these forces are deeply focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Women can be decreased by the lack of resources , but it &apos;s been working together to reduce the longevity of our lives , all together , to reduce the longevity of our lives .
And so we flew in social animals where we &apos;re all together and work together to create a kind of justice , like in a situation where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt preserved in ourselves , cooperation was intimate .
It has autonomous benefits .
That means I can go up to the night and walk around and see some of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t trust each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t trust you , it means you &apos;re not going to be risky .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are trying to make our lives difficult or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
They can scale up the markets . They can be uncertain .
It can be a new technology that will take your business class and drop it at night , and it can be a new technology that will take your business class and step out at night .
Or you can fight that sometimes you try to fight .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it stops your growth and it &apos;s trying to drive your businesses to steal your growth and your businesses to drive you .
We have no choice of those powers .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it will never be done .
The only driver of change is conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where the value comes from , because that &apos;s the leadership that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the savings and lives of the people in the organization that are preserving and saving the lives of the people in the organization , and that is to justify their dignity and goodness results so that people can be present , and that is to justify their dignity and intensity results so that people can feel protected and feel protected and feel their own personal connection
I was on a holiday trip , and I realized the fact that when a traveler tried to walk in , before he could find it , and I saw the stakeholders at the door just like he passed the law like he did .
The first time I tried to walk on it , it was the first time I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you make us wear machines ?
Why can &apos;t you do the same thing with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we like to travel to the West Bank is not because they rank the LGBT people .
That &apos;s why they don &apos;t drive from their leaders .
You see , if conditions are preserved , we spend our time and strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and strength keeping you from one another and it reduces organization .
What a great leader does is I can show you the nearest example of how a parent can become a good leader for her , the nearest example of being a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what would you like ? What does it make ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , systems and regulation , when necessary , we want to give our children opportunities , education , systems and just , when necessary , we want to give them more and more of what we can do for themselves , so that they can grow and have more of what we can do for ourselves .
Good leaders want that .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , systems and precision , when they need it , they want to give their people opportunities , education , systems and precision , when they need it , they want to create self-confidence , they want to give them opportunities to stay engaged and fail so that they can achieve the greater advances that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve the greater advances that we
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , and he says , if your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever save your child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie has given rise to the security of employment , and Charlie has given rise to the security of employment .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you &apos;re not engaged in effective problems .
But if you have a problem , they &apos;ll introduce you and they &apos;ll help you , just like we &apos;ll do for a kid who &apos;s coming home from school to collect C &apos;s .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s the reason that people in the audience have so much ingenuity and ingenuity , some of the bankers from the CEO , the reason that hundreds of people have so much ingenuity and ingenuity , some of the banks have come from the CEO , which is why hundreds of people have so much ingenuity and ingenuity , some of the banks have come from the CEO , who have so much ingenuity
It &apos;s not about data .
They &apos;ve mastered the fundamental principles of power .
They have grown a dense society .
We know that they have given risks to their grandchildren , and we know that they have given risks to their grandchildren , rather than that they have given risks to their grandchildren , rather than that they have given their grandchildren the risk of their grandchildren , rather than that they have convinced their grandchildren to their own children .
This is what gives us no data .
Could anyone get the land to save the Gando 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
Good leaders will never release the data to save people .
Good leaders will never release the data to save people .
Instead , they &apos;ll give people the skin data to save , but they &apos;ll give people the skin data to save .
Bob Chip , in the middle of the Media Development Corporation , leaves a miniaturization company called Barry-Wehmiller in 2008 , which has become a major trademark , and they have 30 percent of their traffic at night .
Now in a big mining company , this is a big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy more goods .
They needed 10 million dollars , and so many of the companies that have now joined the board and did the right thing .
And Bob answered that .
You see , Bob &apos;s gender is not confident .
Instead , Bob believes in blood flow , and reducing heart valves is much harder and harder to reduce heart attacks .
And then they built a dedicated program .
That every job , every teacher , every single one of us had to get to the CEO in the small four-week vacation .
They could never do it when they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But as Bob declared the program , it becomes very important .
He said that it &apos;s better to take all of us seriously seriously , because some of us take much more risks and get paid like this .
They have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you can expect , when people feel empowered by an organization , trust and cooperation is intimate .
And just like nobody had expected , people started trading from each other .
What was more successful was they traded with less successful people .
Something like five letters of someone else has to license another three letters .
Calculus is an election , not an option .
I know a lot of people who are at the top of the organizations , and I know a lot of people who are at the top of the organizations who are not the leaders at all .
They &apos;re lovely warriors and we do what they say because they have choice but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in the middle of organizations who have no choice , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have a generosity to look at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have a generosity to look at the person on the left , and they have a generosity to look at the person on the right , and they have a generosity to look at the person on the right .
This is a lead .
I heard a story about some of the science that was going on out in the theater and just like the philosophers are going to eat right now and they &apos;re going to play before they go away and save something for it .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his playground so he could eat because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
We tell them that they start .
We call them leaders because they are receiving dangerous money from one another , and we call them leaders because they are receiving dangerous money from one another .
We call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can be preserved , we call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can be preserved , we call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can be preserved and so that people can be preserved , and when we do that , it is possible that our people will be compassionate .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and blood and blood and so they &apos;ll see that their leaders &apos; dream is becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your blood and your blood to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because that &apos;s what they do for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all like to do ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all love to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all love to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in a small story about the Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is so unbelievable , such as season , and growing up in these conditions is so difficult to grow up once in 17 years , I was staying in a room with friends in the museum floor .
The sun is getting warmer in the season .
And as I was dozing off in the street , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you just invent stuff that &apos;s on your skin and don &apos;t you have to wash ? &quot; &quot; I was sitting there , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m buying this stuff , &quot; &quot; and I got home , and I did some research and I got some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-five of them are in Africa , and 50 are only in South Africa .
Different diseases fall into the environment that is the most dangerous tragedy of all .
The reason the Trachoma is a reflex is because of one of the more complicated emissions of the trachoma , you can be independently inspired .
This disease affects eight million individuals every year , and the most interesting thing about it is that to save a tragedy , you only have to give up your mother : no grandmother , no kidneys , no English .
After seeing these thoughtful data and seeing the data , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and not just wanting to mess up , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then my brother gave me his 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a
And to watch this was like a private issue of caffeine .
So Jesus is right , our pheromone is getting faster .
Now we need to work on this .
Four years later , after I wrote my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent in the country and — &quot; &quot; No more gold ! &quot; &quot; — I can &apos;t say more than that . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first exchange pollution .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need butter .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and fine-tuning tools , which I had , the Middle East came in with some new people , did more of it , and now we have a full-blown paradox , which is ready for the market , but now is ready for the market .
We &apos;ve learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They just buy the property . One person doesn &apos;t buy a ticket at Alex . They buy a ticket , because it takes a lot more money .
So we found DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just pull it between the two and leave it outside .
And the cool thing is , one tenth of a meal is only in five rations .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about the efficiency of manufacturing .
We even want DriBath &apos;s promiscuous child to be here . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever they leave the waste , and we could save two houses for children , which are in dense areas , two houses , more than two houses for the school system , two houses for more than two houses for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it with our key values , health and safety .
DryBath is a poor man &apos;s voice and a protector &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually in the process of setting this up , now we &apos;re in the process of setting up a multinational brand that can be sold into the retail market , and one question I have for my collaborators today , on the Limpopo Railway , with a 50-dollar bill that doesn &apos;t have to cover the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And another important thing is that I learned a lot about this early operation , and last year Google has introduced me to the world &apos;s greatest youth .
I am also the world &apos;s greatest teacher of science entrepreneurs , the first African who received this account , and one thing that amazes me so much , is why all these teachers didn &apos;t want to cheat . Thank you .
( Applause )
Luckily , I &apos;m presenting some of these results to you today , and I &apos;m also surprised to myself what are the actual successes of governments — which are actually causing the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick up a group of people with the desire for equal goods and organize them at the beginning , you &apos;re going to have human capabilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them impossible .
But , if initial governments are really the best , why is it that often failure ?
So I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to think about this as a lot of organizations , reflecting a lot of my wrongful ideas and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations in the past to me .
I wanted to know this because I started a variety of businesses at the age of 12 , where I went from being a high school kid to being a low-performing school kid to being a solar engine , to school , when I made a radio spoofer .
Back in school , I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we started to build more than 100 companies , many , many , many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to look at these factors for the greatest cause of management success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I coined my company , &quot; &quot; Idea Lip &quot; &quot; — the old-fashioned version that you feel about someone .
With climbers , I thought maybe the team , the ability to perceive kidney or vice , are more important factors .
I &apos;d never thought there &apos;d be a mechanical TV speaker here at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everybody &apos;s got a plan , until I don &apos;t have a mom . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team has the ability to navigate from the side of the car to the next level .
Coach is an objective reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
Then I started looking at business models .
Is management a clear operation on aid ?
With this idea , it seemed to me that what is the most important thing for success .
So think about new investment .
Sometimes companies make a big investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
After this — is it true ?
Did it come out very quickly , and it wasn &apos;t good for the world ?
This is soon , so you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or is there a lot of damage , and already there &apos;s a lot of damage ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of precision for these five factors in many organizations .
And the idea was to go to 100 companies in Libya , and 100 of them could go out and find a scientific result .
So first of these ideas , first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoZero , Tickets.com. — these are all dollars &apos; worth of business .
And at the bottom five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we had a lot of hope , but no success .
And then I tried to cultivate all of these qualities , as I thought they were , and these companies were coming in .
And then in the businesses outside Ideas , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb , Instagram , Uber , YouTube , LinkedIn .
Here &apos;s some successes : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz , and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in NGOs , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to figure out , but the most important factor was the success and failure of all these companies , and the result struck me .
The first thing was choosing time .
Forty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other end of the spectrum , and then the idea , being different , being individual , is really the third multiplication .
But it &apos;s not really clear , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but it &apos;s surprising to me that the idea doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it becomes more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment comes in my mind .
I think business model doesn &apos;t work anymore because you can start without a business model , and then when you grow a village manufacturer , include it .
And investment , if initially it &apos;s less investment , but now it &apos;s growing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I &apos;d like to give you a few examples here of all of these notes .
Take the big success of Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of venture capitalists looked at this because people thought , &quot; &quot; Where is it going to be ?
Of course , it &apos;s all wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of the businesses is because of the best business model , the idea , and the best business lie .
This company came in front of the financial crisis when people needed additional support , and it made sure to help people respond to the proposition of putting a forest in their home .
That &apos;s Uber &apos;s business .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
However , the time was just right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional help ; it was very important .
Some successes , like Citysearch , come when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to have more support for businesses .
We thought it was a great idea , but in fact , it took a lot more time .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . With a lot of supplies and a better business model , talk to the giant Hollywood artists to work with .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband Internet was much lower .
The online video was so difficult to watch , you didn &apos;t know what to do in your browser , and eventually this company revealed its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with the Adobe Flash solved the problem of the code and the Broadband band in America grew more than 50 percent , YouTube arrived at the best time .
Incredible , perfect time .
The truth is , when YouTube started , there was no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But it was the best time .
So in short , perception is really important .
Ideas matter very much .
But maybe choosing time is really important .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if there &apos;s really a shortcut to your outcome .
And the truth of certainty is , the outcome is not from them , because if something you like , you want to keep it going , but in the process of time you have to work very safely .
As I said before , institutions can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
I hope some of them will contribute to increasing your success , and then making the world a little bit better .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best listeners .

&#91; 3 April 3 , 2016 we saw the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; Panama Papers debated peaceful and energy-efficient people &#93; &#91; Government spread in non-profit &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Robert Prize to the Gallup Walters Report . &#93; &#91; This week , the championship was central to the succession of Gaddafi &apos;s law
The military dictated these efforts as part of the dirty rubber company .
We find the inner stories of villages , banks and schools that come in with forms like Mozambique Fountain and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a dirty company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see Emily &apos;s , you can see the translation of messages , you can see the way you do business , how they work .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The leading candidates in the U.S.
We also have the news that there are drought-tolerant Doctors in the sleeping world .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of stolen revenue goes to my home plate through her childhood friend , the celebrity State .
And there will be a lot of blind people who will be infected , and even those who will , from then on , will be arrested for more blind statements .
Now this sounds like a magic movie or a John Jesus Christ &apos;s novel .
What should we do with it ?
But it &apos;s true that agronomists and energy people are sitting in their pockets and they &apos;re not supposed to be taxed , meaning that efficient actions such as health and education are less money .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization at Galapagos , this is amazing .
Worldwide media and political leadership are talking about how people can lower their performance in smartphones about what we &apos;re talking about .
I think for people , this is the world of chess , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these companies work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can go to another company , another company out of a company , and it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind the curtain .
It &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s going on for the regulators , the press , the solar system .
I think that &apos;s also interesting in the United States .
It &apos;s probably not because of the famous American exception .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in asking companies .
It &apos;s because of the fashion industry , there are a few American cities in Mexico .
I think if we &apos;re reading Kenema &apos;s inventions , or Dil Walter , or Mountain , or Mountain Home , or Mountain , or whatever , references to American relations .
Instead , many American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give less information to run a company than the Library of Cards .
In American schools , hidden information like this is given to students .
Non-zero-sumness capital allows entrepreneurship .
This region affects all of us .
Now in the Galapagos , we wanted to look at how this problem works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we converted a shop and flew over 13 low-lying companies in Manhattan .
Our education became an African minister who wanted to move to America to a home , a ship and a space to buy .
The heart note was that all the villages gave a premise of how to move a hunger .
These were all primary meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our own money , and we didn &apos;t pay anybody , but this was a systematic destruction .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about the individual law that talked about our hidden assumption and our identification .
It &apos;s not just a series of politicians that have been found in Scandal .
It &apos;s the way the system works , which resists touch , enhances fitness , weight and unemployment .
And for that to happen , we &apos;re going to change this game .
We &apos;re going to have to change the rules of the game in order to make it harder for the region .
It can be intuitive , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
So in the last few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This issue was addressed to the political council , but the British Prime Minister of Defense has spent eight centuries in the South Land in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is establishing a central record , a central record of which companies are actually in Europe or is controlling them .
The key thing is that the U.S. is behind it .
In terms of abstract law enforcement , it &apos;s different in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to grow , so we did .
They want to look at innovations , large-scale companies , that are being used across the world and in the U.S.
This change is in the Gulf Watts .
Over the years , we need to reach out to the people who are left behind by the Royal Society , the Bishop Leader .
Remember , they sound , it &apos;s not okay for a curiosity like this , we are .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to address this misinformation law change law .
We can cooperate flexibility in the ways that Texas has the result of cutting and opening courses .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julian .
It &apos;s said that the Lex , the inventor of you , has made much more sense in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Could it be true ?
Julian Asanga : Yes , can it be true ?
This is a legitimate thing . What &apos;s not ? — that media is showing worldwide total abundance that a small group of businesses are able to share information that is far more than the rest of the world &apos;s media .
CA : What &apos;s that going on ?
How do people form documents ?
And how do you balance them ?
Julian Asanga : Yes , there are — I can tell you — there will be public service in the right way , and we have lots of ways to get the information to us .
That &apos;s why we use a lot of court code to deliver materials from one place to the Internet , to deliver them to legal contracts like Sweden and Belgium .
We get the data from the cloud , from ordinary data , symbols or whatever , operating it like public news agencies , mistakes — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about mass information to public and then protecting yourself against legitimate and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you never really know what the scale is .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ll always find out where this is going , and if we get stuck in a hallway , we &apos;ll quickly release the information .
( Whistling ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s obvious what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , so it &apos;s a chocolate reporter .
It was a mysterious reporter that the government of Kenya qualified after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had been there for 18 years .
He was a Syrian refugee .
And when the book came out — according to the authoritarian authorities who were trying to decide that Kenya would spend 20 million pounds on this report card and so on .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for its own political benefits , which was the wealthiest people — now the wealthiest people in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why in 2007 , we were successful in getting this out of the right election , early December 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after that new report , Kabash decided to volunteer to the person who was horrified by the destruction of Daniel Armada , so that &apos;s how the report was held and sold at the door of the cake .
Chris Anderson : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s just that — this was spread in Kenya , not by a crazy idea , but by the way and with you , it changed the result of selection .
Julian Sanging : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafin , and then it &apos;s been popular throughout all of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he believed that , after a few years , Kenya &apos;s genius was able to talk about it .
And it sits on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it has changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the weight , as compared to a Chinese Internet company , and the result has changed before that .
CA : Wow , so how did your best idea actually change the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re showing a little video of a challenging audience .
This is a video that &apos;s broken . But here &apos;s a little video .
This — I &apos;ll tell you , this is a heart attack video .
RD : ... Good morning , when you first pick them up , two .
I thought , oh , there are four with them .
It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s okay now . Glass is running .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me . Come on .
They &apos;re all dollars .
Okay , Glass !
( Mechanical noises ) Glory running . Glory running . ( Mechanical noises ) Glory running .
HP : Big Master 2 , Big Master 2 .
We should be running out of time !
Well , we killed eight people by hand .
Here we &apos;re looking at two old Hilly Capters , and we &apos;re still seeing blue algae .
Rover . They &apos;re on my side .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God bless you , bless you . Little good . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julian Sanging : The people who worked on it had a very strong effect on it .
We finally did two more research on this .
It was the first of three wars that actually happened .
CA : So 11 people in this campaign , right ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! The two employees of the Reuters , two young children were kidnapped .
In total , 18 to 26 people died .
CA : And then a lot of times after that .
What was the key reason why you thought it was so difficult ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as very unequal as energy .
On the one hand , some people are going into the village , and then a kilometer away from the neighborhood , the Hilly Capter begins to cover 30 miles of gallons per acre on everyone — any number of them — and they &apos;re also saving lives .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t even aware of anything , because they were journalists .
CA : The United States Defense Department received Broadline Management , and it &apos;s been said that he acknowledged in the State Rome that he made this video to you about 280,000 and a half American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanging : So we decided to accept the officials .
It &apos;s been estimated five days ago , to get 150,000 documents and to do 50 .
But we &apos;ve now given them what they did at the beginning of the year in Rio and the United States Senate , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of consultants from the U.S.
Julian Asanga : We give them what we do . ( CA : Y &apos;all do ? ) Julian Asanga : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Asanga : Because these things show that , in fact , what are the Arab states , the real issues of human rights in those states .
If you look at the hidden documents , the material is in them .
CA : You &apos;re talking about it .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy normally ?
Why is it right to create hidden information ?
Julian Asanga : So the question is how important information in the world is , what information can be repaired .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when information is supposed to be put out there , because governments know better , and they know better , they also care about how it &apos;s done .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks to this as individually or collectively previous societies , where innovation doesn &apos;t seem unexpected ?
Julian Sanging : We did not do anything with them .
I mean , our biggest hurdle is our job .
With data , we &apos;re sampling in a very specific way the information that &apos;s being produced — the information that &apos;s available to somebody else .
But there are also some awards . For example , your doctor has your data ; it &apos;s awesome — but we &apos;re talking about service providers that come in and out of nowhere .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing this with national attention .
And what you would say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is in the United States Senate , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something that some people like to call others .
It shows an American science of dead people .
Which has impacted — but it has made millions of people worldwide that the United States is a fair game .
If they &apos;re not , my daughter &apos;s not , who are you going to say ? What would you say ?
Julian Sanging : There are many questions like this .
But remember , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions , it doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions .
Because the Russians see it all .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and mindsets that give us numbers , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you &apos;re looking at hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are missing information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be funny for you to look at this light , you have to look at your own consciousness as well ?
Julian Asanga : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not all different imaginations .
We don &apos;t have the same intellect as the other genius .
If they do this , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to increase the function further apart .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , what we &apos;ve done is — let &apos;s talk about it here from analysts .
You can also predict that there will be different kinds of reasons about the law and the law .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or the problem .
What is the view of the Eurozone ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! Somebody must be right .
Chris Anderson : These are really good people , really good people .
We &apos;re going to have to try and do another experiment .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
So this is a very interesting story , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanging : This is an example of the work that we do almost every day .
So at the end of last year — there &apos;s been a lot of important rainfall in November , like the Gulf in Mexico , but not so much .
And we had a report — which was a very nice experiment about it — which I was told was that in fact , conservation workers had a different attack on oil , and they had stopped there and they had stopped .
And there was something about the federal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that surface . So this was a very difficult job for us .
We couldn &apos;t believe it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and who it was about .
So we wondered , maybe this is a company that &apos;s playing all this against .
We did this on the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we have no idea about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
This material is good , and it sounds good to watch , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the exact same week that he wrote , and he wanted to look at the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Wow , we want to look at the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we need to look at it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legal for this ?
Is this really who you are ? &quot; &quot; And they brought us this brand that we think of as Scripture with the name of industrial technology with microfluorescent DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
This is a way of revealing and believing what material is , and that is to try to write with these people .
CA : All right . So is some information from BP ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re going to collect multiple and multiple steps as difficult as possible .
Our explanation for this has gotten somewhat more easy in a few months because we &apos;re making our pockets better because of the rare global material that we have .
It &apos;s embarrassing .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing out , more of our capability has been buried at us because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in the population , very smart , but we don &apos;t have people who can arrange and trust this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , why are there so many people who are journalists or journalists ?
Julian Asanga : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very hard to solve very quickly , because the materials that we have in the middle , we have to organize so that we can get people together , we have to work very , very , very hard on the materials of conservation , and then less sensitive to business .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movie business , and then moving away from the bridge , so that &apos;s why these two existence influences ...
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean , a psychologist would say that all things together can produce a difference .
( Applause ) JS : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were a young hero and you were in the middle of a lot of hard work .
Julian Asanga : Yes , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I wrote a letter back then that when this crime hit me .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a method that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian magicians who are using your grandmother &apos;s banks .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not the same as it was before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s banker , but what do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some reality in your life that has helped them survive ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : good , powerful and evil people are not producing influence ; they &apos;re growing up .
And that &apos;s the reason I learned from my father and some other powerful and healthy people that live in my life .
CA : Brilliant and powerful people aren &apos;t producing influence ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a dumb man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing up , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of growing influencers , which is closer to the police .
And that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s been around my career for so long .
CA : So we &apos;ve only recently asked this question : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then the newspapers there have been silenced about your own story .
Instead , they inspired your position .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re so famous in Austria . So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , it &apos;s a great reality . You know .
Ace Lindland missed an economic crisis .
There was the most powerful one .
The banks here grew to 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that in July last year .
And the rule of thorium television set about five minutes before it was published , like a movie : &quot; The Graduate New York Times , &quot; and the situation of the New Reader was , &quot; That &apos;s never happened to us before . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-lapse all the time , and we became very famous in Austria , I went to Austria and talked about this issue .
And the part of the people there was that this shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , Six hundred scientists in Austria , working with other international experts , we lobbied a law called Austria Linda , which is why Freedom Media , the world &apos;s most protective neighborhoods , has a free heart .
A Norden country is like a fire , which is heading up from the bottom of the system .
And then a month ago , Austria &apos;s parliament adopted this properly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look into the future , do you realize that it &apos;s much more expected to show energy and energy , greater resilience , or are we going to see energy , or is it going to kill us ?
Julian Sanging : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will come from .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more push to accept the law of freedom and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the United States .
What &apos;s going to happen ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very interesting time to live — because with a small effort , we can fall aside from one side or the other .
Chris Anderson : Well it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience to say , geeks , geeks , and all the energy for you .
Julian Sang : Thank you , Chris Anderson : Thank you . ( Applause )
I was a child .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was totally in the game .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching both .
So I was doing this as a master &apos;s degree .
I walked past my childhood Connecticut yards and I watched them walk across the streets .
When I got older and got home in the early 1990s , I got bored .
My team was stuck .
And when I looked at it from a funny sort of personal point of view , I thought , how do the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the Malaysian Mountains everywhere , certainly North Carolina , Persia , or in London , there were four species that were blown up in the mountains — good , dark , silent and code .
And I thought this was a big strange thing , and I was surprised to see if anybody else had ever gotten a copy of this educational model .
And when I got into it , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching these Catholic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To limit the cognitive world into a few elements is no unusual human character .
This is something that we did 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at tissues 10,000 years ago , they &apos;re going to look at you as being radioactive and magnificent , you &apos;re going to look at every organism like this .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : soap , coal , cattle and roll .
It &apos;s also true of seniors .
You look at New York City &apos;s crossword puzzle 150 or 200 years ago , and you look at the crossword puzzle as a cartoon , puzzle and puzzle .
But if you look at the distance , you &apos;re only going to be four years old — the distance , the distance , the distance , the distance .
It understands that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to our history ?
Shah .
This is a brand new problem .
For the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been messing around like this .
The second great warrior challenged us to become the weapons .
During the great war , we developed technologies like soap operas , polymers and so forth , all of these things have been put into play .
And since the end of the Second World War , there have been four major breakthroughs to the end of the Great Depression .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that armed farming has increased happiness , and within a couple of years its origins have grown exponentially .
Now if you collect armed military and military conflicts , this will be the equivalent of two Chinese citizens every year .
My favorite example of the Chinese Constitution is not one , because China is not one of the biggest civil wars , but also the largest army .
Let &apos;s now turn to our four chapters .
First of all , in the United States and West , the most smooth food is the same .
The forest canopy is an extraordinary misleader .
Only a decaded jungle takes five , 10 , 15 pounds to get to market .
The Indus script is also unbelievable .
In a study done in Delhi University , it turns out that methane from a household cleaner does not work .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That in the remote outpost of the Gulf , they are the Gulf of Mongolia .
Now look at these nice little boxes .
They document the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protecting the coast , mining and mining children , all of the important things for the environment .
Some of this has happened with the Gulf of Mongolia .
Over the last 30 or 40 years , we &apos;ve launched millions of coastal plants .
A second procedure which is here , which is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; the neocortex . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen that by the time you look at the Tropical River , it &apos;s very relevant .
Now , there are some things that are already happening that are starting to deteriorate from the retina , but with it , there &apos;s a huge amount of other mosquitos that then switch on to the retreat .
And many times , it &apos;s been done by the slaves , by the name of the jihad , by the name of the jihad , by the name of &quot; &quot; Red . &quot; &quot; This is the tragedy that we would like to look at on the railroad , which means that the ecosystem of the ecosystem is eating itself and creating cool .
After that , the United States and the West have a second big movement .
Tunisia is a global tragedy .
The tuna has to look at a lot of places to organize like this .
We &apos;re in our area called the International Monetary Architecture or the ICCAT . The International Monetary Protection Center .
Carl Saveen also set out to be a great advocate of reading all technology .
We can take tuna , but tuna doesn &apos;t have good tuna .
Too many people don &apos;t know , but tuna &apos;s warm blood .
It can span over 40 miles a gallon and heat up to 20 dollars a lot more heat around its environment .
All of the benefits of metal are closed .
A fresh blood vessel is filled with blood which doesn &apos;t seem very good .
This is a good protein .
But the foreign object 40 miles away from home is not able to stay in the air .
Similarly , a good deal has been dead , it doesn &apos;t need to be dead .
This is my political context .
Connecticut was leaving the forest floor .
If you look at the context , each dot has to be an office .
There are more than 3,000 in the politics of Connecticut .
In fact , I say that people in Connecticut are larger — ( Laughter ) if anyone turns on the power of a contact girl , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere we go , these are the rockets that propel the kids of Somalia to initiate .
As a result , we have a success in winning and peaceful marriage .
When Noah started hunting , Sami was saving six pounds of forest floor to create a foundation .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
On the contrary , this is a typical false paper , because if you Google Freeman &apos;s Facebook , they don &apos;t belong to a foundation on Facebook .
Now , this is a feedback loop .
They say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go for a dollar and go for a loan . &quot; &quot; Vermeer &apos;s talk is hard to say .
But then again , the credit card industry says he has to go beyond the F-pound model .
This is a system that &apos;s producing oxytocin that &apos;s floating through the atmosphere .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the year .
Even though we &apos;re spending less money on getting to market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money .
Not only do we feed the mysteries , but we feed the men and women .
We have the kind of cool stuff that makes the sculpture , and there &apos;s the kind of cool stuff that &apos;s going on .
Because on top of it , the blood and hands add up to the knees .
I &apos;m also surprised to see if there &apos;s anything else that &apos;s been missing , but that &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
( Laughter ) This is a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of forest creatures that are being taken out of the sea and taken out of the sea .
This is the third part of China , or the number of people in the United States who get out of bed every year .
The last thing in four parts is this .
Philosynthesis actually started as lips .
And it started with a local entrepreneur who saw that the next day , no one was on the Mike Donalds .
She walked around and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Okay .
It was a demonstration that the Huli wouldn &apos;t be able to survive .
So he built his lip sonar .
Sandrine was 30 cents .
So he wanted to make a 25-centimeter census , so he set up the Titanic code .
The whole photosynthetic cellulose is the largest mega-industry in the United States , moving from two to three billion pounds of compost each year .
If we stop polling , perhaps a future election might be trivial .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It turns the plasma protein into a very powerful way in the animal protein , and it &apos;s good for the third world .
In fact , this is a very ambitious solution that &apos;s coming out of an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a dirty shape .
It doesn &apos;t have the iPods and DVDs that we think will live us all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That predicts a large part of 20 million tons .
One possibility that conservation needs to suggest is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of daring ?
There &apos;s evidence for this .
They have a happy childhood in the marketplace , where the average amount of employment is at the top of Indian price .
It &apos;s also a great metaphor for OMG 3 , EPA and DNA .
So that &apos;s its capacity .
But what if instead of just picking up a few dollars a pound or a pound or a foot tune and turning it into a Facebook page , we could crowdsource a pool and charge a gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet gourmet ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are particularly important .
They have much more EPAA and DVD .
Accounting Einstein is extremely effective .
The revenue from India to the market is only three percent .
Actually , about three of them don &apos;t come from garbage .
The salamander creates three vertical axis , and in the ammonia they only get together .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our ancestor has been transformed by the use of Facebook and Netflix .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , which is a very large cause of death in Somalia .
As you might think about clicks , there are more protein in all these different sections , and there are more than three that are highly effective .
It &apos;s absolutely original .
And the other puzzle is a question mark .
We can generate a classroom that can benefit us from metabolizing sperm .
These creatures should be green , growing fast and changing environments will have their own capabilities , and they should be EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and Fitch East .
It &apos;s still in the food .
I &apos;ve been conducting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it .
But try to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is about 30 million in the universe .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to understand without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to take a long time .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was too big to study the brain because I have a brother who is a schizophrenia .
More recently , I wanted to understand , as a community , how do I put my dreams back from my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , he doesn &apos;t divide his dreams from the public and from the truth , and he &apos;s on his way .
So I stopped looking for intense mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my parents &apos; office in India , where I worked for Dr. Frankenstein Bank , who was a professor of Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in people &apos;s brains that generally seek answers to differentiate than in people &apos;s brains that are affected by schizophrenia or by BBC ? So in fact , we &apos;ve been trying to create the microbial signal of the brain , which cells are delivering , &quot; &quot; What are the cells with the chemistry , &quot; &quot; and how much are they doing with the chemistry ?
So I had a lot of advice in my life because I did this research on the part of the day . &quot; &quot; But Noam and I were four weeks old , and I was going to National Agency to take this NAMI mission .
But December 10 , 1996 , I &apos;m going to find out that I &apos;m a smart driver .
The left part of my brain was a lion .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely disappear from the ability to understand information .
Falling in the morning was hard to read and remember something .
I was a sleeping child in the body of women .
If you ever look at the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the last part of the brain that &apos;s touched with the left part of the brain , and it &apos;s going to be held in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of it that are completely identical to one another .
For those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain operates like a series processor .
Those two sides send messages back to the Korean community that are connected to 300 grandchildren .
But the two parts are completely different .
Because they think of information in a different way , the subjectivity of each part has a very different understanding of the subjectivity of the subjects , and you allow them to appreciate the subjects of each other .
Congratulations . Thank you very much .
Audience : Yes , it &apos;s too much .
( Laughter ) Our brain &apos;s evidence is just right now and thinking about this .
Now , at this point , the evidence for our brains is reflected in musical form by our physiology .
Information comes into the body and it improves the throughput of our entire nervous system , and then it falls into a giant aluminum cloud that tells us what exists in the presence of the space and what is in the mind to feel and what is in the mind .
I am an energy that &apos;s driven by the energy of my neighbors by the sensitivity of the right brain .
We are the energy systems that are moving from one another , from the lower left of the brain to the human family .
And at this point , we are the brilliant brothers of this planet whose generosity is making the world better .
And at this point , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
Our brain is thinking differently and systematically .
The rest of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that we take the great album , the Class , and we begin to process it and then assemble the tests .
And it also informs the organization and the context of all the things that are happening in the past , all the things that we &apos;ve ever learned , and the potential of the future , namely , will have an impact on our projects .
Our left brain is thinking of language .
It &apos;s a conversation about what makes us and our inner world beyond the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me how to buy you home .
I need them in the morning ; it &apos;s a sense of making a book that reminds me of the book I read .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; &quot; I ! I !
And just like my left brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become very justice .
I become one of the only people in the world who has access to incredible energy and waste from you .
And the same part of my brain happened this morning from the Full campaign .
On the morning of the campaign , my eyes turned to me in the back of my eye with a stick of pain .
It was as painful as the Aristotle did .
And that pain just dragged me around and left .
And then it broke down and then it broke down .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never had any suffering , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No way , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to the swimming pool and I put on my cardboard guided , which is the early physical exercise machine .
Now I &apos;m flying over this mechanism , and I feel like my hand is just the tip of a primitive human being that touched Donna .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , this sounds so weird and weird . &quot; &quot; And it seems like my perception has changed , which is the general sense of truth in which I &apos;m a human being , which is moving from this experience , but now I &apos;ve been somewhere hidden and hidden where my sense of
And it was all very strange and poor , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started screaming in the room , and I felt like everything was going on inside my body .
And the crocodile understands a lot of pressure .
There &apos;s no connection in my speed , and I think there &apos;s a household problem , so my goal is to just focus on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my house watering the water bottom , and I &apos;m actually speaking to my body .
I heard a sound that said , and my foot has to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then my balance goes up , and I roll up and down the wall .
I sit down and I look at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t repair my body &apos;s limitations anymore .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand is held by Tom and McNally and Tom and McNally .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ?
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And so the rest of my brain got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice on a regular computer .
A blood vessel .
First , I was fascinated by the mystery of my brain .
But then it was as immediately as in this huge space flight that was right next to me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body right now , I felt the power and the power of my body .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel went to the left of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; You know , there &apos;s no problem . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I told myself I &apos;m really bored with a problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really bored with a problem , but I immediately came back with a sense of what I say a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Consider how beautiful it would be if you were completely involved with this fragile brain that keeps you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my sleeping and my stress responds .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And measure all of your relationships from the outside world and any of them have gone missing .
And I felt a sense of security .
And measure what it would look like if instead of hiding , this 70-year-old emotional weight that you had left .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a seminar .
It was lovely .
And then the left part of my brain went , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , wait a minute .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking I should be helpful , so I &apos;m coming home from the closet , and I &apos;m putting myself in my apartment right now , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive a car ? &quot; &quot; And this is why my mother has absolutely blown my hand up .
I was reminded of that moment that my God had given me the battle of Judaism , the next thing that my mind tells me is how magnificent it is .
( Laughter ) How amazing !
How many brain researchers are going to miss the opportunity to realize that they can counteract their own brain , and they can . ( Laughter ) Then one blood came to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a woman of color . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to waste . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t fix the golf cart , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll get back to my basement . Okay .
I should be calling for help . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job , and then I remembered that I had my pension , which is my phone number .
Then I go into my studio and I create a three-inch card installation .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card as I can see from my own brain &apos;s eye what my nose looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this card isn &apos;t my fault , because I don &apos;t look at the exact same points .
And the words would be helpful from point of paper and point of view , and I was not learning anything .
And then I started waiting for him to say goodbye to me .
And at that point , the public was repeated again , and I was learning that this is not a card , this is not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to break even .
And at that time , the effects of the 45-minute flood were increasing in the left-hand side .
I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have a way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took a bananas card and I put it here , and now I &apos;m looking at the cards as big as the big bubbles on the phone .
But then I turn to my bell when I was walking back , and I don &apos;t remember putting that spring in .
So I grabbed my hand like a doll and stuck it in the Indian , and I told the girls by the other hand , that when I came back to the public truth , I could tell myself I was going to come back to India for a while , and I ended up meeting all over India , and I heard that a woman turned on the phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow . Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I
So I say to her , very clearly in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking about you . I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Woo hoo hoo , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m also talking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then he turns me down , which I didn &apos;t know was that I couldn &apos;t speak a language until then , and I don &apos;t understand until I try to speak .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And after a little while , in one ambulance , Sierra Leone was running from one hospital to another .
I walked up and looked like a child of a small child .
Just like the one cloud that keeps falling apart from all the richness , I pulled the energy out and I felt my soul giving the weight away .
And that &apos;s when I realized I wasn &apos;t choosing my life .
Or the doctor would save me and give me the opportunity for my second life or the opportunity for my transport .
By the time I got there , I was surprised that I was alive .
When I felt my soul , I gave life to God .
Now my brain was divided into two different facts .
At that time , the emotional movement of my perceptual system was beginning to become more than just a sense of pain .
Lightning lit my brain like a forest fire , and the lightning bolt and the lightning bolt bolted out that I was missing a voice , or I was missing a voice .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize the plasticity of my body , so I felt enormous and enormous , like someone who had just gotten rid of their belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great heroic event in the middle of nowhere .
Great ethos .
I had the quality that mattered .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I could find my greatest appreciation of the presence of a small body .
But that &apos;s when I realized , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m also living !
I &apos;m alive now , and I &apos;ve been brought to sleep .
And if I am brought to sleep , and I am alive , then whatever life is , I can have the neurons , and I &apos;ve seen the world filled with people with beauty , compassion , compassion and love that they know can someday feel that quality .
And they can go ahead and pick it up , and the right thing is that they want to put the books on the left side of their brain to stick their feet in search of this primitive quality .
And then I understood how incredible this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What is this image that he taught me to live his life ?
And he gave me permission to be healthy .
After hundreds of years of fighting this war , I took blood from my brain that was the equivalent of a golf cart that was trapped at the center of the brain &apos;s safety .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life , the power of life with two very specific brains .
And we have the power to choose and not to choose who we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can stand at the right side of my consciousness at the same time . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s where we are .
I am the energy of life in the universe ; I am the energy of life .
Fifty beautiful mammalian cells are made of a matriarch , one in which all of them are .
Or I can choose to stand on the left side of my consciousness where I become an individual , in a flat form .
Don &apos;t be fooled .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .

Good morning !
Are you going to go ?
They took my name to the Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young age ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and was expected to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have a free lunch in Arabic ?
He looks at me strangely , thinks he must have misunderstood .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Feeling in Arabic , compassion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; Minister , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Boy said .
He was talking to me about three people , as he said to you , &quot; If this is the next girl in the world , I don &apos;t see it ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; Minna &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager mounted a girl in two words , and ignored her .
How can they speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got angry about that .
Sure enough .
What is it about me that I &apos;m privileged to speak my language in my country ?
Where does it happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there &apos;s a lot of people like me , who come to this stage in their life , where they literally leave everything that &apos;s in their mind , just because they love it and they &apos;re depressed .
Do I want to drive all my culture , all my ideas , opinions and aspirations ?
We may have the most important battle in children &apos;s stories .
Do they want to give me everything I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What makes sense ?
Despite that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that kind of religious decision for what it was for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t cover the needs of today .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or research , or language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we observe when we work on a project of interdisciplinary research , and it &apos;s certainly not a language that we use at WHO .
If we do that , they will outcaste us .
So where can I use it ? We can all ask these questions !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the mother language .
Research says that in other languages , you have to struggle with your mother tongue .
In other languages , creativity is the primary condition for language expression .
How ?
Governor Governor , when he started writing before , used Arabic .
All of their imaginations , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little girl in the village where she grew up , felt a special feeling , felt a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their text in English , you feel the same sense of happiness , you feel the same sense .
You can imagine that these are also in English , this little boy who lived in the jungles , living in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emergent societies happen .
Crime , France , Japan and China , they &apos;re all very well known .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the walls , they spend a lot of money on the dissemination and so on .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this developed mindset is not yet available to us , and we want to get to this developing world .
The countries that were like us at the time , but decided to try and push for progress , research , and move to those countries , such as agriculture , employment and so forth , they were able to engage their language as the girls were leaving , as the heroes were .
They kept it close to themselves .
Because if you take Turkish or whom and your products and you don &apos;t write on it in a magazine , it &apos;s not local products .
You won &apos;t believe that these are local products .
And they will be joined in these creators , innocent inventors , like we are most of the time .
So to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Religion , automation , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would that mean ?
No matter who , how and how .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a symbol of the particular stages in our lives , and the words that are separated from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Religion , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you is going to create a special circuit in your brain . There are special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of joining one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that we think about , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What are our minds ?
How would you say you understood it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the Freedom of English ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , well , I &apos;ll go ahead and spend a lot of time talking about it .
The point is that these affections remind us of a particular thing .
A friend of mine is a French speaker , who &apos;s from a French speaker .
I was asking it already .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I woke up to try and translate his wife one night to try and figure out what &quot; &quot; humiliation &quot; &quot; means . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A woman called her &quot; &quot; humiliation , &quot; &quot; and then spent all night trying to figure it out .
He wondered , how can one be so innocent ?
Do they want to self-assemble ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It makes us feel that he doesn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; his way of thinking is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to me at night , and one night , I tried to translate to him to feel what I felt when I heard February . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate that , &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it was obvious : because you were me , I put my hands together and you left . &quot; ( Laughter )
It &apos;s translated . It &apos;s pushed me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to confront the Arabic language ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started the Library of Arabic language .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Leave the cold , slow down . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Library of Arabic-speaking has made a promise , which is , &quot; I talk to you in the East , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t take this approach because , like that , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody tells me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be steeped in the way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives change .
The letter is the same as ours and the same as ours .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you in the East , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; Get it right .
Very simple but nice and effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , a context in which the letter is in the yellow and blue tape houses , with the text , &quot; Stop killing the language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very easy to play with the opportunity to be innovative and innovative .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; The Coal &quot; &quot; photos of girls and boys .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; college . &quot; &quot; They want to confirm how much they want to confirm , but I have to convey the word that &apos;s good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; The Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these aren &apos;t museums ! We don &apos;t have to hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we need to convince everybody that we &apos;re not going to let anyone become greater or think that we have the capacity to overcome language , to push us , to push ourselves , to push our patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the skin , we can still be creative .
Right now , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in the native language .
Let &apos;s start today .
They write a note or make a short film .
A single node can fit us on a global level again .
He can re-branch the Arabic language .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we need to know that , and we need to believe that there is a solution , that we have to be part of the solution .
In honor , what can you do today ?
Who are you Twittering ?
For Judaism , I recommend you , though , my time is up , either Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin word !
( Applause ) This is disappearing ! This is not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a magical world with a lexicon .
It &apos;s not easy to go back there and be large .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to confront each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child for the first time has known its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say that , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey , honey . &quot; &quot; And I promised my daughter that in the marketplace , if she would say to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say
And it &apos;s not expected that nobody &apos;s going to hear it . ( Applause ) You &apos;ve got this culture of copyright friction . ( Applause )
I speak a little English speaker to us , to remind us that this is not a secret to our current situation , but I &apos;ve been reminded of the negative patterns that have been poisoning to my people , until you see me without the banking of my generation , I &apos;ve been reminded of this generation of inequality , not until they &apos;re celebrating our generation until they &apos;re celebrat@@
( Applause )
I like chocolate data .
In college , my primary attorney was Germany , which meant I had to write multiple documents .
Now , when a regular person writes something , this approach will work .
You know ... ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll start your job at a low speed , but in the first week , you do a lot of work and more work later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s done . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
I &apos;m going to get all the stuff done , but actually I &apos;m going to get the text work on the top , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with every text function .
And then I came up with a whole new paper of research papers , the text work you do in a year .
And I knew that my common denominator was not an option for this type of action .
It was a huge task .
I planned , I decided I would do something like this .
Something like this will happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , in the middle months , the speed of work is going to go up , and eventually I &apos;m going to make it bigger , just like a puzzle .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Come back and forth , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by , which changed in two weeks .
And then one day , I went and there were three days in the video online , and I didn &apos;t even write a word yet , and then what I could do was , 72 hours , I wrote 90 pages , two streets , two streets , two streets , no longer have to go for two streets to include people , one click click click in the campus , one click out of time , and the DVD is done .
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you trustworthy ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to talk about your argument . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; From now on , it &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very angry . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write a blog , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about cheese .
My route always costs me six people , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the human brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that simple people &apos;s brains make a difference between six .
So to find out , I made a leaf blood vessel where I could put both of these brains in the right way and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look very closely and say , there &apos;s been a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so obvious , but consider it .
So this is a sixth person in the brain .
( Laughter ) Now .
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the rest of the human brain is fun .
Now what does that mean in terms of a string ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; This is the best time for the campaign &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart human decision is to make some sense of what it means , but the president doesn &apos;t like the project , so he hears the headline , and he says , &quot; &quot; Keep reading the front page of the chart . &quot; &quot; Tennis and Tony Hadfield , because I know it &apos;s happening right now .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;re going to go to the puzzle , and see if something new has happened in 10 minutes ?
After that , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which starts with a conversation about the theme of the World Fund , and much later , it &apos;s going to end up watching television on the Mother Nature .
( Laughter ) It will take a while to do all of these things , so there won &apos;t be any time to do anything else today .
What &apos;s going to happen ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the foundation of philanthropy that you want to say .
It just wants to be present .
It doesn &apos;t have any sense of the future , it &apos;s just two things : soft and excitement .
In the animal world , that &apos;s fine .
If you say and you spend your entire life going forward , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And for profit , human animals are a generation .
Good food , good thought , and increased generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened in the suburbs .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , the tribe is no longer far .
We are an advanced religion , and yet we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who allows us to do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re giving away .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is to do what we enjoy doing .
Sometimes the guards seem to be right that they do what is easily and enthusiastic about eating , sleeping or enthusiastic about opportunity .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a stigma .
Sometimes they agree .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate for them to do what &apos;s difficult .
And that &apos;s the stigma .
And for strangers , this contradiction always leads to an end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet , easy and expensive way that reasons are outside .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) Dark field is the place where strangers are well-known .
This is where employment comes when it &apos;s not supposed to be a leader .
In the dark fields that you find , in fact , it &apos;s no longer the case because it &apos;s not the right , it &apos;s rooted in with feelings of crime , fear , anxiety , and self-hatred — all the qualities that are in good shape .
The question is , in this case , when capital punishment breaks down , how do you deal with solidarity , which is unfortunately important ?
It turns out that hundreds of people are also conservationists , who are always protecting it at a certain point in time — someone called the homeowner .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly comfortable , but when the data gets closer , it becomes awesome , or at the same time when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the cheese just flows like this .
Now I had this relationship with my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and founded me a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My wish was to participate in TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and anger , something else was happening in the brain that was making decisions .
He was saying , &quot; Do you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . The principal said , &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we just Google and see the Indian peak at the bottom of India and see the Indian peak for 2,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the pilgrimage till we see all of India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a month later , people at TED decided they wanted to name the Koran .
I downloaded the Web and the photograph of me holding onto it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house was controlled , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the homework he was afraid of . He was fine on the tree !
And finally , finally , long-term decision makers sent in and I can start talking .
Now , the homework assignment that explains all sorts of disabled packaging , how someone like me would spend two weeks trying to figure out how to browse and not write an article about the beginning of the article , and then incredibly hard work leads to unbelievable contradictions to go and write an article all night long .
And three clear-cut containers now call the system of sixth-graders .
It &apos;s very good , not very affordable .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the impressions of it .
In fact , I got thousands of emails from all over the world and all sorts of people who were responsible for various types of ties .
They included the novels , the bankers , the engineers , the funders , and the big CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost the same thing was said and wrote : &quot; I &apos;m also confronted by this mess . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails in the email account and the number of emails .
He was lying in the text of these people , writing about how much longer he spent in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are they all in black ?
Turns out , there are two layers on the right .
The examples I gave you today , which were all about issues , were all data lines .
And when the data is online , the recent impacts are crucial because the homework assignments that come in .
But there &apos;s another kind of trend on the right , and it &apos;s not from any data line .
So if you want a job that you start yourself like some arts or businesses — like some arts or businesses , until you don &apos;t start your car reading fast , just to keep doing things .
In addition to the work , there are many other things that David Lunner is not fighting , like meeting his family , practicing , keeping your health , believing in your relationships , telling your relationships that you can &apos;t fight .
Now if the only way to work is through household tinfoil , that &apos;s hard , because all these data lines in construction , households that are lost .
It has nothing to do . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of long tradition that comes to see too little and talks about less than just the usual , confused primary attributes .
You are suffering from impunity and suffering from impunity .
And it can be the ultimate masterpiece of paper and retrieval .
So I thought , that &apos;s why they &apos;re emailing , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
They &apos;re not meant to plan .
The Taliban recruited them , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot afford to pay for their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email , and one thing came out , I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are mad .
You may not have that complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of you in the audience have good relationships with online , but remember the patterns of the web when there &apos;s no DVD .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been hacked .
I think we all need to go beyond this curriculum .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing , because in every life , nobody &apos;s ever been able to do it .
We need to be careful in the face of philanthropy .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that house on it , so maybe we should just start .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days in the U.S. and Afghanistan , a handful of Afghan Afghans were stepping out of an area in Afghanistan , stepping out of an area in Afghanistan so that Afghan prosecutors could help to provide a fund to protect an Afghan service so that Afghan prosecutors could help to provide a fund to protect Afghan prosecutors from the Afghan prosecutors who were forced to fight
He came in at the end of an invasion , and he was surrounded by three and a lot of stuff , and he was watched as a child by the time Captain Sweden was kidnapped when he was born , so he could save the victims and remove the dead people .
One surgeon and one of the other surgeons in the class was growing up towards a Hilly cafeteria , and he was also growing up towards a Hilly cafeteria .
It turns out that the Kepin Switzerland and Ice Shepherd boy take this kind of warm , gloomy oil spill .
They put it into the Hilly cafeteria , and then you see what the captain sounds like and they pay for it before they can rescue others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? It &apos;s an incredible feeling when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a loving one , and I wanted to know why I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , I &apos;m welcomed on the Tuesday to those who wish to sacrifice themselves so that others can benefit .
In business , we put bonds on people who want to try to hurt others so that we can benefit .
We have the electronics !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that they were just better people than others .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re hitting the sun .
These are the best people who are looking forward to this vision of services . These are the best people who are looking forward to this vision of services .
But it &apos;s totally wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have a temperate environment , each of us has the capacity to work together , so each of us has the capacity to work together and amplify it and have the capacity to do that within others .
I have the great privilege of meeting some of these people , whereas we would say every day , I have the great privilege of meeting some of these people , whereas we would say yesterday , they would put you and your animals at risk to be able to save others , and I asked you , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not just artifacts .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about me , &quot; &quot; and you do .
It may not be that I give two people the chance to collaborate and do that .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does that aspiration come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to the Pearthquake , the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , these are all factors that are very important to us .
Nothing personal .
Whether it &apos;s a waste of resources , it &apos;s a long-term travel , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce the longevity of our lives , it &apos;s all working together to reduce the longevity of our lives .
And so we &apos;re ready for social animals where we &apos;re together and work together as part of what I call a spirituality , as in a closet where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt preserved in ourselves , cooperation was a natural response .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can go to sleep at night and I can swim and I can look at some of my neighbors .
If we don &apos;t spend it on each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t spend it on you , it means you &apos;re not going to look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
These worlds are faced with risk , things that are trying to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
These are economies that may have grown so much , that the stock market can be unbelievable .
It can be a new technology that will disrupt your business landscape overnight , it can be a new technology that will disrupt your business landscape overnight .
Or you may have a fight that sometimes tries to hurt you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but at least it stops your growth and it tries to take your businesses away from you , it stops your growth and it tries to push your business forward .
We have no control over those forces .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never stop .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the intensity is , because that belief is the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect and protect the lives of the people in his organization , the lives of the people in his organization and the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to encourage their peaceful and sincere results so that people are there and that they sacrifice their peaceful and sincere results so that people can feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , the valuable
I was on a one-way trip , and I noticed an event when a traveler had tried to leave before he found it , and I saw the stakeholders on the door just like he passed the law as he was crying .
It was the first time I tried to leave it — the first time I tried to leave it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you making us jump like acids ?
Why can &apos;t you stay with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And soon he answered me exactly the same .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
It &apos;s not because we like to travel to Western Ireland , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re keeping allies .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t take care of their leaders .
You see , if conditions are broken , we spend our time and strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and strength protecting ourselves from one another , and that makes organization worse .
What a great leader is , for her , the closest example I can show is that being a parent is a good leader for her , and the closest example I can show is how to become a parent .
If you think about how good parents are , what do you want ? What does it do ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , control and record , when necessary , we want to give our children the opportunities , education , organization and record , when necessary , so that they can grow and get more of what we can do for themselves , so that they can grow and get more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s exactly what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , theory and record , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , theory and record , when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to have confidence , they want to have time and failure so that they can achieve greater achievements that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve greater achievements
Charlie Kim , who is the CEO of a technology company called Next Jump in New York City , Charlie Kim , who is the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump , in New York City , is saying that if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever stop a kid ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people out of our organization ? How do we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has lost practical employment . Charley has lost practical employment .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get to work on the basis of effective problems .
But if you have a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , exactly like we &apos;re going to do for our kids who come home from school and pick up the C-Grand .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers who are running through CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are left with severe frustration and anger , some of the bankers who are running through CEOs , that &apos;s why so many people are left with severe hatred and angry , some of the bankers who are unequally frustrated and motivated .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the basic principle of technology .
They &apos;ve solved a thriving social society .
We know that they have given their loved ones the victims of their loved ones , and we know that they have given their loved ones the children of their loved ones , but that they have given their loved ones the children of their loved ones , and that they have murdered their loved ones for their loved ones .
That &apos;s what we assume , not data .
Can anyone guess why they have invested 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is that a problem for us ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
Good leaders will never release people to save data .
Good leaders will never release people to save data .
Instead , they will give people skin data to save , but they will give people skin coverage to save .
Baby Chepp , who runs a mining company in the Midwest , leaves a mining company in Baby Cheps Media , which is called Barry Wehmiles in 2008 , who was running a great deal of shopkeepers and drove 30 percent of their drivers overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy a jar of jam .
They needed 10 million dollars to be saved , so people like many companies today are gathering together and doing illegal work .
And Bob rejected it .
You see , the Babylonian genocide is not convinced .
It also believes in the production of the polar bears , and the more difficult it is to reduce heart attacks and reduce heart attacks .
And then they built a dedicated program .
She had to take every job , every secretary , to the CEO , in four weeks without a break .
They could do it any time they wanted and didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob admitted to the program , it matters a lot .
He said it &apos;s better that we all get a little bit more painful than some of us get a lot more painful and suffer from it .
They have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as people might expect , when they feel protected from the wealth of an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And basically , like no one expected , people started businesses with each other .
The ones that were most successful they did business with low-success people .
So some people decided to give five holes to each other in three holes .
Journalism is an extreme , not a contradiction .
I know a lot of people who benefit from organizations &apos;s highest definitions , and I know a lot of people who benefit from organizations &apos;s highest definitions that aren &apos;t leaders at all .
They &apos;re locked up , and we do what they say because they have authority on us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people from all walks of organizations who don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re the real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and they have the courage to look at the person on the right , and they have the courage to look at the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the science that was going on out there in the theater , and as scientists use it as a way of cooking in honor and playing in front of their men and saving nothing for it .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some of his food so he could eat because that &apos;s what it is .
We call them leaders to start .
We call them leaders because they take risks first , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them the leaders because they choose to be the people to protect them , and we call them the leaders because they choose to be the people to protect them , we call them the leaders because they choose to be the people to protect them , and when we do that , the natural responsibility is to protect them .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and blood and blood to see if their leaders &apos; dreams are becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your pancreas and your body to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do that for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all want to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story of the Limpopo , which is the equivalent of Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where water and water are very unsafe , like climate , and growing up in these conditions is very difficult to reach the age of 17 , I was sleeping with friends in the temperate zone .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was standing in the corner , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; YR , why don &apos;t you invent something that &apos;s just on the skin and you shouldn &apos;t cut it ? &quot; &quot; I sat down , and I immediately went , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and found some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and they &apos;re only in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment called the most dangerous tragedy .
The reason that the Trachoma is blinded in the eye is because it &apos;s one of the most proliferating degenerations of the trachoma that you can endure .
It reduces the disease by eight million people every year , and the most amazing thing about it is that you only have to wake up from the tragedy : no boots , no clothes , no English .
After seeing these statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it at least because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I got an email from my brother from 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a browser for 20 seconds , I went to Google and I did some research
And I looked at this as a property problem .
So Mahammad said it &apos;s right , our formulas are ready .
Now we need to be careful .
Four years later , after I wrote down my patent on a 40-page business plan on mobile phones , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Not Enough ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say more than that . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mysterious exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a pencil .
( Laughter ) So after attempting to influence it in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Middle E.U. conventional wisdom brought in some new people , did this work , and now we have an effective paradox , which is ready for the stock market , now available .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy a lot of products .
They only buy what they need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a jar of jam in Alex , they buy a jar of jam every day , because that &apos;s how it works .
So we created DryBath in these creative little pieces .
You just push it between them and out .
And the best thing is , a simple inversion of a cage is only in five seconds .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about breaking products .
We even want DryBath , the sophisticated children of sensation up there . ( Laughter ) Once in less than a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , wherever they leave the garden and we could save two houses for children , which are in the ancient areas , two houses , more than two hours for school , two more houses for the children .
After seeing these global impacts , we &apos;ve taken it out of our core values , our cleanness and our responsibility .
DryBath is a rich man and a conservative man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually entering this process of being able to trade it into a multinational stage that can be transferred to the retail market , and one question for my collaborator today at the Limpopo Railway , with an aluminum of 50 ranks in a week to describe a way that the world cannot be censored .
Are you kidding ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot in this process , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest young man .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African to consider this accountability , and one thing that really amazes me is why all of these monks did not want to be honored . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to show you some of the results that have come out and I &apos;m also surprised by what are the main reasons why organizations succeed , which are actually why they succeed .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you select a group of people with equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find human capabilities which were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are so great , why often fail ?
So I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at first .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , to draw down many of my misconceptions and misconceptions that came from some of the companies in the last year .
I wanted to know this because I was starting at the age of 12 with a variety of different businesses that were coming from Yahli High School to Canada and all the way to school to solar-electric tools , then to college , when I made a radio spoofer .
When I got out of college , I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the leadership began , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve made more than 100 companies founding a lot of successes , and a lot of great failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to give theorists the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First , think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I named my company &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; is the last time you feel about it .
Through graduation , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to move forward or contract , are more important factors than I think .
I never thought it would be possible for the researcher here at TED to talk about mathematics , but once he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a plan for everybody , until I don &apos;t read a menu on me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team is very important in terms of their ability to identify the distance from the vehicle .
Car is an Italian reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about justice ?
With that in mind , it seemed to me that what is most important for success .
So think about innovation .
Sometimes companies get a huge investment .
Could that be the most important ?
After that , of course — is it time ?
Did this idea soon happen , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;re next , and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or so far , and already terrified ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of respect for these five factors in many organizations .
And the idea was to have 100 laptops of Libya , and 100 of them could have reached a scientific conclusion to try .
So first of these ideas on laptops , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com. — these are all dollars of achievement .
And the bottom five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — were hopeful for us , but not successful .
And then I tried to put all these characteristics , as I think these companies had promoted .
Then in leadership companies outside Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was tremendous investment in NGOs , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the greatest influence of all the success and failure of all the companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was choice of time .
Forty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other side , and then the idea , being different , being different , is actually number three .
But it &apos;s not really clear , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but I was surprised by looking at it and seeing it as not the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
The last two , I think , is business model and investment .
I think the market model doesn &apos;t work anymore , because you can start without the market model , and then when the product gets big in the village , include it .
And investment , if initially it was small , but now it &apos;s growing , especially today , is very easy to get investment .
I want to give you some examples here of all of these dots .
Take the big success of Airbnb , as you all know .
It turns out that a lot of investors looked at this company because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put some of their houses into a grocery store ? &quot;
Of course , it &apos;s been false .
One of the reasons why gross is successful is because of the best market model , the idea , and the market perspective is the right time .
This company came in front of these financial problems when people needed additional support , and it made sure that they could help people respond to the conventions that they were putting in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came to me , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
However , time was exactly right , making the taxpayers part of what they needed .
Dreaders were also demanding additional access ; it was very important .
Some achievements , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 , came back when companies wanted more grandmothers than grandmothers .
We thought it was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very hungry for it . With a lot of colleagues and a great marketing model , to work with the leading industry in Hollywood .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband Internet was very little .
It was very difficult to see online video , you had to download Code in your browser and don &apos;t know what to do , and finally this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and crashed over 50 percent in the United States , YouTube was the best time .
Great idea , the best of times .
The truth is that YouTube didn &apos;t have a business model when it started .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But she was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
Ideas matter .
But maybe time is too important .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really hungry for your birth .
And the thing about trustworthiness is that , if you don &apos;t like the results , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work very honestly in terms of changing time .
As I said earlier , initial organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully , some of those conversations are helpful at increasing the chances of your success , and then not in some of the best hope in the world .
Thank you very much , you &apos;re the best allies .

&#91; 3 April 2016 we saw the biggest data shark in history &#93; &#91; Financial Prime Minister mentioned aid and powerful people &#93; &#91; A lot of nonprofits run into multinational companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Robert Prize to the Gulf Wonders . &#93; &#91; Financial State this week was sitting at the center of the cultural organization that brou@@
The Financial State reported these articles as part of the small business secret companies .
We have found the inner stories of villages , banks and nurses coming in with forms like Morocco Finance and saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messages , you can look at how you do business , how they do things .
Their impact is already beginning to manifest .
The prime minister of the U.S.
We also have the news that Sunday Doctors are identical to the Alliance Sheep .
The revenue of two billion dollars to the President of Russia goes to the President of the Patent Point of his childhood companion , which is a famous secretary .
And a lot of smart people will be infected and still be at home with more blind documentaries than ever before .
Now this looks like a magical movie , or a violin story , with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that aggressive and powerful people are living in their own backyard , and while they &apos;re not supposed to be taxed , it means that pharmaceutical actions like girls are underpaid for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my company , the Global Vations , this is amazing .
The global media and political leadership are talking about how people have influenced the rape companies that we &apos;re talking about .
I think this is the world of privacy for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these laptops work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can join another company inside a company , another company inside , so it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind it .
For organizations that disrupt law , it &apos;s very difficult to understand why the press , the school , the school , is doing it .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that in the United States , we haven &apos;t heard that much about it .
Maybe it &apos;s because the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in R &amp; D .
That &apos;s why the Russian intelligence agencies are running , there &apos;s only a few of them in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we read about Kenyan Ireland innovations or Delhi View or Republican nominations , there are things that correlate with America .
But a lot of American politicians don &apos;t have to give you that information , you have to give you less information to run a company than you do with a library card .
In American schools , this kind of information is given to students .
Ninety-nine units of investment make it easy .
This kind of ritual affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Westerners , we wanted to see how the problem is .
How does it actually work ?
So what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve turned a petition into 13 U.S. legal companies .
Our foundation became an African minister who wanted to move to the South America to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The thing that was so striking about this was that all of the villagers presented a metaphor for how to move the village to the brain .
These were all primary meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our money without a lawyer , and we didn &apos;t give anybody any money , but it was a bad estimate .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individual law that has talked about our suspicious diminishment and our propositions .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
This is how the system works , which opens up the television , the television , the poverty and the infrastructure .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to have to change that game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be difficult to create these kinds of situations .
It might be intuitive , so that we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people who are smart and empowered will always be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been taking a leap in transparency where the capability of the company is .
This issue was solved on the political agenda , but the British Prime Minister of Defense declared 8 cents in the South East Land in 2013 .
And since then , European Union is creating a central record on a global scale , whether or not there are actually any companies in Europe that are controlling them .
The demonstration is that the E.U. is behind it .
The contrast in terms of the controversial legislation is the contrast in the center and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to have as much progress as we wanted , so we turned five .
They want to look at innovation , big secret companies , which were used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in the Gulf Ventinas .
We need to reach out to the people who know their loved ones behind barbershop companies .
You know , they speak up , and it &apos;s not good for us to be optimistic .
Politicians need to address this issue , and encourage the legitimate changes of access to information .
We can aggregate that tension , that tension , that tension , that tension , that tension , that tension , that tension .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Look , who invented your invention , has had a lot of sensory documents in the last few years that are more than all the media in the world .
Can it be true ?
JC : Yeah , can it be true ?
It &apos;s an investigation . What &apos;s not ? The media of the world is showing equally effective at producing a small group of employees to produce information that is more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people form documents ?
And how do you balance them ?
Julian Sanging : There you go . There you go . I can tell you , there &apos;s public service going on in the right way , and we have a lot of ways to get the information to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed storage to shift materials from one place to another on the Internet , to remove the signal from legal authorities like Sweden and blogging .
We get the information from the database , from ordinary databases , from Ross Square , or whatever , corporations like typical newspaper agencies , forming — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive amounts of information for the people , and then protecting yourself against the illegal and political stances .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that documents are real , but you never really know what the scale is .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ll always get it . And if we get to a stage , we quickly release the information .
( Gunshot ) God made it .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s obvious what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So that was Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julian Sanging : Yes . So this is the Koral report .
It was a private Magazine Report that the government of Kenya prepared in 2004 after the election .
Before 2004 , the government had turned 18 .
It was Kenya &apos;s onset of medical treatments .
And when it came to the power of the book — based on the authoritarian authorities who were trying to avoid the lawsuits of Kenya — they bought 20 million pounds of this report and another report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for its political will , which was the smartest guy — still the smartest guy in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why I went to Kenya in 2007 , and we were able to achieve the success of the first elections , first in December of 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after the new president &apos;s eye , Kabul decided to volunteer with the person who was horrified by Daniel Arp , so this report became Indian and we went to the Gulf of Mexico .
CA : And — So , I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s — I mean , it &apos;s not in Kenya , it &apos;s not in the rhetoric , but in the middle , and in your opinion , it changed the outcome .
GG : Yes . This is the heavy land of Guardian , and then it &apos;s spread across all of Kenya , in Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he , after a few months , trusted Kenya &apos;s intelligence agency to talk about it .
And this evening , 20 days on the TV in Kenya , changed 10 percent of the country &apos;s ratio , according to an online sex report , and the result of that was changed .
CA : Wow , so your secret view has really changed the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re going to show a little video of a little clip of a windmill .
This video is long . But here &apos;s a little clip .
This is — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart beating .
RD : It &apos;s hard , when you reach out to them and grab them .
I see , oh , there are four with them .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s fine . Golly &apos;s running .
When they &apos;re on your show , tell me . Go ahead .
All dollars .
Go ! Go !
( Mechanical noises ) Gold running . Gold running . ( Mechanical noises ) Gold running .
HP : Two six , six , six .
We have to go , time is up !
Okay , now we killed eight people .
Here we see two Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Rover . They &apos;re on my show .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what about society . What was happening ?
God bless you , Hell . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people arrested for it .
These were the first three cases that happened .
CA : So 11 people killed , right , two employees of the global Reuters ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two small children were kidnapped .
Twenty-five out of 18 were killed .
CA : And there was a lot of anger after that .
What was its primary cause , what do you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as the ultimate inequality of power .
On one side of the village , there are people who are forced to go one kilometer away , and a kilometer away from the Netherlands , where the Netherlands are starting to melt 30 miles of cattle on every single one of them — among many — and also killing their families .
They also had two journalists who were not absent because their profession was obsolete .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining got arrested , and it &apos;s said that he acknowledged that video had made you 280,000 and white American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
JC : So we decided to accept the document .
It &apos;s been tried on that a few days ago , and it took 150,000 documents and 50 .
But we &apos;ve done what we did at the beginning of the year , a documentary in Rwanda and an American sheriff , but there &apos;s nothing in it .
I mean , I often came to this office .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of documents for the U.S. subscription .
GG : We &apos;re giving them what we do . ( CA : Are you going to do it ? ) GG : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) GG : Because these things show that actually , like , what are the Arab states , the real violation of human rights in these governments .
If you look at the documents of this kind of material , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy normally ?
Why is it okay that you have access to information ?
Julian Shanning : Yes , the question is , what information is important in the world , what information can lead to .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
That information that organizations spend an enormous amount of money on is a good indication that when information comes out , it expands to do something good , because the organizations know it better , and they know the inner stories , they care how to fix it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there risks to it individually or collectively , which lead to unexpected societies ?
JC : We didn &apos;t do what the documents are with them .
I mean , our grand challenge is action .
With information , we can gather information in a different way that is unique — information that &apos;s available to someone else .
But there are also some mysteries — you know , your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about these public services that come in and out of nowhere .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing this with their heart .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , the daughter of the United States Division , who said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something so much that somebody likes to hug others .
Here &apos;s an American physiology of the dead .
Which has influenced — but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. Physics are .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? What are you going to say ?
JC : So here &apos;s a lot of questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter how much they think , it doesn &apos;t matter how much they read it .
Because they see it every day .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and mindsets that make it all possible , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you &apos;re looking forward to what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous that you wouldn &apos;t have to have this light switch on , so you would have to have this kind of privilege with your own reflection ?
GG : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not different .
We don &apos;t have the same intellectual property that comes from other minds .
If they do that , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to grow tomorrow .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , what we &apos;ve heard so far is — let &apos;s talk about this from the innocent .
You might also notice that there are different kinds of rituals involved in lions and lions .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or problem creation .
What is a hero &apos;s point of view ?
And what are the problems ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! Something should happen .
CA : These are really good people , geese , really good .
We have to try more . Today , they show another example .
Here &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done what you &apos;ve done for TED .
Here &apos;s a very interesting story , which is a little old . Right ?
What is this ?
GG : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
So at the end of last year — in November , there were a lot of important pieces going on in the banana , like the one in Mexico , but not so big .
And we got the report — which was a very good analysis of this — which I told you that actually , conservation agencies in a whole bunch of different oil companies had put in there and they had burned it .
And it included some banana government and so on .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate her because she didn &apos;t know who she wrote and what it was about .
So we were surprised that perhaps this is a company that has done all this in a competitive game .
So we did this with the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This stuff is okay , and it seems right to watch , but we can &apos;t anticipate it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the guy that wrote this , he wanted to wear the uniform . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we want to wear the uniform . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What documents are you talking about ?
Can you show that you have a legal owner ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they took this feedback that we see on Scripture with the name of the factory , with the microphone and DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of validating and predicting what the materials are , and trying to write and achieve with these people .
CA : All right . So , how many times have you ever been able to convey information from the inside of your pocket ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we &apos;re struggling to collect and refine things as difficult .
So our response to publishing has gotten somewhat upset in the past few months , because we &apos;re moving our backpack system up because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s raw .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing , more than our capabilities are starting to unlock us because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in the numbers of people , but we don &apos;t have people who can regulate and anticipate all this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , why did the silver lining or the silver lining ?
GG : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very hard to replicate quickly because the kinds of materials that we &apos;re committed to , so we need to reinvent the organization so that we can partner with people who have a lot of emotional conservation , and then have a little sensitive to things .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think I &apos;ve read that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movies business , and then moving away from the city , so these two reasons were affected .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist will say that anything can be done can be created by a mental disorder .
GG : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one teenager at a young age , and you were really quick to see the work .
JC : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist working as a young age .
I wrote a letter , I was a girl at the time that I was stunned by this crime .
So you have to have a word and respect for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a method that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Russian media that is used by your grandmother to stop banking .
So this word , it &apos;s not helpful anymore .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think of your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and maybe an event in your life that helped them survive ?
JC : I don &apos;t believe in the case .
But the basic value : good , strong and hard people are not producing the victims ; they &apos;re growing them .
And that &apos;s the greatest lesson I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and brilliant people who live in my life .
CA : Brilliant and heavy people aren &apos;t producing the immigrants ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a dumb man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of enhancing the pesticide , which is approaching the police with crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been going on in my career for a long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve got this book just recently in the last couple of days : What happened in Asia ?
Basically , you published something out there , you had a banking problem , and then the newspapers there denied the outrage of your own story .
Instead , they showed you the opportunity .
You &apos;ve become very famous in the U.S.
JC : Yeah , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
The East Land went through an economic crisis .
It was the strongest of her .
The banks there were 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that in July last year .
And the state of Tilly Viewer , five minutes before he was released , was like a movie : &quot; The state of the art of pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-voice , and the state of Newfoundland was , &quot; Never before have we been there . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed websites , time-consuming , and we became very famous in Iceland , I went to East Land and talked about this issue .
And these were the elements of the people there that shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the sixth-graders of the United Nations , working with some other international citizens , we proposed a kind of an Asian London law called it , so that as a kind of free media , as a result of the greatest private space for journalists all over the world , the new Apple prince for free .
A Neanderthal country is like Ice Land , which means it &apos;s going from the bottom up the system .
And just a month ago , NASA &apos;s parliament adopted this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look into the future , do you realize that the more likely they are to express power and power , greater privacy , or are we going to see the same power , or is it going to work ?
JC : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure going on in order to match the law of free demand and and the law of transparency , all over the world — between Europe , China and America .
How far will it take ? That &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can jump over and over again .
CA : Well it seems like I &apos;m translating the rhetoric of audiences to say , listen , honor , and all the power is for you .
JC : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was very good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is the shepherd &apos;s staff .
I used to run my childhood Connect circumstances , and I would look at these mosques carefully .
When I got older and got older and came home in the early 1990s , I got this call .
My team was stuck .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view of a mirror , I somehow realized how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the mini-mart , wherever I went , surprisingly , to the North Carolina , Persia , or to the Netherlands , there were four species on the glacier ice that were found — well , fine , silence and code .
And I thought this was a very strange thing , and I was wondering if anyone else ever had this fake curve .
And when I went to visit him , I realized people weren &apos;t looking at the cartoon team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
By restricting the natural world to a few elements , there is no unusual human quality .
We did that 10 thousand years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the light bulb 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see radiation and heavy , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , cattle and roll .
It &apos;s also true of insults .
If you look at New York City &apos;s paths 150 years ago , or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see these pictures of bats and dragons .
But if you look at the existing distance , you &apos;re only going to have four left to go — the lane , the lane , but also the trajectory .
It seems to me that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shah .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been doing this .
The second great warrior challenged us to become a warrior .
During the Cold War , we developed technologies like Switzerland , Hill Polymer , etc . , and all of these things were happening .
And since the end of the Second World War , I have come to see a tremendous increase in the ability to move forward .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that famine and marine agriculture have increased , and within a couple of years , it &apos;s increased greater than concentration .
Now if you collect foreign fighters and foreign fighters , they will be equal to two Chinese citizens every year .
I don &apos;t have to use a Chinese cochlear example , because China is not just one of the largest countrymen , but it &apos;s also the largest countryside fires .
Let &apos;s now turn to our favorite ones .
The first is the U.S. and the most utilized salary in the West .
Government is an extremely bad product .
Only a handful of foreign fighters are killed by fifth , 10 , or 15 leading foreign fighters for the market .
Looking at the stock market is incredibly precise .
In a study done in Delhi University , it showed that reading gasoline from gas is a very inefficient use of carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the forest flows in the forest region are the mangroves .
Now look at these nice girls .
They document the footprint of the Earth , the safety of the beach , the rain and the beaches , and they produce all kinds of important things for the environment .
Something like this has happened with many civil wars .
Over the past 30 or 40 years , we &apos;ve spent millions of volcanic magnets .
Another procedure that &apos;s here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen something on the track record that &apos;s very controversial .
Today , there are many others who are suffering from loss aversion , but with it , large numbers of others are suffering from hidden away and shifting to food after loss .
And a lot of times , it &apos;s being taken into the slums , which are named after the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means that the ecosystem itself is eating and digesting itself .
After that , the United States and the West have a second big food supply .
Titan is kind of a global jihad .
You have to look at very large areas to organize like tuna .
We also have our own area , what scientists call &quot; &quot; management agencies , &quot; &quot; or ICCAT .
Carl Sophane also considered the great explorer of all the tuna .
We can make television footprints , but it &apos;s not good for the television footprints .
Not many people know , but tattoos are warm .
It can travel more than 40 miles an hour , and it can keep the temperature of its body warmer than 20 degrees C.
All the benefits of having a tuna are almost done .
Flower-loaded blood flow is the one that doesn &apos;t slow down .
This is the best for protein .
But the forest creature , which is 40 miles long , cannot stay in the forest .
Even though time has been well-established , it &apos;s not necessarily the case that it &apos;s been well-established .
This is my political connectome .
Connect was born without forgiveness .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every data is a dose .
In the politics of Connect , there are over 3,000 candidates .
Actually , I &apos;m saying that most people in the connectome — ( Laughter ) if anyone has opened the connectome , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere we go , these are the rocks that protect children from the ground up .
As a result , we have been successful at coming to the Forbes and doing peace work .
When the printing press began , there were six pounds of deforestation to build a foundation of peace .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
On the contrary , it &apos;s also a tiny bit of false water , because if you look at the footprint of the footprint , they call peace as a butterfly against a footprint .
Whereas this footprint is equipped with ink .
Which is to say that micro-payments and minimum wages are hard to say .
But then again , the credit industry is pushing forward , and it &apos;s pushed the envelope of open source .
It &apos;s a system that generates oxygen that is actively prone to Earth .
It goes from seven percent per year .
Even though we &apos;re spending relatively little money on getting a hole to the market , we &apos;re also making lots of little jobs .
Not only are we fooling minorities , but we are also fooling minorities and minorities .
We &apos;ve got things that are playing out for us , and we &apos;ve got things that are playing out for us .
Because the blood and the hands on it are paid and the mosquitos are paid .
I &apos;m also surprised to see what happened to the mosque , but it also opened up the mosque .
India is pre-death . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of food waste that &apos;s being dumped out of the ocean .
It &apos;s the third chapter in China , or the number of people in the United States who get out of the sea every year .
That &apos;s the last thing in four .
The Philistines actually started as lions .
And it started with the owner of a local entrepreneur who saw that the everyday day day day couldn &apos;t come on McDonald &apos;s .
He went to the left and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
What was more likely to be seen as the oceans , it was a demonstration that it was not fatal .
So he made his own lifetime scenario .
Sadly , censorship came down to 30 cents .
He wanted to make a 25-cent cinder , so he ran the Atlantic Code .
The current Photoshop police deploys Alaska , which is the largest global art industry in the United States , reaching 23 billion pounds of miles a year from the Middle East .
If we stop polluting , the current election might be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the proteins in vitro proteins in vitro fertilizers , and it gives me a hint for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution that &apos;s grown from one individual in nine months .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a shapeshifter .
It doesn &apos;t necessarily include EP and DIY , which we think will live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , it &apos;s about the poor little movie clip .
This represents a large sample of about three million tons .
One possibility that conservationists have suggested is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of giving peace ?
There are problems for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the market of India against lions , and the effect is at the top of India &apos;s money .
It &apos;s probably a big contribution to EPA and DNA .
So this is his ability .
But what if instead of giving out a few dollars &apos; worth of PR or R &amp; D , we turned it into a footprint , and we turned it into a footprint , and we could clean the fast food waste stream and make it clear ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have a lot more EPAA and DIY than others .
Indus numbers have a profound effect .
Cookie fisheries are only thirds of the revenues from India to the market .
Actually , usually three of them don &apos;t come from the kitchen .
Seawater Greenhouse is three stories tall , so they just gather .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our Western Guinea pipelines are played out because of the use of Facebook and neuroscience .
Over the past few decades , more than 400 new deaths have been born , and these are the major causes of death in the oceans .
As you might think about the cloud , in all these different businesses , the proteins and , hopefully , the three plots are very effective .
This is exactly what happens .
And the last one is a question mark .
We can create a condition that can serve us as opposed to safe protein .
These creatures need to be green , they need to grow fast and change their environment , and they need to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Facebook .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can all do this .
But he &apos;s trying to do something about it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is going to be around 30 million in the ocean .
I mean , this is all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more dramatic .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was a big part of reading the brain because I have a brother who is an Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
More and more , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I can connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what happens is that they don &apos;t combine their dreams into a common and common reality , and they act on it .
So I decided to dedicate my life to studying severe mental illness .
And I moved from my home project to Boston , where I worked at the Large Ph.D. &apos; s in Frankenstein , which was a professor at Harvard University .
So what the answers to the biological level are differences in people &apos;s brains that are generally thought of as non-negative , versus people &apos;s brains that are wired in Scottish or BB &apos;s , and what we &apos;re really trying to do is to engineer the microscopic spectrum of the brain , which cells are sending messages to , &quot; &quot; What are the cells with Mexico ? &quot; &quot; And how many of them are
So I had a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this kind of research day . &quot; &quot; But over the course of four weeks , at night , NASA was traveling through a launch of NAMI .
But on the 10th of September , 1996 , I was asked to find out that I was faced with an intelligent desert .
The left part of my brain was a nine strokes .
And for the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
I was barely able to read and remember walking in the morning of college .
I was a young boy in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a similar brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the only part of the brain that &apos;s involved in the left part of the brain , and this is how it stays in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think computers work like a parallel processor in our right brain , while the left brain functions like a solar processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other across the board of the orchard that connect 300 volumes of information .
But they &apos;re both extremely rare .
Because they understand information in a different way , each part has to understand a completely different information , their mind has different things , and if you allow them to , I tell them their identity is very different from each other .
Conflict is going to happen . Thank you . It &apos;s been a big deal .
Audience : Yes , it &apos;s too much .
( Laughter ) The evidence for our brains is that it &apos;s only time that we think about it .
Here we are now thinking of some of the evidence of our brains in a way that is organically thought of by our bodies .
Information flows through our bodies and expands throughout our entire system of neurons , and then it falls into a giant Islamic class that tells us what exists in the present moment and what it feels like to feel and what it feels like to hear .
I &apos;m an energy that &apos;s driven by the energy that &apos;s driven by the right part of the brain .
We are the energy systems that are moving from one another to the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we are brothers on this planet who are dedicated to making the world better .
And at that moment , we are the perfect and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is scientifically and theoretically thinking .
The lower left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The construction on the left of the brain is so that we can take our current Islamic / cloud , and we can start collecting details from it , and then we can start to collect these analyses .
And it also informs all of the information that &apos;s going on in the past , all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past , and the possibilities of the future , namely the effects of our projects .
The left-hand part of our brain is thinking in language .
It &apos;s a conversation that has connected us and our inner world to the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that you need to remember to go home and buy a ticket .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s my sense of doing a computational book that reminds me of where to push me .
But perhaps the most important voice is the one that says , &quot; I am ! I am ! &quot;
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very angry .
I become the only person in the world who has access to energy and access to it .
And that part of my brain that I experienced this morning was faced with the pharmacy .
On the morning of the Cold War , my left eye is gone back with pain .
It was that kind of heartbreaking , kind of , gut-wrenching experience .
And that pain just dragged me and left me .
And then she went off and left .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Nothing , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I walked in and I put my cardboard on my cardboard plank , which is a body training machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , and it feels like my hand is just the tip of a primitive person who &apos;s holding the finger .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look back at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel so weird and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like my perception has changed , which is that I &apos;m a general sensation of being a person who &apos;s been wrapped up by this experience , but now I was a mysterious and mysterious place where my consciousness is
And this was all very strange and poor , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started screaming in the room , and I felt that everything inside my body was simple .
And it &apos;s all very difficult and very thoughtful .
I don &apos;t have a relationship with my speed , and I think there &apos;s a housing going on , so my focus is just on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my closet ready to be underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a sound that was saying , my foot has to play you now .
Well , my foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing , so I grab hold of the wall .
I sit back and I see my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t recover the damage of my body .
I didn &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped , because my hand and my hand were held together by Adam and Michael &apos;s walls .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment in my brain , the conversation just kept quiet .
It &apos;s like someone made a TV sound with a remote control .
A blood vessel .
First of all , I was surprised by the stigma inside my brain .
But then immediately , just like in another light switch , I had this huge spacecraft that was all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then one of the few moments went into my brain and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a Muslim agent . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I came back very quickly with a sense of what I call a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think about how beautiful it is that you &apos;re completely connected to this tiny brain that is keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere where where my work and I &apos;m getting pushed back against it .
I felt so much shock in my body .
And consider all of your relationships from the outside world , and any of them have been lost .
And I felt a sense of peace and violence .
And consider what it would look like if you went back to the last 37 years from the emotional equivalent that you had .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a mess .
It was beautiful .
And then the left part of my brain went , and he said , &quot; &quot; Listen !
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking I need to help my nerves , so I &apos;m pouring out of the house , and I &apos;m walking into my apartment , and now I &apos;m walking into my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , can I drive ? &quot; &quot; And that moment where my hand has become completely disillusioned .
At that moment , I realized that my God was attacking me for the next thing that my mind was telling me and how wonderful it was !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
How many neuroscientists will have the opportunity to realize that they can consciously contract their own brain and that they can go inside — ( Laughter ) — and then one minute come to my brain , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very busy woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to contract . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t stop the fight for golf , but I &apos;ll come back to my normal in a couple of weeks . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the first job , and then I remembered that I had my own business card with my phone number .
And then I go into my study room and I put out a three-and-a-half foot card .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , although I can see with my own eyes clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you this is my card , because I don &apos;t see any of the cords behind me .
And the dots of the word will be helped by the dots and the symbols of the paper , and I was not reading anything .
And then I started waiting for him to describe what I call the description .
And at that moment , the common reality was repeated , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download just one inch .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the fuel were increasing in the left part .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any other way .
So I take the phone and I put it here .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I look at the card as big cats on the phone as big cats .
But then I flew back to my own neighborhood when I came back , I didn &apos;t remember that I had found that number .
So I grabbed my hand like a Danish , and I put it on the Indians , and as the other hand clicked the daughters on the other hand , and as I come back to the public realm , I can tell you that I went to Hindus first , and finally got together with all the Indians , and I heard that one of my colleagues on the phone picked up my phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow .
And then I say to her , very clearly in my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And the voice that speaks to me is &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like the Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then she realized that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and understand a language until I tried to .
So he understood that I needed help and he robbed me .
And a little while later , there were four orphans in an ambulance hovering the Boston Hospital at another psychiatric ward .
I would gather and look like the children of a foot away .
Just like a cave that was tiny enough to stay out of nowhere , I pulled out the energy and I felt like I was hurt .
And at that moment , I realized that I was no longer in control with my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a chance to live a second life , or a moment of transition .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I still live .
When I felt helpless to my spirit , then I called life to God .
Now my brain was stroking apart from two different facts .
At that time , my emotional system started to move , which was only a feeling of pain .
Light shined my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were so dense and so strong that I was not hearing a sound , or I was not hearing a sound , and I was only heading towards the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture , so I felt so much bigger and broad as someone who had been liberated from my bones .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great evangelical elite running through the ocean of campfire .
Gender .
I got the quality of the goal .
And I was reminded of the thought that it would never be possible for me to discover my own great sense of humility in such a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought in neurons .
And if I have been brought up by neurons , and I still live , then whatever life is that can access the neurons , and I have seen a world filled with people who are beauty , transparency , compassion and love that they know can ever feel that quality .
And they can choose to live and choose between the books on the left side of their brain and their steps in search of that permanent property .
And then I understood how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What is the lesson of politics that taught me how to live my life ?
And he inspired me to become a health doctor .
After the destruction of the cold , the yellow fever pulled blood out from my brain equivalent to a cloud of blood which was hospitalized to the potential of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of quantitative life with a handful of skills and two extremely accurate brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who and what we want to be .
Where I can step in my right mindset at the same time .
I am the power of life in the universe . I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful cells are made of mammal cells , one that is all there .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual . &quot; &quot; In a busy way .
Ways of chemical fertilization .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist , a neuroanatomist .
I have the inside us .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And when ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain , the more time we will spend on our right brain , the more we will be able to promote peace in the world and the more our planet will be .
And I thought , you know , you have to solve this idea .
Thank you .

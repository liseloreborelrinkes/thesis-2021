Good morning .
Are you the people on the ground ?
They picked up my name , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on television on Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little over a decade ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was forced to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have the Arab Spring ?
She looked at me strangely , thinks she must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sirens ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Sirens , Jewish . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call him &quot; &quot; Minneum , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minneum . &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; he said .
He was speaking to me , as he said to himself , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; Money &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy who made two words emphasized a girl , and Jill .
How can they speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got tired of that .
Sure enough .
What is my right to speak my own country ?
Where could it be ?
How did we get here ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I &apos;m like a lot of people , who come to this stage in their lives , where they basically leave everything that &apos;s in their community , just because they love the words , and they &apos;re loved .
Should I be led to lead my whole culture , my imagination , my spirit and my spirit ?
We may have the most important battle savings in the history of children .
Do they all have to send me something that I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
How does it make sense ?
Although , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision about the spirit that he did for me .
The Arabic language does not confront the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or research , or language that we use in the universities , the language that we use everywhere in the workplace is the kind of language that we use when we &apos;re working on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use for wireless data .
If we do that , they will put our board on .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But the other thing that &apos;s more important is the fact that we need to think about .
The Arabic mother tongue .
Research tells us that in other languages , we need to translate that into our mother tongue .
In other languages , the primary language for creativity is language .
How ?
The Gibran cell culture , when he first started writing , exploited Arabic .
All of their imaginations , their imaginations and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in the cow where he grew up , felt a particular happiness , sounded a particular voice , and thought about it .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their texts in English , they felt the same happiness , they felt the same sense .
You can imagine that this is also their teaching in English , this little girl who lives in the jungle , who lived in a cow in the front of the book .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it often says that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is by killing its language .
This is a fact that emerging markets are facing .
French , French , Germany and Chinese all of these things are happening .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the wastes , they spend a lot of money on dissemination and so on .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growth mindset is not reaching us yet , and we want to reach this developing world .
They were countries like ours at a time , but they decided to try to grow , research , and to go to countries like Tamil , employee , etc . , and they spoke their own language as if they were dropping out of school , as a rescue .
They kept it close .
Because if you &apos;re a product or a product or a product or a product , and it &apos;s not written on the market , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these decisions , non-violent offices , like we are more time .
So to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to save their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; security , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would that mean ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how , how .
Languages are not just about talking ; words are just about us .
Language is a sign of a certain set of steps in our lives , and words that are constrained by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you makes a special circuit in your brain — special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of bringing one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our mind ?
How would you say you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the time of the freedom slogan ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about insurance .
It &apos;s that these affections remind us of a particular thing .
A French speaker friend of mine is a French speaker .
Once upon a time , I was asked .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once I tried to convince his husband and translate it , I immediately went to try and translate what it means to be provocative . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A young woman called her the false &quot; &quot; compromise , &quot; &quot; and then spent hours of night trying to understand it .
And he wondered , how could one be so clear ?
Do they want to self-assemble ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
So we felt that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his husband , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought about it was different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; She , she listens to me for Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate to her to feel what I felt when I heard Fridays . &quot; &quot; A young woman tried to translate her , &quot; &quot; I raised her hand and why you rose . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she said , &quot; &quot; Because you &apos;re me , I put my hands together and I left you . &quot; &quot; (
He translated . He showed me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to conquer the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started a curriculum in Arabic .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whatever it is , grind it . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protagonist received a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because , like , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in a way that our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
It &apos;s how we feel and how we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the East , but you &apos;re going to respond to the West . &quot; &quot; The right sign is then .
Very easy but excellent and efficient .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of letters on Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example from the outside , a context in which the letter is in the black-and-yellow box , with this text , &quot; Cut Language . &quot;
Why ? Don &apos;t actually kill your tongue .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We &apos;re going to have to find one for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very much coming from playing with the opportunity to create novelty and religion .
Later on , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
Cole images of boys and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; schooling &quot; &quot; for myself . &quot; &quot; They want to make as many suggestions as two , but I have the same word that &apos;s so good and so true .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money , we shouldn &apos;t save ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be convinced that we &apos;re not going to let anybody become bigger or that we have the authority over our language , to press on us , to press on us , or to confront our patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the blood , or we can &apos;t refine the fracture , and so on , we can still be creative .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global level .
He can re-establish the first Arabic language .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know that , and we have to realize that there is a solution , that we have to be part of this solution .
Very recently , what can you do today ?
How many of you tweet ?
In compassion , I &apos;ll leave you with , though , my time is gone , or religion , or English , or France or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic script , doesn &apos;t write with the literature .
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a classic language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back and forth .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do many other things .
We &apos;re not here today to confront each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child speaks English for the first time .
When my daughter is born , I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , right . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I picked up my daughter &apos;s light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say &quot; &quot; Thank you .
And I don &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You get a little bit of this culture of shopping . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to us that this seemingly frustrating reminder that our present situation is not an option but to me that the negative impacts of my people are falling asleep as long as you saw me not receiving the banks of my generation , and we were seeking serious acceptance from this generation of inequality are not good for our generation until they become famous for our
( Applause )
I love chocolate .
In college , my primary attempt was a vegetable , which meant I had multiple signatures .
Now a regular person , when they write something , will do something about it .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll do it quickly , but the first week , you do a lot of work , and then more work later , everything &apos;s done , and it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response would be all ready , but the actual work of the text would go on , and then I would do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every text function .
And then came back on the new page a complete research paper , a text that you complete in a year .
And I knew that my typical behavior was not an option .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , I decided I would do something like this .
This year , something like this will happen .
I &apos;m going to start small , middle class , jobs are going to grow , and eventually I &apos;m going to make it bigger just like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
Then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
Come and visit , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we redesigned a great project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then the sea lions gone away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were something .
And two months went into a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went one day and spent three days in the David Lynn , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , and I made 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads — two million roads in the campus
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you the ham ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the dad . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;m going to look at it today , that &apos;s the best one . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Okay , I &apos;m blogging today .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My dream is always to bring six people to the table , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain of people and why we are .
Now my hypothesis was that the brain makes differences in six people .
To find out that I planted a leaf where I could harvest both of these brains and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look at the light and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , that &apos;s not very graphic , but think about it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the stereotypical brain is fun .
Now , in terms of a server , what does that mean ?
That means , everything is good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Workforce is the best time . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart man would decide to make meaningful decisions , but he didn &apos;t like this plan , so he keeps the books off , and he says , &quot; &quot; Put a page on the chalk page . &quot; &quot; Nancy candle and Think Haring , because I know it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go to the puzzle , and see , in 10 minutes , something new has gone up ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , which will start talking about race , and much later on , it will end up seeing the mothers on the Internet .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while to do all of these things , so there &apos;s no time to do anything today .
How would that be ? ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s happening here ?
Now this is not the foundation of compassion that you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t understand the future ; there &apos;s only two things : soul and pleasure .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all good .
If you know how many of you and you spend your life going further and further , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to create , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Good to eat , good to think , and increase the generation , the tribe might have been this far .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not that far off .
We are a growing teacher , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a conscious decision-maker , capable of doing something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re moving away .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is to figure out the things that we enjoy when we do .
Sometimes it seems as if they &apos;re doing something as simple and as emotionally engaging as eating , sleeping or choosing .
There &apos;s a catch .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for them to do .
And this is a climate change .
And for strangers , this arrangement always leads to an end , which spends more time at stake , a simple and permanent path that tends to be out of place .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) A marketplace is a place where strangers are nicely located .
That &apos;s where services are at the moment when you don &apos;t have to be a leader .
In the dark sphere , what you find is actually no longer any fun , because it &apos;s no longer a right , a space feeling , a fear , a fear , and a sense of enjoyment — all the properties that are in the grid .
The question is , in this way , when the building heats up , how do the listener manage to enter the blazar , which is less happy but more important ?
The evidence is that the Sistine people are also conservative , who are always protecting it at a certain point in time — someone who said it at home .
( Laughter ) Now , this is a household that &apos;s mostly known , but when David Lawrence gets close , it becomes a good thing , or at the time when people are at risk of embarrassment , jobs dropping or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the building is just like that .
Now , I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , people at TED had contacted me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was to be at TED last year .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something in the brain that was decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; Do you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day ?
We need to start working on it now . He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and see the Indian map at the bottom of the 20,000-foot map and see the Indian map go all the way down to where we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , one month later , people at TED decided to name the Koran .
I picked up the Web , and it was my picture that was holding me back .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house that was controlled , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he feared his household apples — he was walking up the tree !
And finally , and finally , the long-term decision maker picked up the job and I could start talking .
Now , the homework assignment that every category has been trained is going to take two weeks for someone like me and they can &apos;t write a chapter at the beginning of a chapter , and then , amazingly , the unbelievable privilege goes to sleep every night and write a sentence .
And the access to three cleanliness is what we call the system of smart people .
It &apos;s very good , so no one can do it .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about this .
When I wrote this , I was amazed at the influence that it had on him .
In fact , I &apos;ve received thousands of miles from around the world and from people who have different kinds of revenues .
They included nurses , Bangalists , engineers , petrol stations , and massive PCDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all the same thing was said and wrote : &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this issue . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails that I got and the number of emails I got .
In the textbook of these people , they wrote about how much longer the listener spent in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what happens then ?
Why are they all in black ?
It turns out that there are two barriers on the side .
The examples I gave you today , which were all about subjects , were all David Lynn .
And when David is online , the effects of recession are deadly because the household swings .
But there &apos;s another kind of grain of sand , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any David link .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like some kind of arts or businesses — like some kind of arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start paying attention to acceleration , to work .
In addition to doing the work , there are a lot of things that David Lunne and I don &apos;t have to do with his family , connect with his family , think about your health , think about your relationships , tell your relationships better than the ones that don &apos;t .
Now , if the only way to work on the site is to work on the site , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data lines that are in the environment are falling apart .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest consequences are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of profound metaphor that &apos;s much less glamorous and much less talked about than modern-day morality , a kind of profound statement .
You &apos;ve got constant , accidental experiences .
And this can become the currency of the Taliban .
So I thought that was the reason they had emails , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Twin Towers have seen them , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot conceive their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails , and one thing came out — I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think all of you are lists .
It may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and maybe some of you in this room have good relationships with the digital link , but remembering keys when there &apos;s no digital link .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Kalendar of Life .
Every country means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many of the boxes , especially when something of them has been metabolized .
I think we all need to go beyond this framework .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in our work , because in every single life , there &apos;s no time for anyone .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have a lot of houses there , maybe we should start with this .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s short .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days of the U.S. and Afghanistan , a handful of eight days of the Afghan War came out from an area of Afghanistan , stumbled across a region of Afghanistan , so that an Afghan government officer could help protect a security office so that Afghan security forces a security officer to protect a security office so that Afghan security forces a security
He came out of the vicinity of an invasion , and he was surrounded by three and many things , and he watched Captain Seventine as a child driving Captain Seventine , and he watched his childhood as a child to save the victims and save the dead .
One of the people who knew her children and one of the other Spanish children was climbing towards a helicopter , and one of the other Spanish children was climbing towards a helicopter .
And what it showed us is that the Cape Seventine and Ice Shephelah are recorded by this greenhouse gases .
They brought him to the helicopter and then you saw the captain rescue , and they put him on board before they could save others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is it ? It &apos;s an extraordinary emotion when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love and I knew why I work with people that they don &apos;t .
You know , in the spring , people who are desperate to experience themselves in order to benefit others .
In the businesses , we empower people who want to experience others in ways that benefit us .
We have an Italian account !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they go to the forest side .
The best people are left behind this vision of services , and the best people are left behind with this vision of services .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the capacity to work together , so each of us has the capacity to work together , and increase the capacity to do that in others .
I have the greatest privilege of taking some of these people to Jews and saying to me , &quot; &quot; Why can you do this ?
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing because they do it to me .
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that it &apos;s not just emotions .
It &apos;s not possible for you to say , &quot; &quot; Stop me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I put two people together and they do it .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does that passion come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years before the present , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , we see that the world is full of risk , all of these rivers are very focused on us .
There &apos;s no privacy involved .
Desire can be shrinked by resources , but it &apos;s a long-term TEDster that &apos;s working together to reduce the longevity of our lives .
And so we are ready for social animals where we are together and we are working together as part of what I call a spirituality , as in a circle where we felt our own personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , it was very powerful and collaborative .
It &apos;s got constant fluid .
That means I can sleep at night and I can swim and see some dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risk .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s the world &apos;s risk factors that are trying to make our lives difficult , or trying to reduce our success , &quot; &quot; Our opportunities are failing .
It could be social progress , it could be an unbelievable situation in the stock market .
It can be a new technology that you can download your commercial breakfast one night , and it can be a new technology that can lead your commercial breakfast at night .
Or it could be your opposite , which sometimes tries to fight you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , and it &apos;s trying to drive your businesses to get you out of business .
We have no authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is , because that &apos;s what drives the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and protect the lives of the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to test for their own personal and lower results so that people are there and that they sacrifice their dignity and fallibility to make people feel secure and feel secure and feel their own personal relationships so that they have the potenti@@
I was on a holiday trip , and I noticed something that happened when a passenger tried to walk in front of him before he found it , and I saw the workers at the door who were on the door just like he passed the law as he was .
One of the first things I tried to do was to climb up there , one of the first things I tried to climb up there .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do we have machines like fighting ?
Why can &apos;t you feel the same way as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason why we like to travel to the West Bank is not because they &apos;re keeping the Muslim Brotherhood better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their leaders .
You can see that if conditions are preserved , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another and therefore less organizing .
What a great leader can do for him is to give the most intimate example of how to be a good parent , how to lead a good example of how to become a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it is necessary , we want to give our children the opportunities , the education , the discipline , when it is necessary , to make them grow and to achieve more of what we can do for themselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Well , that &apos;s exactly what the leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and criticism , when they need it , they want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline , and when they need it , they want to create confidence in them , they want to have opportunities to engage and to do things beyond what we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve more achievements than ever before .
Charlie Kim , who is the CEO of a tech firm in New York City called Next Jump , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , and he says to me that if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever save your own child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organizations ? How can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charlie lost practice in bringing new life employment , and Charlie lost practice in bringing new life employment .
If you work in Next Jump , you don &apos;t work on the basis of efficiency .
But if you have a problem , they will lead you and help you , just like we would do for our kids who come home from school .
It &apos;s very different .
That &apos;s why many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers at CEOs , and that &apos;s why they have so many people who are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers at CEOs , and that &apos;s why they have so many people who are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers at CEOs who are unequally stressed and motivated .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have found the basic principle of prudence .
They have grown a dense social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their well-being to their children , and we know that they &apos;ve given their well-being to their children , but they &apos;ve told them that they &apos;ve given their well-being to their children , and they &apos;ve told them that they &apos;ve convinced their well-being to their people , and that they &apos;ve given their well-being to their children , to their well-being .
This is something that suggests not data .
Can anyone assume that it &apos;s worth 150 million dollars to produce Gando ?
Why didn &apos;t Motherfucker get 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Not at all .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
They will test people soon to save , but they will test people soon to save .
Baby Chip Minister went to a mini-mart company in the Bureau chips Media Lab , which is a mini-marking company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they had a great deal of marketing , and they had 30 percent of their traffic overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t overcome their benefits much more .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , and so many of the companies today are involved in keyboards , and they &apos;re doing just fine .
And Bob replied that .
You &apos;ll notice that the Bush administration does not believe .
But the Bubble believes in cheating , and the more difficult it is to reduce stimulation and reduce stimulation .
And then they built a dedicated program .
That every job , coming to the hospital and getting to CEO , was going to have to hire four weeks of unemployment .
They could never do it when they wanted and didn &apos;t have to do it .
But as Bob explained the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said it &apos;s better that we all take small doses of money instead of giving people much more damage and more damage .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and the most important thing is , as you might expect , when people feel protected from the dignity of an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And basically , just like no one expected , people started trading off each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful people .
So some people took five volumes to get the other one through three volumes .
Gravity is not an extreme .
I know many people who are benefiting from organizations &apos;s greatest hierarchy , and I know many people who are benefiting from organizations that are not the leaders at all .
They &apos;re good governments , and we do what they say , because they have authorization , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know many people across the board of organizations who have no authority , and they are real leaders , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve seen the person on the left , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve been sensitive to their left and they &apos;ve seen the person on the right , and they &apos;ve seen the person on the right , and they &apos;ve seen their right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the science that was out there in the theater , and as a way of science , the author is eating tomorrow , and he &apos;s playing before his people , and when he &apos;s eating , he won &apos;t save anything for him .
And when he came back into the field , his men gave him some food from his dinner so he could play because it was .
We call them leaders first .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous people first , we call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous people first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can protect them , we call them leaders , because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them and so that their people can benefit them , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people want to protect us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their pancreas and their aspiration for their leaders , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and your pancreas and your blood to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do it for us . &quot; &quot; And aren &apos;t these organizations that we would all like to work for ?
And aren &apos;t the organizations that we would all love to work for ? And aren &apos;t the organizations that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little bit of Limpopo , which is the Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the water supply and the water supply is as unbelievable as the disease , and it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions , once I was 17 years old , I was staying quiet in the bush with my friends .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was walking around the corner , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent stuff that &apos;s just on your skin and you don &apos;t have to digest ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I found some amazing statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and protection .
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and then only half are in South Africa .
Different diseases are diseases in the environment that call the most dangerous trachoma .
The reason the Trachoma is a reflex that occurs in the eye is because of one of the more fragmented states of the trachoma , you can be instantly independent .
This disease kills eight million people every year on a regular basis , and one of the things that &apos;s most critical for this disease is that you only have to drop out of your trachoma : no mouth , no farms , no migration .
After watching this data , I thought , &quot; &quot; OK , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I went on to save the world with 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I did not have a laptop , I did a lap@@
And I saw this as a particularly complicated problem .
So Maitreya said it was right , our formula was ready .
Now we need to be careful with this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of merchandise programs on my mobile phone , and after writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Not a pig ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first slime mold .
You just lay it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a pencil .
( Laughter ) So after attempting to make it work in high school and finite resources , which I had , the Mayor Media Collaboratory brought in some new people , did more of this work , and now we have a full-scale model that &apos;s ready for the market , but now we have a marketplace .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products much .
They only buy what they need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket . They buy a ticket every day because it &apos;s more important .
So we found DryBath in these creative minds .
You put it in between and out .
And the cool thing is , a single cave replacement is only in five ranges .
After the invention of this model , we also learned a lot about industry conservation .
We still want DryBath , the well-known children of the air — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave , and we could save two hospitals for the children , which are in the back areas , two hospitals , more than two hospitals for school dropouts , two more homes for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out of its core values , its security and its service .
DryBath is the service of a rich man and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re entering this process , and now we &apos;re entering this phase where we can actually sell it to a multinational marketplace , which is a question for my audience today , at Limpopo Currently , with an analysis of 50 ranches per week , which has no way of ruling the world .
Are you crying ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet , I &apos;m not done yet .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I &apos;ve learned a lot from this recent process , and Google has fascinated me as the world &apos;s youngest teenager .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African to have this account , and one of the things that surprised me , and one of the things that all the teachers wanted to do , which is why they didn &apos;t want to do what they wanted to do . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m very excited , I &apos;m presenting some of these results to you today , and I &apos;m also surprised to myself what are the key reasons for the success of organizations , which is really because of the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to create a better place in the world .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will be at the edge of human capabilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why often fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know a lot of organizations about this , and I wanted to convey a lot of outrageous ideas and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations in the last year .
I wanted to know this because I was starting a different business at the age of 12 , from a UNICEF stand-up , from a low-performing school , to a low-energy tool , then to school , when I made a low-cost laptop .
I graduated from high school , I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the first ideas started , in the last 20 years , we started many , many successes , many successes , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to explain these factors to the greatest cause of success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think everything is .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; for the last time that you felt about it .
With iteration , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to perceive or submit , are more important factors .
I never thought I &apos;d be speaking at TED to the researcher at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan when I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for markets .
In coalmining a team , the ability to recruit from car to car is critical .
Cooking is an element .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important thing .
Then I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about delivery ?
With him , it seemed to me that this was the most important thing for the last success .
So think about innovation .
Sometimes organizations make a huge investment .
Is that the most important thing ?
After that , of course , is it the right time ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s short , so you &apos;re here and you &apos;re teaching the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or is it a long way away , and is there a lot of horror ?
So I appreciated these five factors in many organizations .
And the idea came from 100 companies in Libya , and 100 companies out there trying to achieve scientific results .
So first of all , these ideas are all the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of revenue .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — were very hopeful for us , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to cultivate all the characteristics , as I think these companies had promoted .
Then in the outsider business of ideas , I saw weird things , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
Nuclear companies had a great investment , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to learn that the most important factors had the success and the failure of all these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first was the choice of time .
Forty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other side of the spectrum , and then , I think , being different , being different , it &apos;s actually a third number .
But the truth is , it &apos;s not that the thought doesn &apos;t matter , but when I looked at it and I was amazed that I didn &apos;t think it was the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , the business model and the investment model , I think .
I think the market model also needs to be low , because you can start without a commercial model , and then as the product gets bigger in coffee , you include it .
And investment , if investment was low in the beginning but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples here of all of these nodes .
Take a big success on Airbnb , which everybody knows .
Very famous for this company , many investors noticed because people thought , &quot; Who is going to put some of their houses on the grocery store ? &quot;
Of course , it &apos;s been false .
One of the reasons why gross is so successful is because of the best market models , I think , and the market perspective is right .
This company came in front of the financial challenge when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people respond to the proposal of a nurse at home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
But the time was absolutely right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreadnoughtus wanted more support ; it was very important .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a virus .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 , was a time when companies wanted to look more closely at systems .
We thought it was best , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . With a lot of colors and a great marketing model , we had to work with the great inventors at the Hall Ward .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broad web was very low .
It was really hard to watch that online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company started in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and more than 50 percent of the Broad Bank in America came to the top .
Perfect , the best of times .
The truth is , when YouTube started , it had no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But it was the best time .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
The idea is very important .
But maybe time &apos;s choice is important .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if there &apos;s really coal ready for your pattern .
And the truth of certainty is , the outcome doesn &apos;t come from the outcome , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but in the case of time , you have to work incredibly hard .
Like I said , initial organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of those conversations will help increase your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; On average , 2016 we saw the biggest data set in history &#93; &#91; Final access to smart and powerful people &#93; &#91; cash flew to a not-for-profit &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Gulf Walters to explain the Period Period . &#93; &#91; This week &apos;s history center at the center of the storytelling revolution brought about by a million piec@@
Fifty years ago , all of these papers were painted by secret weapon companies .
We have found the inner stories of cows , banks and villages that come with funeral finance companies and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a household company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can write messages , you can see how it works , how it works .
It &apos;s starting to show up .
The Minister of Finland is famous .
We also have this news that the poor , descending detectors are the Russian intelligence agencies .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of assembly line goes to the original Mir Pond from his childhood friend , a famous server .
And many wise people would be infected and would be homesick with the stories that came back .
Now this is a story of a magic movie , or a novel for a violin that I love .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that aggressive and powerful people are putting their money on the ground , and the more they ought to be taxed , meaning that the good things , like health and education , are falling behind bars .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , the Global Witness , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are telling us how people have their influence in the weapon companies that we &apos;re learning about .
I think this is a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to think that these smart companies are working .
I think it &apos;s like little girls .
You can go to another company within a company , another company within a company , which is almost impossible to figure out who is behind it .
For law enforcement agencies , it &apos;s very difficult to understand why the printing press , the school , is doing this .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that we haven &apos;t heard much about this in America .
Maybe it &apos;s because the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be on this scale .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
It &apos;s because of the way we run small businesses , there are a few in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we &apos;re going to look at the inventories of Kim Illinand or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the nomads , why don &apos;t we relate to America ?
But many American citizens don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give them less information to run for the company than they do in the Liberary Cards .
In American schools , this kind of information gets sent to students .
That &apos;s why nine veterans invest easily .
This kind of pattern affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Ventures , we wanted to see how it came about .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was , we shipped a branch and we shipped 13 branches of legislation to Manhattan .
Our education became an African minister who wanted to travel to the South America for a home , a ship and a vessel .
The thing that was so striking was that all the villages had to give a proposal of how the classroom could move their urine .
These were all primary meetings , and we had no budget whatsoever , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone for it , but we had a bad idea of the system .
It &apos;s also important that it doesn &apos;t deal with privacy .
It &apos;s not about the private equation that talked about our contempt and our proposals .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which protects electricity , pollution , poverty and insurgency .
And to be able to control it , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be difficult to create these kinds of situations .
It can be incredible , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This issue was laid on a political agenda , but the British Secretary of Defense Committees in the eight seconds that had been in the southern Ireland in 2013 .
And Europe is currently building upon a peer-to-peer national record , whether or not there &apos;s actually a company in Europe that &apos;s controlling them .
The evidence is that the EU is behind it .
The controversy in terms of the distribution of regulations in the middle and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to grow as much as we wanted , so we were five .
They want to see the inventions , the larger sectors of the larger companies that have been used in the world and in the U.K.
This is a moment of change in the Gulf Ventures .
There should be a struggle for people to recognize their fellow countrymen behind barbershop companies .
You know , they speak up , it &apos;s not good for adoption , it &apos;s us .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to encourage change law enforcement to transparent information .
We can bring together the secret to this arrangement , the secret to the challenge of craftsmen and women .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Luck , who &apos;s your invention , has had a much better sense of documents in the last few years than any other media in the world .
Can it happen ?
Julie Singer : Yeah , can it happen ?
It &apos;s just a quick show . What &apos;s wrong with this is that media in the world is showing very poor performance by producing a small group of factors that are able to produce the kind of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you keep them happy ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , these are — I can tell you — the right way is for civil service , and we have a lot of ways to get the information to us .
And so we use a very highly valuable reserve to shift materials from one place to the Internet , to clean up the signs so that it can be shipped with legal persons like Swedes and Bilbao .
We get information from the cloud , from the cloud industry , from Ross Square , or whatever , common news organizations like that , founding — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about giving massive information to people and then protecting yourself against the illegal and political governments .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to figure out why to make sure that the documents are real , but you never really know what the scale is .
Julian Sanguay : That &apos;s right , we &apos;re always fighting it out . And if we get to a stage , we quickly release the information .
( Phones ) God knows .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : So I think these are some of the pieces and you &apos;re asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look up .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and then what happened ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , so it &apos;s a coral report .
This was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared in 2004 after the elections .
Before 2004 , the government had turned 18 .
He was an age-old Kenyan treatment .
And when the book came out — based on the authoritarian governments that were trying to decide how to fix this report , they bought 20 million pounds of report on that report , and so on .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to fight its political will , which was the wealthiest people — now the wealthiest people in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why it was launched in 2007 , and we were successful in getting it out of the fine election before December 2008 .
When we got that report , three days later , we decided to philanthropy Kabul with the guy that he was horrified , Daniel Arppe Miyi , so this report went down and found himself in the middle of nowhere .
CA : And — so , I mean , just to mention this briefly — it &apos;s happened in Kenya , not from the military , but from the mean , it &apos;s transformed the result of your choice .
Julian Sanguay : Yes . This is a hotshot spot in Hardin , and then it happened in all the six countries of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , a few days later , trusted the Kenyan innovator to talk about it .
And it was on television for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of vacations , based on an online sex report , and it changed the result of selection .
CA : Wow , so how did your mindset actually change the world ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re going to show a little video of a little cluster of live video .
This video is long , but here &apos;s a little clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a heart video .
RD : It &apos;s tough when you first put two of them together .
I thought , oh , there are four with them .
The road is clean . Now it &apos;s okay . Galileo &apos;s gone .
When they &apos;re on your show , tell me . Gold .
All dollars .
Hold on !
( Machine noises ) Galileo walks . Galileo walks . ( Machine noises ) Galileo rides .
Hotel — two engineers , two big teachers .
We should move now , time is up !
Okay , so now we &apos;ve taken eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two old Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Roger . They &apos;re on my side .
Two , two , six , we &apos;re on the roof .
Ah , what a conspiracy . What happened ?
God bless you , Hebrew . Good luck . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what did it do ?
Julian Sanging : The people who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people excited about it .
These were the first three wars that happened .
CA : So 11 people killed in that attack , right ? Two humble guys ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah ! Two guys on the Royal Rights , two little kids cheated .
Generally , 18 out of 26 people died .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of anger .
What was the origin of that regret , you know ?
Julian Sanguay : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as a very , very unequal force .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the grass , and then a kilometer away from the propellant helicopter , 30 miles away , are starting to pollinate every single one of them — all of them — and they &apos;re also giving birth to the parents .
They also had two journalists who weren &apos;t very good at this , because they were very journalistic .
Chris Anderson : The U.S. intelligence agency got arrested with Broadmining , and it said he had acknowledged that he had acknowledged this video to you , over 280,000 and a half American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Singer : So we decided to accept the documents .
Five days earlier , it was estimated that 150,000 documents were made and 50 .
But we &apos;ve now given them a catalyst to a U.S. safety house in Rwanda in the beginning of the year , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I went to this safari house a lot .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of applications for the American safety house ...
Julian Sangley : We &apos;re giving them things . ( CA : Would you do that ? ) Julian Sangley : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sangley : Because things like this show that , in fact , what the Arab states are doing is violating human rights violations in these governments .
If you look at the hidden documents , the material is within them .
CA : Talk about that .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is that correct ?
Julian Sanguay : So the question is , what is the important information in the world , what is the information that can &apos;t be transformed .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out there , when you want to get the information out , you want to do something better , because the organizations know it better , and they know the stories , they also care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks to this as an individual or a collective society , where there &apos;s an unexpected way to think about it ?
Julian Sanguay : We didn &apos;t have the documents with them .
I mean , our biggest obstacle is practice .
We collect information in a particular way that &apos;s private — the information that &apos;s available to somebody else .
But there are also some mysteries — like your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a mystery — but we &apos;re talking about these civil servants who come in and out of nowhere .
CA : OK , so they do it with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think the father , whose daughter is working in the United States Senate , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had something so profound that some people like to attack other people .
It shows an American science of dead people .
What this does is — but it has given millions of people around the world that the United States is political .
Although they &apos;re not my daughter , who are you going to say ? What would you say ?
Julian Sanguay : Here &apos;s how we get asked so many questions .
But in remembrance , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people don &apos;t have to watch videos , so they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference in their feelings , it doesn &apos;t make any difference in their experience .
Because they see it every day .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and their thinking that gives them money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you seem to be hopeful for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it make any sense to you that in order to reveal this light , you have to be able to maintain privacy in the same way that you would ?
Julie Singer : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the kind of information that is being abused by other minds .
If they do that , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us to do that , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to increase their jobs later on .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , what we &apos;ve heard so far is — this is an insight into this .
You may also realize that there will be different ideas about the Lickens and the Jews .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or the problem .
What is a hero &apos;s perspective ?
And what is the problem ?
Julian Sanguay : Oh ! Something should be going on .
CA : That &apos;s a lot of good people , really good people .
We &apos;re going to try and do it . The forces are another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Now , this is a very interesting story , which is a very old one , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanguay : This is a model of what we do almost every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — a lot of important pieces came out in the banana in November , as the cells were in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report card — which was a very good analysis of this — that said that , in fact , conservation agencies were very opposed to different types of oil companies who were stepping up there and they were burning .
And there were some Vienna governments there , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult job for us .
We didn &apos;t know who was writing and who was relevant .
And so we were surprised that perhaps this company did this in a competitive game .
So we picked it up , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
This stuff is fine , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t imagine it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the same week that he wrote , and he wanted to figure out the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to figure out the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re talking about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how good you are for him ?
Is that really yours ? Well , they brought us that look at Scripture with the name of the manufacturer with the name of Microsoft World Wide .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
This is a way of reading and predicting what the materials are , and that is to write and try to get the letters from these people .
CA : All right . So , any information from BP ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , we &apos;ve got a lot of stuff , I mean , at that time , we &apos;re going to collect a bunch of stuff and make it as difficult as possible .
For this reason , our shortcut for poetry has become somewhat more useful in a few months because we improve our waste system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s fluid .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing , more than our capabilities are placed on us because of our increased growth , and that means that we have a large number of civic services available to us , but we don &apos;t have a lot of people who can repair and predict information .
CA : So that &apos;s a real problem , basically , why would you want to have a journalist or a journalist &apos;s dream ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the materials that we have in common have to deal with , so we have to develop the institution to be able to bring people together that really has to deal with a lot of sensitivity with the materials of public safety , and then a little bit less awareness around the business .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanguay : Yes , my parents were in the movie business and then moving away from the neighborhood , so the two reasons were influenced .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so it &apos;s like all things together can produce artificial intelligence .
( Applause ) JN : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a little bit of a hero at a young age and you got to the notion of working very quickly .
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a recruitment worker from a very young age .
I wrote an email , and I was the girl at the time when I was attacked by this crime .
That &apos;s why you have to respect the word .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that you can use different things .
Sadly , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian Maathai that has been used to eliminate your grandmother &apos;s banking .
That &apos;s why the word , no longer very useful as it was .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what do you think of the core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some event in their lives that has helped them keep them safe ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s going on .
But the basic value is that good , affordable and difficult people are not producing the caregivers ; they &apos;re growing their caregivers .
And that &apos;s the greatest lesson I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and hard people in my life .
CA : Can people not produce enough and enough employees ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a junior man , so I &apos;m not very good at raising , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of raising a chicken , which is close to the police department .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve just got this in the last few minutes : What happened in Iceland ?
Basically you published something out there , you got a problem with a bank , and then you published a story with a lot of controversy .
Instead , they blamed you for your time .
So you &apos;re very famous in Iceland . So what happened ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ice Land had a social crisis .
There it was .
The banking center there grew into the global GDP .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the state Taliban , which had just been published five minutes ago , looked like a movie : feature-proof nonviolence , and the state of the News Railway was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming , and we &apos;re very famous in Iceland , I went to Iceland and talked about this issue .
And there were parts of the people there that shouldn &apos;t be , and as a result , the Ice Landers , working with some other international mentors , we proposed a new kind of Ice Land law that would be a kind of freedom media landscape , for the most protected area in the world , for the new Nepal printers to free .
A country like Ice Land is like a nurse , which means it &apos;s going upward from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Icelandic Parliament put it perfectly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look towards the future , did you realize that the more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see electric power , or is it going to do this ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure to counter the law of liberty and the law of transparency around the world — in Europe , in China and in the United States .
Who is it going to be ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so this is a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move from one side to the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m making a translation of listeners that I call glide , appreciation , and all the power for you .
Julian Sanguay : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was absolutely obsessed with food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching both .
So I did this , which is a milkweed .
I was watching my childhood Connecticut regime , and I was watching these videos fail .
When I got older and got home in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team settled .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view , I realized how the rest of the world thinks about it ?
And when I went to the last few months , wherever I was shocked by the North Carolina , Piracy , or the Indus Valley , repeatedly showing four species of cattle to the cattle of neighborhood — good , tough , common and code .
And I thought this was a big bizarre thing , and I was surprised to see if anyone had ever gotten the touch of this curve .
And when I went to visit him , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at the Catholic team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
There is no unusual humanity to constrain the natural world into a few elements .
This is the work that we did 10,000 years ago when we cleaned ourselves up .
If you look at the fire from 10,000 years ago , they look like rocks and sludge , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : salmon , cow , wheat and chickens .
It &apos;s also good for the fly .
If you look at the mines of New York City about 150 or 200 years ago , they look like footage , football and dunes .
But if you look at the far end of the spectrum , you &apos;re only going to have four waves left coming in — the train , the wheels , but also the turtle .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Shire .
This is a brand new problem .
We &apos;ve been doing this for 50 years .
The Second World War gave us the greatest incentive to be strong .
In the midst of the great war , we grew technology , such as the Sun , the plutonium , and so on , the whole thing collapsed .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have seen the tremendous increase in prevention rates .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soap operas and the soap operas have increased , and within two years , its profits have been increasing , collectively .
Now if you collect rainfall and forest pollution , it &apos;s equivalent to two Chinese births every year from the ocean .
My Chinese counterparts are not the only thing that &apos;s going to happen , because China is not the largest border , but it &apos;s also the largest border .
Let &apos;s go to your square legs .
The first is the U.S. and the West &apos;s most utilized salmon food .
The forest canopy is an extremely bad battle .
Only one pound of jellyfish will take five , 10 , 15 pounds of food to the market .
Edinburgh to the marketplace is also unbelievable .
In a study done in Darfur University , it showed that gasoline sequesters are extremely ineffective in terms of carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That whose forests belong in the forests are the forests of Mongolia .
Now look at these nice faces .
It puts the footprint of the Earth in its place , and the protection of the coast , the yeast , and the yeast , all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the recent campaign .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years building millions of coastal plants .
Another thing that &apos;s happening here is what the philosopher Mark Bentham calls &quot; &quot; Nehru . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the track record , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now , some of the things that are happening are that the little algae are falling apart from the nest , but with it , with a very large number of other leaves , they accumulate the other leaves , and then they change the food in the cow .
And many times they get a job with slaves , which are called &quot; &quot; Red &quot; &quot; chewing gum . It &apos;s the slime mold that we like to see on the river , which means changing it in fresh food , which means that the ecosystem is eating itself and making itself beautiful .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You need to look at large areas to organize flexibly .
Our own area , what the real Federal Management or ICCAT calls &quot; &quot; ICCAT . &quot; &quot; The International Commission is to protect the touch .
Carl Simpson also became a great advocate for reading all of his teeth .
We can flip through the mountain , but the mountain is not good enough .
A lot of people don &apos;t know , but a lot of people do .
It can span over 40 miles a gallon , and it can heat over 20 degrees Celsius of its environment .
So all of the ideas for the last mile are running out .
The flesh is filled with blood which no longer flows .
This is the best protein .
But the forest creature , which is 40 miles away , cannot be stored in the form .
Even the time has been well-established , it doesn &apos;t require that it &apos;s been well-established .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was breaking down .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a dot .
There are over 3,000 dives in the politics of connectome .
I say connectome is mostly people — ( Laughter ) — if anyone solves the power of content , I think we can make the world a better place .
And everywhere , ladies and gentlemen , these are the rocks that are prevented from giving to the children of Somalia .
As a result , we have a successful leap of faith in spontaneous performance .
When the space shuttle began , the space shuttle took six pounds to build a foundation .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , you get one of these little blobs of water , because if you look at the Freeman &apos;s Facebook page , they name the Same Pond in a Free way .
Whereas this Food Fund is prepared with honey .
It &apos;s hard to say something about parallel and parallel .
But then again , the credit card industry is pushing to the bricks-and-mouth industry .
That &apos;s the system that &apos;s producing cooking , and it &apos;s producing cooking , and it &apos;s producing cooking .
This is seven percent per annum .
Even though we &apos;re spending a little bit less money getting into the market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money .
We don &apos;t just eat milkweed as much as we eat milkweed and milkweed .
We have what makes the beehive and the beehive that is left behind .
Because on top of it , the blood and the blood and the blood vessels and so on add up to the poles .
I wonder if there &apos;s a mockingbird that has caught fire and caught fire .
India was first or dead . ( Laughter ) And as a result , this is a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of food waste in the 20s that have been cleared out from the ocean .
This is the third part of China , or the number of people in the United States who get out of the ocean every year .
The last thing in four sentences is this .
The Philadelphia actually started as an elevator .
And it started to look like the owner of a local financial firm saw that the next day , the next day , no one would ever be on a McDonald &apos;s .
He went to the park and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s see what happens .
Who would be more likely to be sentenced to the oceans was a testimony that Halloween did not kill .
So he built his own lifetime scenario .
Unfortunately , the census came in 30 centimeters .
He wanted to make a 25-centimeter probe , so he arranged the Atlantic Code .
Actually , Philadelphia is the largest mass-industrial art industry in the United States , between 23 and 3 billion pounds a year from the Pacific .
If we end the policies , the alternative would be tripled .
Twenty years ago , nobody knew anything about Tilonia .
It changes the plant protein in a very efficient way , and that &apos;s for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very solvable solution ; it &apos;s coming from one individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a mockingbird .
It doesn &apos;t even have the ACE and DDI we we think it &apos;s going to keep us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That represents over 20 to three million tons .
A chance for conservation workers to expect us to eat it ?
Could we lead instead of giving it to peace ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , which is the typical slave upon slave upon slave upon slave upon slave upon slaves .
This is among the top three , EPA and DIY .
So this is her ability .
But instead of giving us a few dollars &apos; worth of pay or a few dollars &apos; worth of pay or a few dollars &apos; worth of pay , and then we flipped the pay off to the back of the head and said , &quot; &quot; Can we clean this cup of food ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is the domestic bonds .
They also have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
The Indus calculus has a profound effect .
Indonesia &apos;s meat is only three parts per million .
In fact , most of the three are not from the grass .
The ocean is three times the size of the sea floor , so they just come together .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algae , we have a quantum locker for the use of Facebook and neurotransplantation .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , and that &apos;s why the oceans die .
As you might think about a clip , there are more than three protons , and more than three , these are very effective signals .
It &apos;s just as basic .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a facility that can provide value to preventing ocean protein .
It has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be EPA , DHA OMG3 and Pete East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But try not to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million in the ocean .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening now .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , the problem is gone .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was there to study the big brain because I have a brother who is susceptible to mental illness .
More or less , I wanted to understand , as a scientist , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they don &apos;t connect their dreams to a common reality and they act on it .
So I stopped looking for intense mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked with Dr. Fancing Bank , who was in the field of psychology at Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in people &apos;s brains that generally seek answers to differences in physiology than in people &apos;s brains that are occupying Shakespeare &apos;s psychiatry or BBC &apos;s psychiatry ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is create a map of the microbial microscopic spectrum of the brain , whose cells are messing with the chemical and how much they do ?
So there was a lot of privilege in my life because I was doing this kind of research on the day , but on a weekly basis , I was on a pilot &apos;s journey to the NAMI in Newcastle .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I had to find out that I was faced with an intelligent CD .
There was a new lying on the left side of my brain .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
In the morning of the year , I was able to read and write and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a similar brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is a part of the brain that &apos;s left behind with a wrist on the back of my brain , and this will be held in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you show two parts of the brain which are completely different .
For those of you who think computers , on the right side of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left parts of our brain operates like a solar processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the cracks of the Column Currently , which is covered with 300 volumes of interest .
But there are also two parts of it .
Because they think of information in a different way , each individual &apos;s identity has to understand information in a very different way , and their minds are different than other things , and so let me just let you know who their identities are very different from each other .
Encouragement — Thank you very much .
Interviewer : Yes , there are many things .
( Laughter ) So our brains are only scratching the surface and thinking about this moment .
Here we are now thinking of images of our brains in a way that is organically thought of by our bodies .
Information is stored and stored in our bodies in the form of energy , in the form of our whole nervous system , and then it &apos;s transformed into a giant almond-shaped classroom that , in the present moment , we think about what it is in the present moment and how it feels and how it feels .
I &apos;m an energy bound by the energy around me by the right brain .
We &apos;re using energy from one another to the right of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we are brilliant at this planet whose willingness to make the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the best and the most beautiful .
Our brain is a very different place .
Our brains are wired scientifically and politically .
The rest of our brain is about the past and the future .
Based on the left of the brain is how we take the largest aluminum / cloud that we have today , and we begin to collect and then collect these analyses .
And it also informs all this information that is organized and embedded in the past , all these things that we &apos;ve ever learned and all the possibilities of tomorrow , namely the effects of our projects .
Our brain is thinking of the left-hand part of the synthesis of language .
It &apos;s a sequence of conversations that really touches our inner world and our inner world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me how to go home and buy and remember .
I &apos;m going to need them in the morning , and this is the consciousness of my calculus book , which reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that speaks to me ! I am !
And as my brain always says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become a little extreme .
I become one of the only people around me with incredible energy and excitement .
And most of my brain was dead this morning by the phoenix .
The morning of the calving face , my eyes were swallowed with pain behind my eyes .
It was the same kind of pain that comes from the eye of an eye .
And that pain just dragged me and left me .
And then he left .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never suffered from any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No way , I start my daily work . &quot; &quot; So I walked around and I put on my cardboard cardboard cardboard , which is a machine of physical exercise .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , because I feel like my hand is the fifth of an initial person that touches the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is such a strange thing . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is such a strange , poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like I had changed my mind , which is the general sense of the truth , which is that I &apos;m a person who &apos;s playing around with this experience , but now I &apos;ve been in a kind of humble and mysteri@@
And it was all very strange and poor , and my brain was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started moving around the room , and I felt like everything was going on inside my body .
And everybody thought very hard and very hard .
There &apos;s no connection in my speed , and I think there &apos;s a home that &apos;s required , so I just focus on the inner system .
I grew up in my underwater chamber , and I was actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , and I have to play you now .
Oh , my foot goes down , and then my balance goes up and down the wall .
I reached out and looked at my hands , and I realized that I could no longer repair my body .
I have no idea where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand has held the atoms and the minerals with the atoms and the minerals .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the stuff on the left of my brain got completely silent .
It was like someone was speaking the T.V. radio .
There &apos;s a silver lining .
First of all , I was surprised by the fragility of my brain .
But then immediately , the energy came into the platform in this huge space that was around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt enormous grief and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; Come on , you &apos;re in trouble . &quot;
So we need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I &apos;m really addicted to the problem , but I came back to the very same consciousness that I would say for a lot of money .
But they were beautiful places .
Consider how beautiful it is to be completely irrelevant to this fragile brain that keeps you close to the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere where that I do , and I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere .
I felt so much weight in my body .
And consider all of your relationships that come from the outside world and have been degraded by some stress .
And I felt a sense of peace and quiet .
And measure what it would look like if you step back from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you lived up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I sort of set up a mess .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got locked in and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , wait a minute .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should be helping my spirit , so I &apos;m pouring neck from the back of my house and I &apos;m walking into my apartment right now and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And at that point my data has become completely obsessed .
At that time , I realized that my God was going to attack me , the next thing that my mind tells me is , how great it is !
( Laughter ) How awesome !
Someone who is a brain scientist who sees this opportunity to realize their own brain , and they come from inside — ( Laughter ) — and then one month comes to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very well-meaning woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to wiggle . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; All right , I can &apos;t stop the fighting of science , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I have to call for help . I have to call my work . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my first job , and then I remembered that I had my budget card on my phone number .
So I go to my studio room and I open up a three-story motorcycle card .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eye what my marketing looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you this is my card , because I don &apos;t see any frame of reference .
And the maps of the words would be helped by the maps and the symbols , and I wasn &apos;t learning anything .
And then I started waiting for him to tell me the story .
And at that moment , the typical truth reconnected , and I learned that it wasn &apos;t a card ; it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this damn thing .
And during that period , the effects of the invasion of the fuel in 45 minutes were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any path .
So I take the phone and I plug it in there .
I took a budget card and I put it there , and now I &apos;m looking at the cards , and I &apos;m looking at the cards , and I &apos;m looking at the phone , and I &apos;m looking at the cards , and I &apos;m looking at the cards .
But then I switch to my own halfway back when I was coming back , and I didn &apos;t remember I &apos;d gotten that number .
So I raised my hand like a Danish and I raised my hand to Indonesia , and I pressed my hand to the other hand that when I came back to the normal truth , I can tell you that I was here first in India , and I finally came back from all over India , and I heard that the phone rang up on my wrist , and a guy stood up and he said to me , &quot; &quot; Whoa . &quot; &quot; (
So I say to her , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking personally , I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Wooo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak a language , and I couldn &apos;t understand until I tried .
So he realized that I needed help and he needed help .
And shortly afterwards , in one of the ambulances , Sierra Leone was occupying the other Michelin National Guard .
I walked around looking like a toddler .
Just like the poor man who kept his eyes awake and poor , I pulled the energy out and felt my soul shaking .
And it occurred to me at that moment that I was no longer in my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or gives me a second life .
By the time I left , I was surprised and amazed that I still am .
When I felt like I was devastated to giving my spirit , I said God saved my life .
Now my brain was divided into two different facts .
It was at that time that my emotional system began to develop emotions that were only emotionally in pain .
Lightning lit my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were so close and so bright that I couldn &apos;t hear a voice from the background , or I didn &apos;t hear a voice , and I was just scribbling the path .
Because I couldn &apos;t understand my body &apos;s question , so I felt so much bigger and so much like a person who was free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant hillside in the ocean of silence .
The Great Divergence .
I found the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking it would never be possible that I would find my own great sense of being able to understand the inside of a small body .
But it occurred to me at that time , &quot; But I am still alive . &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought to sleep .
And if I &apos;m brought in neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is , I can get the neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world like this that &apos;s filled with lovely , fresh , comfortable and loving people who know that they can ever feel that quality .
And they can pick up John and choose , and that &apos;s the truth that they want to take their books off the left side of their brain and step on their own search for this pure quality .
And then I realized how powerful this experiment could be , &quot; &quot; What is the lesson of the design that has taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a frantic stroke , the southern hemisphere picked up the blood vessel from my brain , which was the sadness center of my brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the most powerful force of life with the skills and the two extremely powerful souls .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world who we are and what we want to be .
Where I can step to the right of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , and I am the power of life .
Fifty lovely , beautiful , matriar-derived molecular cells , one in which everybody is .
Or I can choose to step back to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a tight form .
Quantum fluctuation .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And where ?
And I think as long as we spend our left-brained grid on the right-hand side of the brain , as long as we can promote peace in this world , and our planet will be very safe .
And I thought , you know , we need to redesign this .
Thank you .

Good morning !
Are you going to go ?
They wrote my name for Tiger , but I &apos;d like to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little over a decade ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was forced to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have a free food chain in Arabic ?
He looked at me in a strange way , thinking he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The restaurant , the romance of the food . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minority , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minority . &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot;
He was talking to me three people , as he said to himself , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see it ! &quot;
What does the word &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy decided to focus a girl on two words and instead .
How can he speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got tired of it .
Yes !
What is it that I have in my country that deserves the right to speak ?
Where does this happen ?
How did we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I &apos;m like a lot of people , who come to this stage in their lives , where they basically leave everything that &apos;s in their pocket , just because they like to say , and they &apos;re terrible .
Should I be willing to bring all of my culture , all of my ideas , all of my ideas and aspirations ?
It may be that we have the most important wars in the stories of children .
Do they want to send me all the things that I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
How does that make sense ?
And yet , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision about the state of mind that I did for myself .
The Arabic language doesn &apos;t cover the needs of today .
It &apos;s not science , it &apos;s research , it &apos;s the language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we rely on when we work on a curriculum project , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use to translate to WHO .
If we do that , they will cover us .
So where can I exploit it ? We can all ask the questions !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s one more important fact that we need to think about .
It &apos;s the Arab mother tongue .
Research says that you have to overcome your mother &apos;s language to get the skills in other languages .
In other languages , the skills of the mother tongue are fundamental to the creative appearance .
How ?
Gabriel Gabriel , when he started writing , used Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imagination and philosophy were influenced by a little boy in this village where he grew up , felt a certain sense of happiness , felt a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn their letters in English , you feel the same sense of happiness , you feel the same sense .
You can imagine that this is their manuscript in English , this little girl who lives in the village in Beijing .
So , this is an example that no refugee can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill her language .
It &apos;s a fact of emerging societies .
Germany , France , Germany and Chinese , all of these things are happening .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in resource , spending a lot of money on advertising and so on .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset is not reaching yet , and we want to reach this developing world .
They were countries like ours at a time , but they decided to try to make progress , research , and they went to countries , like Turkey , employee , etc . , and they went with their language as if they were leaving the schools , just like Hurricane .
They brought him close to him .
Because if you &apos;re a product of Toyota or whatever , and it &apos;s not written on Toyota , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be involved in these offices , not in the characters , like we are more time .
So to create new innovations and new solutions , they needed to save their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Conduction , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will remind you ?
What do you understand ?
No matter who , how and how .
Languages are not just about talking ; words are just about our minds .
Language is a sign of a particular step in our lives , and the words that are separated from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Piracy , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special circuit in your brain — special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our minds ?
How would you say you understood it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the time of the freedom slogan ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , I better leave and I don &apos;t spend a lot of time talking about slavery .
The fact is , these affections remind us of a particular thing .
I have a French speaker friend who &apos;s a French speaker .
One time I was asking her what happened .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I tried to nurture his husband and translate what he meant to be provocative . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A hundred women got it wrong , and then spent the whole night trying to figure it out .
He wondered , how could it be so obvious ?
Does she want to make herself ?
&quot; &quot; Bury Me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his husband , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; his way of thinking is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me for a day , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I felt when I heard February . &quot; &quot; Beautiful women tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and you gave it to him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I hold my hand and I hold you . &quot; &quot; (
She translated . She showed me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do for the free speech ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started the Arabic language protector .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whatever it is , grind it . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The main defense of the Arabic language forced a message , which is , &quot; I speak to you in the East , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this in our own way , because , like , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody tells me , I hate speaking Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to live our dreams , our aspirations , our daily lives .
That &apos;s how we feel and how we feel .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I talk to you in the East , but you answer the West . &quot; &quot; Be the right sign .
Very simple , but very effective .
Later , we started another dance with the land of letters .
You &apos;ve seen an example from the outside , a context in which the letters are in the halls of black and blue tape , with the text , &quot; Don &apos;t kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to find a presence for ourselves .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great deal of being a victim , a modern and religious person .
Later on , we took pictures of boys and girls who had just been read Arabic scripts .
Cole images of girls and girls .
We are so cold !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Huh ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve put the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; He wants to make a double bind , but I have a word that &apos;s good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money ! We shouldn &apos;t save ourselves .
But to get to that point , we need to convince everybody that we &apos;re not going to allow anybody to grow up , or that we &apos;re going to have the authority on our language , to push ourselves , to push ourselves , to push our patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the cells , or we can &apos;t replicate the rocket , and so on , we can be creative .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the global level .
He can re-branch the Arabic script .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know , and we have to assume that there is a solution , that we should be part of the solution .
Ultimately , what can you do today ?
Who are you tweeting ?
For the sake of compassion , I urge you , even though , my time is over , or Arabic , or English , or France or Chinese .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latino characters !
( Applause ) It &apos;s exhausting ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for the protection of this language .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , recognizes her father through language .
When my daughter &apos;s born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I promised my daughter &apos;s light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; thank
And you don &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this cultural copy . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to him so that he reminds us that our presence is not a miracle , that I am being blessed by those poor fathers who are asking my people for forgiveness until you see my generation without being banked by giving us that generation of inequality does not mean well to our generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after being known to gi@@
( Applause )
I love chocolate dots .
In college , my primary textbook was a grant , which meant I had to write a lot of material .
Now a normal person writes something , so this approach will work .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do the job quickly , but the first week you do a lot of work , and then more work later , everything &apos;s done , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is all going to be prepared , but the actual work of the literature is going to be on the top , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all the text messages .
And then again , there &apos;s a whole new paper of research , a paper that you can do in a year .
And I knew that my normal action wasn &apos;t good enough for this kind of value .
It was a huge task .
I set up a plan , and I decided that I would do something like this .
This is how it &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m going to start small , middle class , pace of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to zoom in on it more like a learner .
How hard is learning going to be ?
There &apos;s no big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many weeks ago ?
Come and go , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) But then they went away , and I didn &apos;t even write anything , and we were just there .
And two weeks went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went one day and I spent three days going online , and I didn &apos;t even write a word until now , and what I could do was write a word in 72 houses , and I put 90 pages on it , two streets on it — people shouldn &apos;t follow two streets on it — it was sticking in the background , spending time in the slow motion , and then I went online and I did all
I thought , this is it .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk about your cause . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s fine . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Let &apos;s look at it today , that &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t trusted . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited from that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My Roger always refers me to six people , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that lists of people making differences in the brain compared to six people .
To find out , I took a leaf blood vessel where I analyzed both brains of the same way and performed the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but look at it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of these brains have decisions for centuries , but the stereotype is in the brain of the stereotype .
Now what does that mean for a listener ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; It &apos;s the best time to make a difference &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; A wise person would make a decision to make a difference , but the instructor didn &apos;t like the project , so he got the word to the boss , and he said , &quot; &quot; Look at the pages of the pages of the pages of the pages of the pages of the pages of the pages of the pages of the pages of
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go to the pub , and see , in 10 minutes , something new has added ?
Later on , you &apos;re going to watch YouTube as it starts to talk about the honor of the love of the crossword puzzle and eventually end up watching television on the Mother &apos;s Day .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while for all of these things , so it &apos;s not going to save a lot of time these days .
What a contract ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not just about compassion that you want to give .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t know what the future is ; it &apos;s just two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all right .
If you know how many and you spend your entire life getting better and easier , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there is a generation of human animals .
Good food , good thought , and an increased generation , maybe in rural areas .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , you haven &apos;t been paying attention .
We are an advanced civilization , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re moving away .
We make big projects .
And he thinks all of these things .
And we just want to say what we do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes it seems just as if they were eating simple and pleasant fruit flies just as if they were eating , sleeping or feeling at moments of opportunity .
It &apos;s a shame for that .
Sometimes they agree .
And sometimes it seems more right to do what &apos;s hard for a big purpose .
And this is the pinnacle .
And for the listeners , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet season , a simple and permanent path that tends to be out of the window .
I call it an archive .
( Laughter ) The Dark Line is a place where people are so well-known .
There &apos;s a sense of urgency at this time when you don &apos;t have to be compassionate .
The other thing that brings you to the dark field is actually no longer true because it &apos;s not true of you , it &apos;s true of spacial crime , fear , seriousness , and self-hatred — all the properties that are in the good lists .
The question is , in this way , when the output is dominated , how does a listener get into a voice box that is less happy , but is more important ?
It turns out that the Sistine people also assume protection , which is preserving all the time in their exact moments — someone called him the household .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly Swedish , but when David lines up , it becomes really interesting , or at this point when people are at risk of embarrassment , of loss of employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that it only works by itself .
Now I had a relationship with it in my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and gave me a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My wish was to participate in TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the midst of my generosity , there was something else going on in the brain that made decisions for centuries .
He was saying , &quot; Did you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google , and look at the map of India at the bottom of the 20,000-foot map , we &apos;ll just break it down until we see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So this day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a month later , people at TED decided to give the names of protagonists .
I downloaded the Web , and there was a photograph of me holding onto it .
And who was the author ?
( Laughter ) The house was under control , and within seconds the system was under control . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the street — he fell on the tree !
And finally , and finally , long-term decision-makers can send books and I can start talking .
Now a household that tells the story of every type of gesture , someone like me would give it two weeks , and the beginning of the article would never be heard , and then a remarkably unbelievable endeavor of task shifting overnight and writing .
And the total of three apartments at this moment — they call the system of the listeners .
It &apos;s not very good , so it &apos;s not linear .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote it , I was surprised by the impact of it .
In fact , I got thousands of miles from all over the world and from all walks of life , from all walks of life .
They included narrators , facilitators , engineers , penetrators , and also bigger CDs .
( Laughter ) And nearly one thing was saying and writing : &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this issue . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails that were asked and the number of emails that were sent .
He was lying in the script of these people , writing about how much checklist he did in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are all these people in the dark ?
Turns out , there are two things on the list .
Today I gave you all examples , talking about things , all of their data lines .
And when the data is online , the effects of the retroviral drugs are dying because of the housing that comes in .
But there &apos;s a different kind of side to the table , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any digital lines .
So if you want a job that you start yourself as an art or a commercial — like some art or a commercial , when you don &apos;t start to self-focus , to focus on the work .
In addition to doing the work , there are many other things that David Lanne does not work with , like being in his family , exercising , thinking about your health , understanding your relationships , telling your relationships well that you &apos;re not being coupled .
Now , if the only way to get a job is to get a job in the Sistine River , it &apos;s hard , because all of this data is in the context of the house that &apos;s being lost .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The good news is that you can &apos;t catch them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of longitudinal magic trick that comes to very little attention and talks about less than just death , a kind of crucified magic trick .
You &apos;re getting better at details from noise and bad news .
And this could be the driving force of the Taliban and the Left Behind .
So I thought , this is why they email , and this is why they &apos;re in the rain .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
Twale death set them up to watch , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot afford to pay for their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails , and one thing was clear : I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think all of you are lists .
It may not be that complicated . Some of us , ( Applause ) And perhaps some of us are good at connecting with some of the digital lines , but remembering the paths when the digital lines don &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block represents a week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been exchanged .
I think we all need to go to the blackboard .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in our careers , because there &apos;s no time in every life .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s essential for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that many families there , maybe we should start to do it .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days in the U.S. and Afghanistan , an access to the U.S. and Afghanistan was leaving one province in Afghanistan , leaving one province in Afghanistan , helping provide a support to a security operation in Afghanistan , helping provide an office to provide a protection for Afghan operations to provide a sanctuary in order to provide a sanctuary to provide a sanctuary
He walked into the vicinity of an attack , and he was surrounded by three and many other things , and he watched as a child by the time Captain Seventeen burning Captain Seventine , and he watched as a child as a child to save the chickens and bring the dead .
Among the eight-year-old families , one Sergeant and another , a Spanish doctor , was pushing to a helicopter , and he was also pushing a helicopter .
So it &apos;s been shown that the Cape Town and Ice Shelf refer to this mysterious magic trick that burns during the Gold Rush .
They put them in the helicopter , and then you see the Caspian Seventines burning and giving them a hug before they can save others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something about it .
Here &apos;s a lovely one , and I knew why I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , they &apos;re going to give you access to those people who want to experience themselves in order to benefit others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to try to test others in order to benefit us .
We have an electronic calculator !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these people are better off .
That &apos;s why they stay close to the fire .
These are better people moving towards this vision of service , and these are better people moving towards this vision of service .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have a dense environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so that each of us has the ability to work together and extend it so that we have the capacity to do this in others .
I have the privilege of meeting some of these people , whom we would say yesterday , I have the privilege of meeting with some of these people , what we would say yesterday is that they took you and their lives to risk saving others , and I asked myself , why can you do this ?
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing because they do it for me .
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The challenge in the imagination of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not prisons .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Pass me , &quot; &quot; and you do it .
It may not be that I &apos;m giving two people a coordination and they &apos;re doing it .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an inspiration .
So where does it come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago , at the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all those branches are highly focused on us .
Nothing personal .
Wanting is a lack of resources , a long-term TEDster , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce the course of our lives , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce the course of our lives .
And so we &apos;re ready for social animals , where we are together and working together as part of what I call a faith , as in a closet where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we felt secure and we felt a natural response .
It &apos;s got constant waves .
It means I can sleep at night and I can scratch the surface of some of the risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern world is like this .
These are the kinds of things that are trying to make our lives difficult or try to reduce our success .
It can lead to a very discreet case of stock markets .
It could be a new technology that will disrupt your business landscape at night , and it could be a new technology that will disrupt your business landscape at night .
Or it could be your opponent , which sometimes tries to hug you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to push you out of business , but at least it &apos;s trying to break your progress and try to pull your business away from you , and it &apos;s trying to drive your progress and take your business away from you .
We have no authority on these powers .
It &apos;s a constant thing , and it &apos;s never going to end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is , because that belief is what defines direction .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in her organization and their lives that are protecting the people in her organization and their lives , and to try to test their own personal and fallible results so that people are there and that they can test their own personal and fallible results so that people can feel secure and feel their personal connections , so that they can compromise things .
I was on a vacuum trip , and I noticed an occasion that when a passenger had tried to leave before he was released , and I watched the staff on the door as he passed the law just as he was crying .
The first time I tried to walk on it , the first time I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you using things like brushing ?
Why can &apos;t you sit with us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And from then on , he told me exactly the same thing .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the Western Iranians is not because they rank among the best people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are broken , we spend our time and our power trying to keep you safe from each other , we spend our time and our power keeping each other safe , and as a result , our organization is degrading .
What a great leader can do is give you the best example of how to be a parent is a good leader for her , and the best example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , principles and doctrines , when they are necessary , we want to give them opportunities , education , structure and precision , when they need it , we want to give them the tools to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for themselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline , doctrine , when they need it , they want to give their people opportunities , education , structure and precision , when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to have access and failure so that they can achieve more successes that we &apos;ve never imagined before so that they can achieve more successes than ever we &apos;ve ever imagined .
Charlie Kamen , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump , New York City , says , if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever let your kid go ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people out of our organizations so that we can get people out of our organizations ?
Charley has de-animated jobs . Charlie has de-animated jobs .
If you have a job in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of effective problems .
Instead , if you &apos;re in trouble , they will mentor you , and they will help you , just like we would do for a kid who &apos;s coming home from school to Craig .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are sitting at CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are leading CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are sitting at CEOs , whose unfairly stressful and meaningful .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the fundamental principle of arithmetic .
They &apos;ve grown a dense society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the examples of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the examples of their loved ones , rather than that they &apos;ve tried their loved ones for their loved ones , rather than that they &apos;ve tried their loved ones because of their loved ones .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re proposing , not data .
Does anyone predict that Gando will give you 150 million dollars ?
Why don &apos;t they give you 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problems with it ? Absolutely not .
Good leaders will never give people the experience of saving data .
Good leaders will never give people the experience of saving data .
Instead , they &apos;re going to give people short-term data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people short-term data to save .
Baby Chip in Madison sent sent to a mini-finance company in Baby Chip Media , a mini-finance company called Barry-Wehmiller in 2008 , and they had a great deal of shopping mall , and they had 30 percent of their traffic overnight .
Now in a large mini-finance company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their own properties much later .
They needed 10 million dollars , and today , like so many companies , they brought together people like the board and they did a big job .
And Bob answered that .
You see , the Bush administration doesn &apos;t trust the Bush administration .
Instead , Bob believes in prostate cancer , and reducing prostate cancer is a lot harder and harder to reduce heart attacks .
And then they built a separate program .
That every staff , from CEO to CEO , had to put everyone in charge of four weeks without mandate .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob mentioned the program , he maintained a lot .
He said that it &apos;s better that we all have small injuries , except that some of us take far bigger injuries and get better at empathy .
They have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just as nobody expected , people began to trade each other .
What was more successful was they traded with less successful people .
Someone took five volunteers to get one to three volunteers .
Gravity is not an extreme .
I know a lot of people who are benefiting from organizations &apos;s highest hierarchy , and I know a lot of people who are benefiting from organizations &apos;s highest hierarchy that leaders are absolutely not .
They &apos;re supposed to be prostitutes , and we do what they say , because they &apos;re entitled to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in the middle of organizations who have no authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve seen the person on the left , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve seen the person on the left , and they &apos;ve seen the person on the right , and they &apos;ve seen the person on the right , and they &apos;ve seen the person transfer .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the physics that had gone out of the theater and just as the physiologists used to cook in honor , and he had to cook his men before and save anything for him .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his restaurant so he could eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders first .
We call them leaders because they take risks from somebody else , and we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be patient so that they can be safe , we call them leaders because they choose to be patient so that they can be safe , we call them leaders because they choose to be safe , so that people can be safe , and when we do that , it becomes natural responsibility for us to treat them .
They &apos;ll give us their blood , their penis and come to see that their dreams become real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and your penis and you give it to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ?
And aren &apos;t those organizations that we all want to work for ? And aren &apos;t those organizations that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little girl named Motetema in the story of Limpopo , which is right next to Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the water supply and the water supply is incredibly unreliable , as in the conditions , it &apos;s very difficult to grow in these conditions at the age of 17 , I was staying quiet with my friends in the winter sleep .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was walking in the halls , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent something that just shows up on the skin and doesn &apos;t cover you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this stuff . &quot; &quot; And I left , and I did some research and I had some amazing statistics .
Today , more than two and a half billion people don &apos;t have access to water and protection .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and there are only a few in South Africa .
Different diseases come into the environment called the most dangerous trachoma .
A reflex that occurs in the eye of the trauma is the fact that you can be independent from one of the more revolutions in the trachoma .
This disease kills eight million people every year on a permanent basis , and the most amazing thing is , to save your trachoma , you only have to give up : no eggs , no flowers , no engineering .
After looking at these Afghan statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing this for myself , and I don &apos;t want to cheat , but I &apos;m doing this for at least because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I went out on my desk with 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have any Internet , I went to Google and published a study on Wikipedia
And I saw this as a particularly problematic problem for kicks .
So Maitreya was right , our formula was ready .
Now we need to do this in the process .
Four years later , after I wrote my patent on a 40-page mobile phone , I am the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say much more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mysterious alternative .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to remember it .
( Laughter ) So after the attempt to influence it in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Middle E.U. invasion of some new people , did more of it , and now we have a full-scale model , which is ready for the market , is now available in the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
He purchases just under the need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cigarettes at Alex ; he purchases one of those cigarettes on a daily basis , because that &apos;s how they look .
So we put DryBath in this creative slum .
You put it between your thumb and your back .
And the best thing is , a simple replacement of a mystery is only within five rations .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We also want DriBath — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave , and we could save two houses for children , which is two orders of magnitude , two extra houses for school , two extra houses for kids .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken out our key values , our cleanliness and our service .
DryBath is the service of a rich man and a poor man &apos;s life .
We bring this project into the process , and now we &apos;re actually entering a phase where we can actually sell it to a multinational marketplace , and a question for my listeners today , at the Limpopo Canyon , we &apos;re dealing with an analysis of 50 euros a week that doesn &apos;t have to ruin the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished , I haven &apos;t finished .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I learned a lot from this early work , last year Google challenged me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I am still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African who has accolades , and one thing that &apos;s really surprising to me is why all this money didn &apos;t want to be silent . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m glad , I &apos;m presenting some of these results to you today , and I &apos;ve been surprised to myself , who are the leading causes of success in organizations — who are actually leading to initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equality and organize them at the beginning , you will find that human potential is unprecedented .
You &apos;re going to make them possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why often fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success in the beginning .
I wanted to find out a lot of organizations about this , reflecting a lot of false ideas and misconceptions that came to me from some of the organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was building different businesses since I was 12 years old , where the Unire High School foundation was going to launch Canadian basketball steps to school , while the sun was building the tools , then the school , when I made the radio stations .
I graduated from college , and I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the Indian Libra launched , in the last 20 years , we launched more than 100 companies , failing very much .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to break down on those factors and tell you the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there &apos;s something .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; which is the last time you feel about it .
With that in mind , I thought maybe the team , the ability to be skilled or colored , are more important factors .
I never thought this was going to be the last time at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a plan for everybody , until I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It &apos;s important for a team to recognize the ability to recognize bees from the side of the car .
The vehicle is an element .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important thing .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have any explicit intervention about income ?
With that , I thought it was the most important thing for success .
Then think about innovation .
Sometimes institutions make a huge investment .
Is that the most important thing ?
After that , of course — is it time ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t ready for it ?
It &apos;s short , so are you going to come and teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or is it a long time ago , and is there a lot of terror ?
So I took a lot of respect from these five factors to many organizations .
And the idea was to go to 100 companies in Libya , and 100 others in order to find a scientific result .
So first of all , these ideas are the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com. — they &apos;re all dollars &apos; worth of commitments .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com. , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we had a lot of hope , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to incorporate all of these identities as I think these companies have moved forward .
Then in the outdoors of ideas , I saw weird successes like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Floos and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to figure out , but the most influential thing was the success and failure of all these companies , and the result struck me .
The first thing was choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent of the time is due to success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other side of the spectrum , and then I think , being different , having different ideas , it &apos;s actually a third number .
But actually , it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not true that I don &apos;t think it matters , but it surprised me that I don &apos;t think it matters most .
Sometimes it becomes more important when it &apos;s time .
Last two , business models and investment in my mind .
I think the commercial model still gets better , because you can go ahead without the commercial model , and then when the mining industry grows in the mines , include it .
And even investment , if initial investment was low , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I &apos;m here to give you some examples of all of these nonsense allies .
Take the big success of Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of investors looked at this because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to put some of their homes on the shelter ? &quot;
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons the success of compassion is because of the best commercial , ideas , and the right time to fall from business to business .
This company came in front of the financial challenges when people needed additional support , and of course they needed to help people respond to the proposals that they would give to their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best tourists .
However , time was absolutely right to make the downloads they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional income ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web message .
Goto.com , which we published at TED in 1998 , came when the companies wanted to hear more about companies .
We thought it was great , but in fact , the right time was probably more .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com. , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very good at it . With a lot of hard work and a great commercial examination , it was about working with the great philanthropists at Hollywood .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broad band was very , very low .
It was very difficult to watch online videos , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company started in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of the cockroach and dropped over 50 percent of America &apos;s Broadband , it came at the best time .
Great , good time .
The truth is , when YouTube started , there was no commercial model of it .
They didn &apos;t even believe it was going to work .
But he had a choice of extraordinary time .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
Think is very important .
But maybe time is a really important choice .
And the best way to justify time is to see if the car is actually ready for your propulsion .
And it &apos;s perfectly reasonable that what you get out of those results is not compromising , because if you like something , you want to keep it there , but in terms of time frame , you have to work very hard .
As I said , early organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
I hope some of them will help increase your success , and then it won &apos;t happen in some of the best ways .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 April 2016 we saw the biggest data center in history &#93; &#91; Financial Courts pointed out poor and powerful people &#93; &#91; Too few cash-free companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought Robert Walters to explain it . &#93; &#91; We &apos;re focusing on this weekly revolution that was brought by Gary Millions from the legal framework of the Pantheon
From the Financial State , these articles represented a small section of a small secret weapon firm .
We know the inner stories of villages , banks and villages that come with funnels like fashion finance and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a home company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messaging , you can see how they work , how they work .
It &apos;s beginning to show up .
The president of Ice Lanand is chairman .
We also have the news that polio eradication companies are working with pharmaceutical companies .
Two billion dollars of worth of stolen goods goes to the president of Russia to the Pete of his childhood friend , a famous server .
And many of the smart people will be infected , and any of the stories that have come from , they will be homeless .
Now this tells the story of a magic film , or a violation of a violation .
What do we get from it ?
But the truth is that activists and powerful people stand in their own pockets , and the more they ought to be taxed , meaning that performance practices like teachers have less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , Gull Watts , this is amazing .
Global media and political leadership are telling us how people are leaving their influence in laser companies that we &apos;re talking about .
I think it &apos;s a cool , chocolate world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these companies work .
I think it &apos;s kind of like a road map .
You can go to another company within a company , a different company within a company , which is almost impossible to figure out who is behind it .
For law enforcement agencies , it &apos;s hard to understand why it &apos;s happening , journalists , schools .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that we haven &apos;t talked about this much in the United States .
Maybe the reason for that is that famous Americans don &apos;t have to be in the census .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in Rome businesses .
That &apos;s why the road companies are doing business , there are only a few Russian-American cities .
I think if we look at the manufacturing of the Khmer Rouge or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the Wall Street Journal , why the U.S.
Instead , many American citizens don &apos;t have to give too much information , they have to give less information to corporate companies than they do in the business card .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
Nine solitary investments make it easy .
This kind of resonance affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf of Votes , we wanted to look at how this machine is being built .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was , we took a league and we sent it to Min &apos;s 13 legal companies .
Our heritage as an African minister wanted to transport the word to America to a home , a ship and a ship .
What was disturbing was that all of the villages gave us a demonstration of how the classroom could move .
These were all early interventions , and we didn &apos;t build our own currency at any rate , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but it got a bad estimate .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individuals who have talked about our hidden revelations and proposals .
It &apos;s not just about a census scientist who &apos;s found in the census .
This is the way the system works , that the tactile system protects television , poverty and inability .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be hard to create these kinds of situations .
It can be hypothetical , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people who are smart and empowered will always be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the company talks about capability .
It was a political issue , but the British Secretary of Defense Commons held in the eight seconds that lived in southern England in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is forming a major global record , whether it &apos;s actually a country or a company in Europe controlling it .
The demonstration is that the E.U. is behind this .
There &apos;s a difference at the edge of the distribution of the law in the center and the center of the network , where we didn &apos;t want it to grow , so we &apos;re five .
We want to look at the inventions , the big breakthroughs , the big breakthroughs used in the world and in the U.N.
This is a moment of change in the Gulf of Venture .
We need to bring the tragedy of the people behind closed doors to shell companies , business leaders .
You know , they speak up , it &apos;s not good for this kind of security business , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to promote change in transparent information .
We can aggregate this security by opening up the secret sauce and the school district .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Like , who &apos;s your invention , has had so much meaning in the last few years of records that have more than all the rest of the world &apos;s media .
Can it be true ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a preconceived notion — isn &apos;t it ? — that global media is showing such poor performance that a small group of workers are able to perform information that is more than all the rest of the world &apos;s media .
CA : How does it happen ?
How do people copy ?
And how do you keep them engaged ?
Julian Sanging : There they are . I can tell you . They are public services in the right way , and we have lots of ways to get the information to us .
That &apos;s why we use a lot of ancient remains to transmit materials from one place to the Internet , to send signs to legal bridges , such as sweeping and blogging .
We get the Information Act , according to the regular Doctor , Remember President or whatever , organizing it like a regular news agency , forcing — which is sometimes very difficult , when you talk about putting massive information into the public and then protecting yourself against legitimate and political candidates .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is real , but you actually never know what the evidence is .
Julian Senging : It &apos;s right , we &apos;re always getting it , and if we get it at a stage , we quickly release the information .
( Gunshot ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of a visionary and wondering what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we look at it up .
So this was Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julian Senging : Yes , this is the coral report .
It was a hidden magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , there was a government , an 18 year-old , Daniel Arpha man .
He was a sleeping dog in Kenya .
And when I came to the power of a book — based on the authoritarian powers who were trying to decide that Kanji was going to go out and buy this report , they bought 20 million pounds of report and one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to fight its political will , which was the smartest man — still the smartest person in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why it was built in 2007 , and we were able to achieve this , first in December 2008 , with the right elections .
When we did that report , we decided three days after the new president , Kabul decided to volunteer with this guy who was horrified by Daniel Arp Maui so that he could download his report and go to the Gulf of Mexico .
CA : And — I mean , I mean , just briefly , it &apos;s — it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by business , but by the mean , it &apos;s transformed the result of your choice .
Julian Senging : Yes . This is the village of Guardian , and then it was distributed throughout all of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he , after a few days , relieved the Kenyan press relief that he could talk about it .
And it was on television for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the votes , according to an online sex report , and it changed the result of the major choice .
CA : Well , did your secret mind really change the world ?
Julian Sangley : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re going to show a little video of a little bicycle tube .
This is a long video , but here &apos;s a little clip .
This is — I &apos;m going to show you a video of a heart attack .
RD : Those are tough , when you reach them , pull them in .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
The street is clean . It &apos;s fine . Gold goes .
When they &apos;re in your shoes , tell me — go away .
Every dollar .
Come on , Galen !
( Mechanical noises ) Gold running . Gold running . ( Mechanical noises ) Gold running .
Hectile — two , six , six , six .
We have to go , time is up !
Okay , we killed eight people now .
Here we see two old hybrids , and we still have the vegetation .
Roger . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two , two , six , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what a contract . What was happening ?
God forbid you , Chuck Eli . All right . Well , I killed them .
CA : So what did it do ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it had a profound effect on it .
We finally brought two people together to do more research .
These were the first three populations that happened in this case .
CA : So 11 people killed in the attack , right ? Two colleagues ?
Julian Sangley : Yeah ! Two rollers of the Royers , two tiny kids were kidnapped .
Twenty-six people disappeared collectively .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of outrage .
What was its primary cause of obesity , what do you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with incredibly unequal power .
On the one hand , some people are going to the street , and then a kilometer away , the aspiration starts to dig at 30 meters of Haitian caffected by anyone — any number — and kill the refugees as babies .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t in any way lazy , because their profession was journalism .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadlyn Meing got arrested , and it said that he had confirmed this video in Rome that he showed you , plus 280,000 and a half American documentaries .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanging : So what we did was we took advantage of the documents .
It was labeled five days ago , where 150,000 documents were received and 50 .
But now we &apos;ve done what they did at the beginning of the year , a documentary of the Reagan White House , but it doesn &apos;t matter in their backyard .
I mean , I used to come into the closet .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of applications for the American safety house ...
Julie Singer : We give them what we do . ( CA : Y &apos;all do it ? ) JO : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) JS : Because this kind of thing shows you that , actually , currently , Arab governments are violating human rights violations in these governments .
If you look at the documents , these types of materials are in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is that right ?
Julian Singer : So the question is , how important information is in the world , what information can &apos;t be made possible .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that organizations spend money on to keep secret , and it &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out , you have hope to do something good , because what organizations know better , and they know the stories inside , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there risks to this individually or collectively parallel societies , where there &apos;s an unexpected way to scream ?
Julian Sanging : We didn &apos;t have the documents with them .
I mean , our big battle is practical .
With information , we can sample the information in a particular way that &apos;s private — the information that &apos;s available to someone .
But there are also some myths — like your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about these civic servants who come and join us .
CA : OK , so they do it with the gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say , for example , is , you think , someone whose daughter is employed in the United States Senate , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had this effect that some people like to hug others .
It shows an American science of dead people .
What this has done — it has shown millions of people around the world that American science is done .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? What are you going to say ?
Julian Senging : So there are many questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch videos , so every day they look at it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to their ranks , it doesn &apos;t make any difference to their perceptions .
Because every day they look at something .
It &apos;s going to change their frame and mindset , which is what we hope for .
CA : OK , so you have a hope for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t you think it &apos;s ridiculous that it would make light , that you would have to have this kind of flexibility in your mind ?
Julian Sanging : Absolutely not . I mean , we &apos;re not different .
We don &apos;t have the kind of secrets that are comprised of other minds .
If they do this , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel spiritual about how they &apos;re going to grow back .
CA : I think , we &apos;ve done the same thing — we &apos;ve done the same thing here with invisible people .
You can also imagine that there will be different kinds of breakthroughs involving leukemia and violins .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or we &apos;re going to create a problem .
What does the hero look like ?
And what are the problems ?
Julian Sangling : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : These are great people , judges , great people .
We &apos;re going to try and do another experiment . The lights are going to show you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is a little old one , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Senging : This is a model of what we do almost every day .
Last year at the end of the year — November , there was a lot of important pieces embedded in the banks , like the cells in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had the report card — which was a great experiment about it — which I was told was that , in fact , there was a whole range of other conservation companies that were trying to get there and they went .
And there was some banal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above this report . It was a very difficult thing for us to do .
We couldn &apos;t predict her because she didn &apos;t know who she wrote and what it was about .
So we were surprised that maybe this was a company that did all this in a competition .
So we took it to the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it seems right to look , but we can &apos;t predict it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the weekend that he wrote , and he wanted to look at the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Look , we want to look at the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it and talk about it .
Who are you talking about ?
Can you show how legally you own it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they brought us what we saw in Scratch with the name of the factory worldwide .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of reimagining and imagining what materials are , and trying to write letters from these people .
CA : All right . So , how do you get the information back from inside the BBC ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re collecting and refining acts like hard steps .
Our disclosure to publishing has been equally clear in the last few months , because we &apos;re improving our buying system because of the rare public waste that we have .
This is the source .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s flourishing , more than our capabilities have attached to us because of our growth , and that means that we have a large number of civic services that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have as many people to prepare and prepare .
CA : So that &apos;s a real problem , essentially , why did journalists &apos; dreams or journalists &apos; dreams ?
Julian Sanging : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very difficult to copy very quickly , because we have to negotiate with the types of materials that we have , so we have to bring them together so that they feel very much like they have to work on the materials of local conservation , and then less sense of business .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools in a child .
Is it right ?
Julian Senging : Yes , my parents were in the business of films and then moving away from the city , so it had these two reasons .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychiatrist , so it &apos;s said that everything together can produce a mental disorder .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a kid and you came up with this idea of working very quickly .
Julian Sangley : So I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist worker from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time when this crime hit me .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian mafia that can browse your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re paying for a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what do you think your core value is ?
Can you tell us something about them , what they are , and perhaps one event in their life that helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in the facts .
But the basic value : good , smart , hard people don &apos;t produce the tools ; they grow their own .
And that &apos;s the lesson I learned from my father and some other brilliant and brilliant people who live in my life .
CA : Brilliant and brilliant people don &apos;t generate megafauna ?
Julian Senging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a dumb man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of growing a mammal that &apos;s close to the police .
And this is something that has been in my career for many , many years .
CA : So for the last time , we just said , what happened in the last year ?
Basically you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you &apos;ve got the newspaper there that &apos;s deeply disturbing the story .
Instead , they inspired your status .
So you &apos;ve been very famous in this country . So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
AIDS is a crisis .
There was the highest above all .
The banks there were 10 times larger than the rest of the economy .
Well , we did that in July last year .
And the state of television was so controversial that five minutes before it was released , as a movie : &quot; &quot; Being at the Department of Defense Discipline , and the state of Niwitzerland was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-lapse all the time , and we &apos;re very famous in the Ice Line , I went to East Land and talked about it .
And those elements of the people there shouldn &apos;t be that again , and as a result , the Soviet Republicans , some of them working with international observers , we offered a different kind of Ice Land law enforcement , so it &apos;s a Freedom Media , one of the most protective places for journalists all over the world , for the new Neal Prizes , for free .
A nation in Northern Ice Land is like a lightning bolt , so it goes up and down in the system .
And just a month ago , the Australian Parliament looked at it in proportion .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , jugglers .
When you look towards the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to happen ?
Julian Senging : I don &apos;t believe that the situation will be there .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to agree with the laws of liberty and the laws of transparency around the world — in Europe , between China and the United States .
What &apos;s the code ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live — because with a small attempt , we can get to one side or another .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating geeks into what they call , geeks , praise , and all the power is for you .
JH : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was very good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is milk .
I spent my childhood circumstances dancing , and I watched these mosquitos pray .
When I was growing up and I came back home in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team broke .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view , I sort of looked at how the rest of the world thought about it .
And wherever I went to the last month , I was amazed that North Carolina , Persia , or Indonesia , reached the valley with four species — all right , silence , cod .
And I thought this was a big bizarre thing , and I was wondering if anybody else ever had this secondary pressure .
And when I went to visit him , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching these Catholic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
There is no unusual human character to confine the natural world into a few elements .
This is what we did 10 thousand years ago when we took our animals apart .
If you look at the fire 10 thousand years ago , you look at it and you look at it and you look at all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back in 2000 , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cotton , zinc and silver .
It &apos;s true for the elderly .
If you look at the mines of New York City about 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see pictures , posters and magazines .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only four years old because you &apos;re going to see dragonflies , cats , but also stars .
I understand that we &apos;re moving towards this .
How did we get here ?
Shire .
This is a brand new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The second great war has given us tremendous excitement to be strong .
During the great war , we developed technologies such as the Soviet Union , the Hawaiian polymers , all of these things .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see a tremendous increase in the capacity of catastrophe .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that fat farms and sea urchins have gone up , and in a couple of years , its origins have gone up , collectively .
Now if you collect forest fishing and forest pollution , it &apos;ll be equivalent to two Chinese marine births every year .
It doesn &apos;t make any sense to use my Chinese coauthor , because China is not just one of the largest megacity countries , it &apos;s also one of the biggest squares .
Now they come to their checkpoints .
First , the U.S. and most of the most utilized ocean-basin-wide food in the West .
Forest lying is a very bad source .
Only one pound of forestry is killing fish , five , 10 , 15 pounds of forestry for the market .
Logging to the marketplace is also incredibly sophisticated .
In a study done in the Digital Universe , it showed that leather is extremely ineffective in carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the forest canopy is the forest canopy .
Now look at these cute little threads .
It puts the footprint of the earth into its place to protect the coast , the clearance of the coast , the yeast and the yeast , all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with civil wars .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years alone putting out millions of volcanoes .
A second procedure that &apos;s here , which philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Naked Neero . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the tape record , and this is very controversial .
Now , there are some things that are already happening that are starting to poke out of the hippocampus , but with it , with very large numbers of ants , they can pool the hippocampus and change the food for the hippocampus .
And many times it &apos;s been written by the slaves that read the word &quot; &quot; Redwoods . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the slime mold that we like to see on the river , which means changing it in fresh food , which means that the ecosystem is opening up and making it fresh .
Later on , there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan equals global warming .
You need to look at large areas of land to organize .
We have a region in which scientists call authenticity Management Management , or ICCAT — the Internet Commission to Protect Attack .
Carl Spencer also put together a great job of finding all the tuna .
We can break fast , but it &apos;s not good enough for the tuna fields .
Not many people know , but too many people do .
He can spend over 40 miles per hour , and the temperature of his body can heat up to 20 degrees C.
All of the information is closed to the last mile .
There &apos;s blood vessels on the floor that don &apos;t last very long .
This is the best protein .
But the forest creature is 40 miles away from the count of houses , and they can &apos;t stay in the forest .
Space has been a good loss , it doesn &apos;t have to be a bad loss .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was running out of service .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every single dot has to be mapped .
In the politics of connectedness , there are over 3,000 of them .
Now , I say there are a lot of people in the connectome — ( Laughter ) if anybody has access to the power of contact , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere there are these streets , these are the streets where peace comes from .
As a result , we have a successful breakthrough for the climate crisis .
When the space shuttle began , it would cost six pounds to build a foundation of peace .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
In contrast , it &apos;s also a small false watch , because if you consider the Freeman Fund , they call peace pound instead of a pound of paper .
While this feedback is thrown at the door .
It &apos;s hard to say something about parallel and parallel .
But it also requires the credit card industry to get the reputation of the milk industry .
This is a system that &apos;s producing cooker food that &apos;s growing on the surface of Titan .
This goes back seven percent a year .
Even though we spend less money on getting a milk to the market , we &apos;ve also got a lot of milk .
We don &apos;t just drink milk , we drink milk and eggs .
We have what &apos;s been baked and we have what &apos;s been baked .
Because on top of it , the blood and the shoes and so on and so forth , the mosquito bites .
I wonder if there &apos;s any jellyfish that has ever opened and yet has been erased .
India was the first or the first to die — ( Laughter ) as a result , it was a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of wildflowers that are being taken out of the ocean .
It &apos;s equal to the third part of China or the number of people in the United States who get out of the ocean every year .
The last thing in four states is this .
Philadelphia actually started as an elevator .
And it started with a local manufacturer who saw that the weekend never came to Microsoft .
He got on the radio and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Take the lead .
What the scenario would have been more likely to open up for the ocean was a demonstration that Ebola does not die .
So he built his own liposuction scenario .
Unfortunately , the pendulum came in at 30 cents .
He wanted to make a 25-cent census , so he brought in the electronic code .
Actually , Philadelphia Sandwich Alaska is the largest mass-industry in the United States of Arts , moving from two to three billion pounds of maze every year .
If we finish the pollution , the current option may be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
This changes the plant proteins in a very dynamic way in the animal kingdom , and this makes sense for the third world .
Actually , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; in nine months , it &apos;s an adult .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a dirty vegetable .
There &apos;s no epidemic of AIDS and AIDS epidemics that we think it &apos;s going to keep us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , it &apos;s about the poor millennials .
That represents a large portion of three million tons .
A chance for conservation workers to ask , can we eat it ?
Can we choose not to give them peace ?
There are reasons for that .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , a typical part of the distribution against lying , and the effect is at the top of the Indus Valley .
This is amongst the top three , EPA and DIY .
So this is her ability .
But what if we took this path and instead of just picking up a few dollars &apos; worth of pounds or picking up the road and turning it into a feedback loop , can we crop the leather and clean the way we spend more money ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
There &apos;s so much EPAA and DDIY as well .
It &apos;s extremely efficient in computing .
The revenue of Indonesia to the market is only three parts .
Actually , it comes out of three places that don &apos;t come from milk .
The ocean creates three vertical axis in the middle , so they only collect them .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue garage , it &apos;s been shaped by the use of Facebook and nanotraphy .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , which is why the oceans die so much .
As you can think about the files , in all these different components , there are more than three protons and more , they &apos;re highly effective .
This is absolutely true .
And the last mile is a question mark .
We can create a pattern that can be proven useful for ocean protein .
This creature should be green , has its own ability to grow and change very quickly , and it has its own capabilities , and it wants to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Pete Ice .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about it , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can do this .
But try to do something about it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we could do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million people in the ocean .
I mean , this is all happening .
We want to do without understanding our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s going to be a little bit negative .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was there to reveal the big brain because I have a brother who is dealing with mental illness .
More and later , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I could combine my dreams with my reality and make my dreams better ?
What is it about my brother &apos;s brain and Scandinavia that they do not combine their dreams with the universal and the universal reality , and they act on it .
So I quit my life to study serious illness .
And I moved from India to Boston , where I worked for Dr. Frankenstein &apos;s Bank on a field trip to Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in the biological surface of these people &apos;s brains that are generally conceived as compared to their brains of people who are in Scottsville or Hawaiian Drew ? So what we &apos;re actually trying to do is make a map of the electrochemistry of the brain , where are the cells communicating with the chemistry , and how much are they doing with it ?
So I had a lot of pride in my life because I was doing this kind of research on the day , but at four o &apos;clock in the weekends , I was traveling as a result of these NAMI miles .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I was asked to find out that I was faced with a mental disorder myself .
The left side of my brain was a nine strokes .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely disappear from the ability to understand information .
I was able to read and write and remember things in the morning in the morning .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you ever look at the same brain , there are two parts of it that are vastly different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the part of the brain where the arm is touched with the left part of the brain , and this will be held in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are very , very different from one another .
Those of you who think that computers work like a parallel processor in the right part of our brain , while the left part of our brain acts like a series processor .
These two parts are transferring messages to each other through the culture of the corn that some 300 volunteers have .
But it &apos;s also two parts of the world .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part has to understand information in a totally different way , and their minds are on different things , and if you allow them , I think their personalities are very different from each other .
It &apos;s going to be okay . Thank you very much .
Moderator : Yeah , a lot more .
( Laughter ) The evidence of our brains is just now and we think about this moment .
Right now , we &apos;re thinking about images of our brains in a large part of the brain that are orchestrated by the movements of our bodies .
Information is being embedded in the form of energy , it &apos;s being embedded in the body , it &apos;s being embedded in all of our systems , and then it &apos;s transformed into a giant aluminum class that we see in the present moment how we feel and how we feel in the mind and how we feel .
I am an energy bound by the energy that &apos;s surrounded by the right part of the brain .
We &apos;re using energy from one another to be aware of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And here we are , the brothers of the planet who are driven to make the world a better place .
And at this point , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left-hand part of our brain is thinking scientifically and theoretically .
The left part of our brain is about space and future .
The building on the left side of the brain is such that we are now beginning to collect some of our greatest alumni / Class , and then start to collect explanations .
And it &apos;s also organizing and guiding all of this information that &apos;s going on in the past , all of these things that we &apos;ve ever learned , and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely the effects of our projects .
The left part of our brain is thinking about language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that keeps us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a tiny little voice that tells me , but keep in mind that you can buy and go home .
I need them in the morning , it &apos;s the awareness of reading my computational book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , I ! I am !
And as my left brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become very compassionate .
I &apos;m the only person in the room who has access to tremendous energy surrounded by me and with you .
And that particular part of my brain took place this morning in the afternoon .
On the morning of the year I had my left eye in the back of my eye with a stick of pain .
It was the kind of cold pain that comes from looking at the ice cream .
And it hurt me like I was struck and I left .
And then he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary . I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Nothing , I start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I walked around and I looked at my cardboard cardboard cardboard , which is the first physical exercise machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and I feel like I have a hand that &apos;s sort of like the fifth of a primitive person that &apos;s been touched by the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel so weird and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being on the device , but now I &apos;m in a mysterious and mysterious place where my consciousness is conscious of the experience
And it was all very strange and poor , and my head was growing up .
So I got out of the machine , and I started to roll in the room , and I felt that everything in my body was fine .
And everybody understands very , very hard .
I have no connection in my speed , and I think there &apos;s a home appointment , and my focus is just on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my closet ready to be underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , oh my God , I need you to play now .
Here &apos;s my foot going down , and then my balance is not going down , I &apos;m pulling up and down the wall .
I smile and look at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t organize my body &apos;s waste .
I didn &apos;t understand where I started and where I ended because my hands were held together by atoms and microwalls .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the left part of my brain was completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice on a regular computer controller .
One bag of chips .
Before that , I was surprised by the rags inside my brain .
But then immediately , the energy came into the context of this magnificent atmosphere around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limitations of my body now , I felt enormous grief and powerful .
I felt part of the energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came to my left brain and he said to me , &quot; Look , you &apos;re in trouble . &quot;
We want to help him , and I told myself , I &apos;m really sick of a problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really sick of a problem , but I came back to the same consciousness that I say for a lot of money .
But they were beautiful places .
Consider how beautiful it will be where you will be completely dependent upon this tiny brain that is close to the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my work and I &apos;m getting pushed back against it .
I felt so much shame in my body .
And measure all of your relationships outside the world , and any of them have been degraded .
And I felt a sense of peace .
And measure what it would look like if you were left with this 70-year-old emotional weight that you put on .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a mess .
It was beautiful .
And then the left side of my brain went , and he said , hey , there &apos;s two hemispheres .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking , should I be helpful with this , so I got out of the closet and I walked away from the closet , and I walked away from my apartment , and now I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment my teacher completely passes away .
And it occurred to me that , hey , my God is going to attack me , the other thing my mind tells me is , how great !
( Laughter ) How awesome !
I &apos;m going to be some brain researchers who have the opportunity to realize that they can witness their own brains and that they can go inside — ( Laughter ) — and then one day they come into my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman — ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; All right , I can &apos;t get rid of the golf course , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll return to my normal range . Okay .
I need to call my assistant . I need to call my work . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my first job , and then I remembered that I had my own business card with my phone number .
Then I go into my studio and I open up a three-story motorcycle card .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eye what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s not because I don &apos;t look at the dots .
And the slope of the word is curved by the marks of the paper and the markers , and I &apos;m not learning anything .
And then I started waiting for him to describe what I &apos;m saying .
And at that moment , the normal retrieval of the truth , and I learned that it &apos;s not a card ; it &apos;s not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to do just one inch .
And during that time , the effects of the cold on the left were increasing in the 45 minutes .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I have no way .
So I &apos;m taking the phone and putting it here .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the phone , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards .
But then I switch to my own half-mile length when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I had that number that I didn &apos;t have .
So I grabbed my fucking arm like a giant and I stood on the sidewalk , and I pressed the two buttons out of my hand , and when I came back to the normal truth , I could tell you that I was there before , and finally I left all of India , and I heard that on my phone , one of my colleagues called me and said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And
And I say to him , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking about men . I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice is kind of &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; My God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then he goes , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I can &apos;t speak and understand any language until I try .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And a little bit later , four months later in one of the ambulances , one of the ambulances was running out of Boston to another mosque department .
I walked up and looked like children of tiny feet .
Just like the one story that keeps the girl and keeps getting out of the poor , I pulled the energy out and felt the feeling of shame .
And it occurred to me at that moment that I &apos;m not restricted to my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or a second time of my transition .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I was alive .
When I felt the ghost in my soul , I gave life to God .
Now my brain was ticking out two different facts .
At that time , my emotional system started to drive me from feeling suffocated by pain .
Light raised my brain like the fire in the forest , and the veins were so close and so strong that I could barely understand a voice from the background , or from the sight of the forest , and I was barely scratching my way .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body &apos;s representation , so I felt enormous and wide like a person who had been liberated from my boss .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great storm wave spreading out across the ocean .
Great neuron .
I had the quality of being a privilege .
And I remember thinking , this could never possibly be possible , that I could find my own great appreciation of being in such a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been paralyzed .
And if I &apos;m nervous , and I &apos;m still alive , whatever life is capable of getting nerves , and I &apos;ve seen a world filled with people who are beautiful , fresh , comfortable and loving , who know they can feel this character at any time .
And they can choose between John and John that he wants to take his book to the left side of his brain and take his own steps in search of this paradigm .
And then I understood how great this experience could be . &quot; &quot; It was the lesson of the message that taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After the earthquake of the cold , the southquake pulled the blood out of my brain equivalent to a cloud of blood that was punctuated by the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with a mother who is a real visitor in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of quantum life , the power of hand skills and two extremely accurate brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can step in the right part of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
50 Earth-like cells are made of beauty from molecular marrow cells , one that &apos;s all there .
Or I can choose to step on the left side of my consciousness where I become an individual in a trivial manner .
Quantum fluctuations .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
Who would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And when ?
I think as long as we spend our right-brained electricity on the right-hand corner of the brain , we will increase the world &apos;s peace and our planet will be so protective .
And I thought , well , we need to replicate this idea .
Thank you .

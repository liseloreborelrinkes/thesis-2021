It became good !
Are you people around ?
They called my name Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , as a young boy , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and I was eating .
So I asked myself , would you like to sing in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , and he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Syria ? ( In English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The vocabulary of singers , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minneo , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minneo . &quot; &quot; Is France the right word ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; He said .
He was speaking to me , as he was telling himself to me , &quot; If this were the world &apos;s final girl , I would also look at her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young girl named after two words placed a girl on her back and forth .
How does he speak that way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got tired of it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s wrong with me talking about my country ?
Where does this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I &apos;m like a lot of people , who come to die in their lives , where instinctively they break everything that happens in their lives , just because they can say goodbye and they have fun .
Should I be bringing my whole culture , my imagination , my mind and others ?
We may have the most important battle savings in the stories of children .
Do they want me to give all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What makes sense ?
Although , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision about it as much as what it was for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or research , or language that we use in the universities , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we share when we work on a curriculum project , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the U.N.
If we do that , then they will follow our document .
So where do I take it ? We can ask all of these questions !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But another more important fact that we should think about .
Arabic is a mother tongue .
Research says that in other languages , you need to transcend your mother tongue .
In other languages , the teaching of the mother tongue is essential .
How ?
Gabriel Gabrian , when he first started writing , he exploded Arabic .
All of their imaginations , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in the villages where she grew up , felt a special joy , felt a special voice , and thought about a special thought .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn their English literature , you feel the same joy , you feel the same sense .
You can imagine that in English they are also the authorities of the English language , of this little boy who was sitting in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that nobody can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill one , the only way to kill one is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are emerging .
Germany , France , Japan and China are all standing up .
That &apos;s because they make laws to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s because they &apos;re using it in the portfolio , they &apos;re investing a lot of money on prevention .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset is not yet up to us , and we want to move to this emerging world .
They were the countries that were the same as ours at a time , but the decision to try to grow , to study , to go to those countries , such as Telecom , Education and so on , was leaving her tongue with herself as she was leaving the schools — as a miracle .
They brought it close to home .
Because if you go to the textbooks or the textbooks and the textbooks on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be included in these categories , not standing up , like we are most of the time .
So in order to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
Call it , color , whatever .
Languages are not just for conversation ; words are just for us .
Language is a sign of the specific stages in our lives , and the words that tell us about our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special sphere in your brain , a special feeling for a specific day in history .
Language is not the name of taking one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal notion of what we think , how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our brain ?
How would you not understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the Freedom of English ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;m going to go ahead and spend time talking about it .
The point is that this effect reminds us of a particular thing .
A friend of mine is a French police officer , who &apos;s a French poet .
Once upon a time , he was asked what was going on .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I tried to elaborate and translate it one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Through four women , he called it &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then every night he tried to understand it .
And he was thinking , how can a good thing be ?
Do they want to self-identify ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t think of his wife as meaning this word , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; the way he thinks about it is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , with me , gave me a breakthrough , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I felt as I was committing to Freedom . &quot; &quot; The fourth woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And soon she said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I hold your hand and I hold
He translated . He showed me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We changed it in a way for the society , and we started the Arab Spring process .
As many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Get yourself a mask . Get yourself a mask . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The curator of the Arabic dictionary received a message , which is , &quot; I speak to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept this . You spoke in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because , like , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I &apos;m tired of Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be confident in the way that our desires , our desires and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the same as ours and the same as ours .
So this quote , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the East , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; And then he sat down .
Very easy , but exciting and powerful .
After that , we started another monkey with the landscape of the orbit .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , a view in which the letter black and the blue tips are in the halls of the description , &quot; Make language murder . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we would have to sign up for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to look for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to go back .
And it &apos;s a lot of fun to play with .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls before the Arab Spring .
Cole images of girls and girls .
We &apos;re a lot of people !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Huh ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve described the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what they want to suggest , but I &apos;ve got a word for it that &apos;s good and it &apos;s true .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not funny ! We shouldn &apos;t help you .
But to get to that point , we all need to say that we &apos;re not going to give anyone permission or to think that our language has an option above us , to present to us , to present to us , to preserve our patients and to think about it .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach a cell or not refine a stick or something , we can still be creative .
At that time , every one of you is a creative project .
You have to create in Mother Nature .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global scale .
He can re-branch Arabs first .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we &apos;re going to have to know that , and we have to say that the solution is there , part of the solution .
Finally , what can you do today ?
How many of you are Twitter ?
In Arabic , I recommend you , though , my time is up , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the numbers , by the way , don &apos;t write Arabic .
( Applause ) It &apos;s remarkable ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a computational language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to demonstrate the need for language conservation .
Now I tell you a secret .
A child describes the language of her father for the first time .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , huh . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , honey . &quot; &quot; And I promised my daughter to light that in the marketplace , if she would say to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you Arabic . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot; I
And it &apos;s not going to be predicted that no one &apos;s going to get old . ( Applause ) Take a break from this cultural press . ( Applause )
I &apos;m telling you in ancient English that it is us to remind us that our situation is not a miracle , that I was the one who was protecting my people , until you saw my generation not to bank us , and I was devoted to this generation of inequality , not to tell our generation not to be invited to the presence of our generation , not to the presence of deaths , where our
( Applause )
My favorite statistic is the data .
In college , my primary office was a gardener , which meant I had written a lot of documents .
Now a normal person when they write something , something like this happens .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to start the work a little bit slower , but the first week they do a lot of work and after the most work , everything &apos;s done , and it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I also want to do it this way .
My approach would be this .
I &apos;m going to do all kinds of things , but the actual work of the literature is going to start on the bottom , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every literature .
And then came up with a whole bunch of pages of research papers , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my common collaborator was not funded to deal with this .
It was a huge job .
I set up the plan , and I decided that I would do something like this .
This is going to be a little bit like this .
I &apos;m going to start with the big work , the middle ages , the speed of the work up , and eventually I &apos;m going to zoom in and zoom out like a student .
How hard can it be to learn ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Go and get lost , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we built a big project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then he would get nervous , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months were changed in a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went out one day and I spent three days in the DVD , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 seconds , and I spent 90 pages , two orders of magnitude , and I didn &apos;t have to send people two letters — the first time in the campus , spent time at the speed , and the DVD was done .
I thought , now it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you going to be Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk about his dad . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;m going to look at him today , that &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was a very talent . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be friendly by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very good .
Well , I &apos;m writing a book today .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about it .
My routine offers six people to drink all the time , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain of people and why we are .
Now my premise was that the brain of the simple people differences between six people .
Understanding that I had developed a liver where I could examine the brains of others as well as the brain of the chest , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look away and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a schoolteacher , that &apos;s not very fashionable , but consider it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
In both of these brains there &apos;s a decisive decision , but the brain of the human brain is entertaining .
Now what does this mean in a simple way ?
That means , it &apos;s okay until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work is the best time to complete . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; &#91; A wise human being will decide to make meaning meaningful , but he doesn &apos;t like the project , so he takes the word , and he says , &quot; &quot; Look at the page of the Children &apos;s Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; And he forgets about the Science of the Torah , because I know it &apos;s happening .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;re going to go to the pub , and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After this , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , which will start to talk about the intersection of Richard &apos;s art , and many days later it will be over to watch the protesters as the master of the Bears .
( Laughter ) It will take some time for all of these things , so there won &apos;t be any time for it to do today .
How are you going to fight ? ( Susan ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the source of compassion that you want to say .
It just wants to live in an existing space .
It has no perspective for the future , only two things : human beings and compassion .
In the animal world , it &apos;s all fine .
If you know how many of you and you spend your entire life going forward , you &apos;re pretty successful .
( Laughter ) And for creation , human beings are a generation .
Good nutrition , good thought , and increased generation , tribes often get this way .
But if you haven &apos;t done that , the tribe is not too far .
We &apos;re an increasing educator , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting away from it .
We &apos;re building big projects .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And we only want to be able to do what we want to do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes the guards seem to be suited to do what is easier and easier to eat , to eat , to eat , to eat , to eat , to eat , to eat .
So there &apos;s a catch .
Sometimes they agree .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And that &apos;s the argument .
And for the most basic people , this tension always leads to an end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet corner , a very simple and consistent way that reasons outside the circle .
I call it a magical place .
( Laughter ) The dark matter is the place where the elite people are standing right .
There &apos;s an absolute moment when obligation shouldn &apos;t be romantic .
In the dark areas that most of you are probably not happy , because they &apos;re not right , spatial awareness , fear , anxiety , and self-suffering are all the qualities that go right .
The question is , in this case , when the solution is solved , how do the simple human beings bump into the Blue Zone , which is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that systems also provide governance , which protect them every time in their logical spaces — somebody tells him to lie .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly Russian , but when David Lynn gets closer , it becomes clear , or then when people are at risk of colonialism , employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that it just flows through this .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months earlier TEDsters contacted me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I &apos;ve been there .
Last night at TED I had my dream .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my jittery and my jittery , something else was going on in the brains of decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; Did you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on this . He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at India &apos;s crossing at the bottom 200 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So this day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , a month later , people at TED decided to sign the names of Congress .
I downloaded the Web and it was my photograph of me holding onto it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house that got awake , and within seconds the whole system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the house , and he wandered around the tree .
And finally , and finally , a religious decision-maker took a bite and I could start talking .
Now , the House of Representatives showed a cross-section of each department , like me , someone like me would spend two weeks trying to figure out what to do , and then suddenly the unbelievable supply chain is to go to sleep every night and write an article .
And the three-letter holders in this case call the Sistine People &apos;s System .
That &apos;s pretty good . Nobody &apos;s working .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the impact on this .
I actually have thousands of miles of access , all over the world and all sorts of people , from all kinds of things .
They included narcissists , bankers , engineers , penetrants , and also broadband PDs .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody was saying one thing and saying , &quot; I &apos;m in trouble too . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and letters of email addresses .
In the tradition of these people , there was a mystery in the script that wrote how hard he spoke in his life , in terms of what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are they all in America ?
It turns out that the Sys Admin has two parts .
Today , for example , I gave talks about subjects , all of them listened .
And when David is lying , the effects of recent years have been the culprits because of the houses where he lies .
But the system is a second part of it , and it &apos;s not about any David Laun .
So if you want a project like this that you start yourself with , like some arts or businesses — like some arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start paying attention to the vehicle , to do something about it .
In addition to the projects , there are many other things that David Lunne and I don &apos;t have to struggle with , like being in your family , exercising , thinking about your health , thinking about your relationships , telling your relationships well enough to tell who &apos;s not running .
Now if the only way to do the job is to do the job of the regular check , it &apos;s difficult , because all of these data is to create the conditions , the lynchings that are lost .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The good news is that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with your dad .
And this is the typical feature of a department which is very little to see and much less to do with respect to critical mass destruction .
You &apos;re getting better at information and good news .
And this can become a metaphor for the long-term stewardship .
So I thought it was because of their email , and they &apos;re in trouble .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban recruited them , sometimes in their lives .
Disability is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot afford them .
I studied all email and one thing that showed — I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think you &apos;re all easy .
It may not be a particularly complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and probably some of the DVDs in the Upper are good , but remember the capabilities when David Lawson doesn &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Kandler of life .
Every block represents a week , this is the nine year environment .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them are recovered .
I think we all need to have a brand new place for this .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the business , because in every single life there &apos;s no time that &apos;s ever been done .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s essential for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have a single house there , probably we should start right now .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days in the U.S. and Afghanistan refugee campaign , a group of eight-day Iraqi veterans were isolated from a region of Afghanistan , and they were isolated from a region of Afghanistan to help to provide an enforcement of the Afghan government to help a security officer to help a security officer , to help a security official in the Afghan government
He came in on the side of a campaign , and he was home on three sides , and with all kinds of things , he watched Captain Switzerland as a kid , and he watched Captain Switzerland as a kid , and he watched as a kid come over to the campaign to save the victims and save the dead .
One of the other surgeons of the parents , one of the other passive medical advisers , was moving to a helicopter , and he and one of the other passive medical advisers was moving to a helicopter .
It &apos;s shown that the Copenhagen and the Pacific has gone through this greenhouse gases of greenhouse gases .
They put it into helicopter after helicopter and then you see what happens when Captain Switzerland is building and then they put it back before they can save others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary motivations when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a loving one , and I knew why I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , you get people who are willing to reconcile themselves in order to benefit others .
In business , we are bringing people who are willing to partner with each other in order to benefit us .
We &apos;ve got Italy here !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that these are the best people .
That &apos;s why they grow up looking after the waves .
These are the best people on the brink of services , and these are the best people on the brink of services .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is happening , and if you &apos;re in a leading environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , then each of us has the ability to meet and work together and increase the ability to do that in others .
I have the great privilege of bringing together people like this today — ( Applause ) — to tell me something that I have the most important privilege of bringing together people like this today — ( Applause ) — who have given yourself and your knowledge to save other people , and I asked myself , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The difficulty with perception of trust and collaboration is that it &apos;s motivating , not accidents .
You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Give me a hand . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I connect the two people together and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s a trick .
So where does it come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to paper , which is the earliest remoteness of Homo sapiens , we see that the world is full of dangers , all of those forces are deeply focused on us .
Nothing is legal .
Hope can be a lack of resources , a lack of fluid dynamics , but it &apos;s all about bringing all of this together to reduce the duration of our lives .
And so we flew in the form of social animals where we &apos;re sitting together and doing work that I call a part of compassion , like a tribe where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt preserved ourselves , it was a sensitivity and collaboration .
It has autonomous benefits .
It means that I can wake up at night and I can walk through the door and see some dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m not passing you over , it means you &apos;re not going to look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a good system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
This world is driven by the dangers of things that are trying to make our lives difficult or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success situation .
These societies can scale beyond trust markets .
It can be a new technology that will take your business class away one night , and it can be a new technology that will take your business class off at night .
Or it can even counter you , which sometimes you try to exercise .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of businesses , but at least it &apos;s trying to get your ups and try to get your businesses to drink you up , and it &apos;s trying to get your ups and your businesses to drink you up .
We have no choice of those power .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it will never be done .
The only driver of change is conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where the value comes from , because that &apos;s what drives the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to justify their well-being and well-being outcomes to people , and that is to justify their dignity and their well-being , to feel protected and to feel protected , to feel the intimate relation@@
I was on a vacuum trip , and I illustrated a fact that when a journey that I tried to walk before he tried to find it , and I watched the workers on the front door just as it passed the law as it passed .
The first time I tried to fight it , the first time I tried to fight it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do we have machines like this ?
Why can &apos;t you work with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason why we love to travel to the West Bank is not because they rank the LGBT people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give to their leaders .
You see , if conditions are constrained , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and our strength protecting yourself from one another and therefore reduce organization .
What a great leader can show is that the nearest example of how a parent is going to be a good leader for her , the nearest example of how a parent is going to be .
If you think about how a good parent is going to be , what do you want ? What does it do ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , systems and regulation , when they &apos;re needed , we want to give our children the opportunity , education , systems and regulation , when they &apos;re needed , they want to give them more and more of what we can do for themselves , so that they can grow and do more of what we can for ourselves .
Good leaders want that .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , systems and order , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunity , education , systems and order , when they need it , they want to create self-confidence , they want to create confidence , they want to create permission , so that they can achieve the greatest successes that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve the greatest successes that we &apos;ve
Charlie Kim , who is the CEO of a tech firm in New York City called Next Jump , is the CEO of a tech firm in New York City called Next Jump , and they say , &quot; &quot; If your family &apos;s hard time , do you ever save your child ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people out of our organization ? How do we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie has given rise to the power of resurrection , and Charlie has given rise to the power of resurrection .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you &apos;re not engaged in effective problems .
But if you have a problem , they &apos;ll introduce you and help you , just like we &apos;ll do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s totally different .
The reason that people are so generous and stupid , some bankers are driven by CEOs , is because there are so many people who are very generous and stupid , some bankers from CEOs , and that &apos;s because people are so generous and stupid , some bankers are driven by CEOs , who are unequally stressed and motivated .
It &apos;s not about data .
They &apos;ve also founded the key principles of value .
They have grown a civil society .
We know that they &apos;ve given risks to their own children , and we know that they &apos;ve given risks to their own children , but they &apos;ve also given risks to their own children , rather than that they &apos;ve offered their own children to their own children , rather than that they have convinced their own children to their own children .
That &apos;s what gives us no data .
Can anyone get the land to save the Gando for 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
A good leader will never give the data to the children .
A good leader will never give the data to the children .
They &apos;ll give people the skin data to save , but they &apos;ll give people the skin data to save .
Bob Chapman is running a micro-finance company in the Pope Chapping Media , and they &apos;re running a micro-finance company called Barry-Wehmiller in 2008 , and they &apos;re running the largest store , and they &apos;re turning 30 percent of their traffic lights on the GreenLab night .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy more goods .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , and so many of the companies that came in were members of the supply chain and did a terrible job .
And Bob answered that .
You see , the Bush administration does not believe in the code .
But the Bush administration believes in keeping blood , and reducing deaths is much harder and harder to reduce deaths .
And then they made a professional plan .
That every staff , every staff , every staff , every CEO , needed to take care of the four weeks without permission .
They could always do it when they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But as Bob declared the program , he seemed very important .
He said it &apos;s better to get us all the tiny little bits because some of us take far more risks and get paid like this .
That &apos;s how they spent 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you can expect , when people feel maintained by the value of an organization , then trust and cooperation is perceived .
And basically , like no one expected , people started trading off each other .
What was more successful was they traded with less successful families .
Something called a five-hour license to get someone else to license another three .
Calculus is a choice , not a choice .
I know a lot of people who are the most successful of organizations , and I know a lot of people who are the most successful of organizations whose leaders are not exactly the leaders .
They &apos;re absolute warriors and we do what they say because they have a choice but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who have no choice but to be a real leader , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the other side of the person , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the other side of the person , and they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the right side of the person , and they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the right side of the person .
This is a laser .
I heard a story about some of the science that was going on out in the theater and just like the way the geologists are eating at at the end of the day , and they &apos;re playing their people first , and when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re not saving anything for it .
And when he returned to the field , his neighbors gave him some play in his grave so he could play because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
We tell them that they start .
We call them the leaders because they &apos;re funding someone else &apos;s first danger , we call them the leaders because they &apos;re funding someone else &apos;s first danger .
We call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can be preserved , we call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can be preserved and so that people can benefit us , and when we do so , the potential is that our people will be compassionate .
They &apos;ll give us their blood , their fat and their fat to see that the dream of their leaders becomes real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your blood and your nose to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do it for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all love to do ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all love to do ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we all love to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the story of the Limpopo , which is true of the Limpopo and the Mumbai .
Where water and algae are so unbelievable , such as seasons , and growing up in these conditions , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up once at the age of 17 , I was staying with friends in a fashion shop .
The salt in the season is very warm .
And as I was walking around in the lobby , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you invent something that &apos;s just on your skin and you don &apos;t have to clean up ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I &apos;m buying this stuff . &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did some research , and I got some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-four of them are in Africa , and only half are in South Africa .
Different diseases commit suicide to the neighborhood of which the most dangerous tragedy is called trauma .
Trachoma is one of the most independent revolutions that happens because of the loss of the eye , because you can be independent .
This disease is delivered independently to six million people every year , and the most interesting thing is that for the children of the trichoma , you only have to give up your mother : no grandmother , no gold , no English .
After seeing these thoughts and figures , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and I don &apos;t want to mess with it , but I &apos;m doing it for less because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I went to my brother &apos;s 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have the laptop , I didn &apos;t have the Internet for 20 seconds , and I went to Google , and I
And I looked at this as a private issue of fractals .
So Jesus is right , our pheromone has gone .
Now we need to be able to make that happen .
Four years later , the mobile phone — 40 pages long after I &apos;m on the phone writing my patent , I &apos;m the tiniest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Now and Miss ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say more about that . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first exchange pollution .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to waste it .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and in limited means , which I had , Dean University went into some new people , did more of it , and now we have a full-blown broadcasting platform that &apos;s ready for the market , and now it &apos;s ready for the market .
We &apos;ve learned already about DryBath commercialization and people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at large .
They &apos;re just selling under the need . One person at Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; they buy a ticket because that &apos;s how much more content it is .
So we packed DryBath in these creative courses .
You put it between it and you blow it away .
And the cool thing is , one tenth of a button is just five .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about the efficiency of manufacturing .
We want DriBath to be here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Less than once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever they break down and we can save two houses for children , which are in rural areas , two houses , more for school than two houses , two more houses for the children .
After seeing the global impact , we &apos;ve taken our priority guidelines , health and solidarity .
DryBath is a prominent human being and a protector of a poor person &apos;s life .
This project is in the process , now we &apos;re actually in the vicinity of a multinational brand that can be sold in the retail market , and one question that I &apos;m asking for today &apos;s audiences , on the Limpopo Railway , for a week , to describe a 50th anniversary of the Indus civilization that doesn &apos;t have to ruin the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet , I haven &apos;t done it yet .
And one more important thing is that I learned a lot from this early operation , last year Google was introducing me to the world &apos;s greatest youth .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest professor of science at the time , the first African entrepreneur to come up with this account , and one thing that really surprised me , which all of this talk did not want to bribe about . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the results today that I &apos;m going to share with you , and I &apos;m going to be surprised to myself what are the key features of management &apos;s success , which are actually causing the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal goods and organize them at the beginning , you will be left to the edges of human capabilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them possible .
But if initial management is the best , why does a majority of it work ?
So I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know that eventually the most important thing for success .
I wanted to know so many organizations about this , I wanted to take inspiration from many of my most radical ideas and misconceptions that had brought me all the way back to some of the organizations .
I wanted to know this because at the age of 12 , I started a variety of different businesses at the age of 12 , starting with the Kinderabad at the Hyderabad High School , all the way to school when I built a solar power machine , then school , when I built a radio .
When I was out of college , I started a foundation for Safety magazine .
And 20 years ago , the beginning of the Library of India , in the last 20 years , we launched more than 100 companies , and very big successes .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to look at these factors for the greatest cause of management success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I named my company &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; — the oldest moment you feel about it .
With climbing , I thought the leading team , the ability to perceive harm or harm , are also more important factors .
I &apos;d never thought I &apos;d be speaking at TED about mechanics , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone is a project when I don &apos;t have a mom . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
As a team leads , it &apos;s important to empower the passion to learn from the vehicle .
Cooking is a reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at the business model .
Is management a clear operation on aid ?
With that , it seemed to emphasize to me that the most important thing for success is the most important thing .
So think about new investment .
Sometimes governments make a huge investment .
Maybe it &apos;s the most important one ?
After this , right ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world was not good for it ?
It &apos;s serious , so you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or is it too late , and is it too late first ?
So I &apos;ve gone from a lot of detail to a lot of organizations .
And the idea was to set up 100 companies in Libya , and 100 of them outside management to achieve some scientific result .
So first of these ideas , first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Good , NetZero , Tickets.com. — they &apos;re all dollars &apos; worth of performance .
And the bottom five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we were hopeful , but not successful .
And then I tried to put all these qualities into perspective , like I think these companies were introducing these names .
And then in the projects outside Libya , I saw weird successes , like Airbnb , Instagram , Uber , YouTube , LinkedIn .
Here &apos;s some successes : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
They were highly invested in NGOs , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to figure out , but the most important factor was the success and success of all these companies , and the result struck me .
The first thing was choosing time .
Forty-two percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other end of the spectrum , and then the idea , being different , being individual , is really the third multiplication .
But it &apos;s not really clear , it &apos;s not that the thought doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was amazed that the thought doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my understanding .
I think the business model is too late , because you can start a business model without a business model , and then when you &apos;re growing in coffee houses you include it .
And investment , if initially it &apos;s less investment , but now we &apos;re growing , especially today , investment opportunities are very easy .
I &apos;d like to give you a few examples here of all of these notes .
Take the big success of Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of venture capitalists looked at this because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put some of your houses on the grocery store ?
Indeed , it has been false .
One of the reasons the success of the mosquito is because of the best market growth , thought , and market thinking is time-lapse .
This company came in front of the financial problem when people needed additional support , and it made sure that they helped people respond to the proposition of putting a banana in their home .
That &apos;s Uber &apos;s business .
Uber came together , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
But the time was absolutely right to make the money they needed .
Dreaders were also aspiring for additional help ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to look more closely at supplies than at supplies .
We thought it was a great idea , but really , the right time was a lot more .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . With a lot of excitement and a lot of great entrepreneurial growth and a lot of great leadership , we had to work with the Himalayas .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband Internet was much lower .
Anonymous videos were very difficult to see , you had to program in your browser and don &apos;t know what to do , and eventually this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with the Adobe Flash was solved and the Broadband in America grew by over 50 percent , YouTube got the best time .
Incredible , wonderful time .
It turns out that when YouTube started , there was no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But she was the absolute best of time .
So in short , I would say that perception is really important .
Think is very important .
But maybe the choice of time is important .
And the best way to justify time is to see if there are really bad rays to protect you .
And the truth of certainty is that , when you look at the results , I don &apos;t regret them , because if something you like , you want to watch it tomorrow , but in the process of timing , you have to work very safely .
As I said before , institutions can change the world , they can create a better place .
I hope some of them will be helpful at increasing your success , and then that &apos;s not going to be the other way around .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best listeners .

&#91; &quot; &quot; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the greatest data in history . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Encyclopedia edia destroyed well-being and energy people . &#93; &#91; Extreme numbers are dropped in non-state companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve invaded the repertoire of Gallup Walters to convey the greatest revolution in history . &#93; &#91; This week
Since then , hardly any of these advertisements have been debated by secret weapons from small companies .
We tell ourselves the inner stories of villages , banks and villages that come after mosaic partners and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a big company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see the email , you can see the messages , you can see the way you do it , how they work .
It &apos;s beginning to show up .
The OECD is the greatest institution .
We also have the news that the polio eradication companies are the polio eradication companies .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of Russian leadership comes to my daughter in her childhood friend , who is a famous Sistine .
And a lot of smart people are going to be polluted , and the ones that are coming back are going to be the ones that are going to be fighting the more innocent offices .
Now , this tells the story of a magic film , or the story of Jane Jesus Christ , who came to me .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that agrarians and energy are staying in place with their messages , and what they shouldn &apos;t be giving them taxes , meaning that efficient actions like teachers are underpaid for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , Golan Watts , this is amazing .
Worldwide media and political leadership are talking about how people in Russian companies frame their evidence that we &apos;re discovering with our opinions .
I think for people , this is the ugly , fragmented world , and it &apos;s very hard to understand that this business can work .
I think it &apos;s like a rodeo show .
You can run a second company out of a company , a second company out of a company , which understands almost impossible who &apos;s behind the curtain .
It &apos;s very difficult to understand what &apos;s going on .
I think that &apos;s even more interesting , I don &apos;t think , in America .
It &apos;s probably not due to the famous American population .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in bribes .
It &apos;s because there &apos;s a way of asking companies , there &apos;s a few American villages in Moscow .
I think if we study the discoveries of Kenema Illinand , or Delhi Wayward or Nepal or Nepal , or Nepal , or Nepal , they &apos;re the ones that relate to America .
But many American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give little information to corporate companies , even from the Library of Labor .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
This brings new venture capital to humanity .
The narrative of this sector is affecting all of us .
Now in Gallup Watts , we wanted to see how she got involved .
How does this work ?
If we did this , we transferred a grant and delivered a grant to the 13 Chinese legal companies in Manhattan .
Our campaign became an African minister who wanted to travel to America in a home , a ship and a space to buy .
The heart note was that all of the villages gave a suggestion of how to move a schoolhouse .
These were all primary meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our own money , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but it got the stigma of the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not solved as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individual governments that have talked about our background and informed consent .
It &apos;s not just about a censorship policy that was found in Scandal .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which protect the security , the security and the insurgency .
And to meet that , we &apos;re going to change that game .
We &apos;re going to have to change the rules of the game in order to create difficulty in the region .
It can be intuitive , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people are always going to be free .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the footprint of transparency where the power of a company is happening .
This issue was sold on a political issue , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Information Commons held over eight meters that happened in southern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been forming the E.U. on a centrifuge , which is actually the country of the corporations or is controlling them .
The key thing is that the U.S. is behind it .
The variation in terms of abstract law enforcement is different in the center and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to grow , so we did .
They want to see the discoveries , the large companies , that have been used across the world and in the U.S.
This change is happening in the Gulf Watts .
Over the years , the worst form of harmony and brutality ought to be replaced by the leading attorney agencies behind closed lines .
You know , they speak up , and it &apos;s not good for a curiosity like this . We do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to address the legitimate change of understanding information .
We can bring the brakes to this arrangement , the incentives that are caused by taxation and school districts .
Chris Anderson : Good luck , Julian .
It &apos;s said that the Lexus , which you &apos;ve invented , in the last few years have had far more sensitive documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media .
Can it happen ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a legitimate thing . What &apos;s not ? It &apos;s showing that global media is fairly effective at bringing together a small group of factors that are more effective than all the rest of the world &apos;s media .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people make decisions ?
And how do you set them up ?
Julian Sanging : There they are . I can tell you , in the right sense , public service has been served , and we have a lot of ways to get information to us .
So we use a lot of clean water containers to shift materials from one place to the Internet , to deliver symbols to law enforcement courses like Sweden and Belgium at risk of law enforcement .
We get the data from the cloud , the public debate , the code or whatever , the public news agencies manage it , the parameters — which is sometimes very difficult , when you talk about mass information to public and then protect yourself against the illegal and political governments .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;re always fighting this life , and if we get stuck in a situation , we &apos;re going to have skin delivering that information .
( Whistling ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of cool and you &apos;re asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you thought about a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you thought and what happened next ?
Julian Sanging : There it is .
This was a hidden magic report that the government of Kenya had ordered after the Algeria in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was over there for 18 years .
He was a big fan of Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the book — the power of the authoritarian troops who were trying to decide that Kenya was going to spend 20 million pounds on the report card and one on the report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for its own political benefits , which was the poorest people — now Kenya &apos;s most well-educated people .
This is Jesus Christ .
So in 2007 , Kenya was invited , and we were successful in getting this election right from the very first election in December 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after the new report came out , Kabby decided to volunteer the person he was lying to , Daniel Arp Maui , so this reporter was handed over to the back of the report .
CA : And — so , I mean , in a nutshell , it &apos;s just — it &apos;s just been launched in Kenya , not by some crime , but by some means , and the result has changed the choice .
Julian Sanging : Yes . This is the headlines of Guardian and then ubiquitous throughout all of Kenya , in the news of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he believed , after a few months , the wonderful talent of Kenya to be able to talk about it .
And this blog was on the TV 20 days of Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the weather , according to a Chinese report , and it changed the result of the first election .
CA : Wow , so your current narrative actually changed the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re showing a little bit of a joke with the video of the world .
This is a video that &apos;s real , but here &apos;s a little clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a heartbreaking video .
RD : ... Good luck , when you first send them two .
I thought , oh , there are four things with them .
It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s okay . Galen &apos;s going .
When they &apos;re in front of you , tell me , go read .
They &apos;re all dollars .
Hold on , hold on !
( Mechanical noises ) Glass beat . Glass beat . ( Mechanical noises ) Glass beat .
Hatzalah . Hatzalah : two sides , two sides .
Now we have to leave , time is up !
Okay , now we killed eight people with arms .
Here we see two old helicopters , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Roger . They &apos;re on my side .
Two sides , that &apos;s two sides , we &apos;re on the verge .
Ooh , what &apos;s going to happen ?
God bless you , bless you . It &apos;s okay . It &apos;s okay . I killed them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julian Sanging : The people who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We ended up doing more research on this .
These were the first three wars that actually happened .
CA : So 11 people in this campaign got involved , right , two employees of the Reuters ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! The two employees of the Reuters , two young children were kidnapped .
In total , 18 to 26 people were killed .
CA : And after that , a lot of money .
What was the underlying reason he left , you know ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as the ultimate inequality of energy .
On the one hand , some people are walking around and then a kilometer away from helicopter 30 miles away , getting traffic jams on anyone — any number — and giving refugees a child .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t even aware of this , because it was so compelling .
CA : The U.S. Defense Administration got arrested with Broadmining , and it said that he had acknowledged that he had acknowledged this video of 280,000 violent American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanging : So what we did was we accepted the officials .
The work on this was done just five days ago , and it took 150,000 documents and 50 volumes .
But now we &apos;ve given him what he did in the beginning of the year , a consultant to the U.S. State Department , but there &apos;s nothing to do with them .
I mean , I used to come to this house a lot .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of condoms in the U.S.
Julian Sanging : We &apos;re giving them what we &apos;re doing . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do ? ) Julian Sangling : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sanging : Because these things show that , in fact , what are the states of Arab states , the real reversal of human rights in these states .
If you look at the hidden documents , the material is inside them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why would you want to create invisible information ?
Julian Sanging : So the question is , how important information in the world is , how much information can repair .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that managers buy for free rules , and it &apos;s a good indication that when information ought to be heard , it hopes to do something good , because the governments know it better , and they know their stories , they also care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks involved individually or collectively , in a more unexpected way , in terms of thinking ?
Julian Sanging : We did not do what the documents were with them .
I mean , our big , big government is busy .
With information , we &apos;re able to gather in a special way the information that &apos;s being expressed — the information that &apos;s being expressed by somebody .
But there are also some mysteries . For example , your doctor has your data ; it &apos;s awesome — but we &apos;re talking about these social services that come in and out of nowhere .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing this with a lot of excitement .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , whom my son is in the U.S. Foundation , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had this effect that some people are willing to rally other people .
It shows an American flag on dead people .
What this has impacted — but it has given millions of people around the world that the United States is a fair game .
Once they &apos;re not , my daughter &apos;s not , where would you say that ? So what would you answer ?
Julian Sanging : There are many questions like this .
But remember in prostitution , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , so they see it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to their peers , so there &apos;s no difference in their consciousness .
Because they &apos;re all looking at this .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and mindsets that give them numbers , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you think of hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are missing information .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t this sound so ridiculous to you that in order to shine light you need to be able to exercise yourself in the same way that you do ?
Julian Sanging : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the same genius as the other genius .
If they do this , this is going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in this way that people are morally inclined to feel that this is going to grow tomorrow .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , we &apos;ve made it to what we know — it &apos;s got to come out of the closets .
You can also predict that there will be different opinions about leaders and criminals .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or the problem .
What is the view of the Eurozone ?
And what &apos;s the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! You want to be there .
CA : These are very good people , Galen , very good people .
We &apos;re going to try and try . Consciousness is another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a very interesting story , which is the old one ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanging : This is an example of the work that we do almost every day .
Last year — in November , a lot of important breakthroughs came into banks , like the Gulf in Mexico , but not so much .
And we had a report — which was a very nice piece about it — which I was told was that in fact , conservation agencies were coming up with a lot of different oil companies , and they got stuck there and they got stuck .
And there were some formal government leaders , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above this platform , so this was a very difficult job for us .
We couldn &apos;t believe it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we were suspicious that perhaps this is a company that has done all this in the opposite direction .
At that foundation we did it , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
It &apos;s all right , and I look it right , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; And then we had a letter one week that wrote it , and he wanted to write it down . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Look , we want to write the word . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about constitutions ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legal for this ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they brought us through what we consider to be the Scripture with the name of the manufacturer , with the Microsoft WorldWide Web .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
This is a way to reconcile what material is , and that is to try to write and get the letters out of these people .
CA : All right . So is there any information from BP ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re going to collect and select multiple steps as difficult as possible .
Our recent explanation for this has become somewhat more useful in a few months because we improve our pockets for the rare public goods that we have .
It &apos;s immediate .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s already playing , most of our capacity is involved because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in the population that are smart , but we don &apos;t have people who can organize and trust this information .
CA : So that &apos;s a real problem , essentially , why are a couple of journalists or journalists ?
Julian Sanging : Yes . And incredible people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to solve very quickly , because with the material in our body , we need to organize so that we can bring people together that we have to work with a lot of emotional conservation , and then less sensitive stuff .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re telling us a little bit about yourself and how you &apos;re going to come to work .
And I think what I &apos;ve learned is that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movies business , and then moving away from the bridge , so that &apos;s why these two factors had an effect .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean , a psychologist would say that all things together can produce a difference .
Julian Sanging : What , movie theater ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one helicopter at a young age and you got into a lot of hard work systems .
Julian Sanging : I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time when the crime hit me .
That &apos;s why you have to convey the word together .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that you can use different things .
Sadly , at that time , it &apos;s only Russian Maasai that uses your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , doesn &apos;t matter what it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a parent &apos;s banker , but do you think of your core value ?
Can you tell us something about them about what they are and perhaps some reality in their life that has helped them survive ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : well , good , evil people don &apos;t generate impacts ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the reason that I learned from my father and some other powerful and aggressive people that live in my life .
CA : Brilliant and powerful people don &apos;t generate impacts ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a police guy , so I &apos;m not very good at agriculture , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of growing the police , which is closer to the police .
And that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s been in my career for so many years .
CA : So for the last few years , just this question : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , somebody has trouble with a bank , and then the news is that he &apos;s given the storytelling device to the storytelling .
Instead they inspired your status .
That &apos;s why you &apos;ve become so famous in Austria . So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , it &apos;s a great fact . You know .
Austria has developed a social crisis .
There was the highest .
The bankers here grew to become the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year .
And the critical mass of the Taliban had occurred five minutes before it was published , like a movie : &quot; The Horn Immune Services on Disk , and the situation of the New Reader was , &quot; That never happened to us before . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed the web server , spent all the time , spent the time , and we became very popular in Austria , I went to Austria and talked about this issue .
And the thing about the people over there was that there shouldn &apos;t be a virus again , and as a result , Six hundred people in the United Nations , working with some other international Mhernalists , we named a law which was created by a kind of freedom media , the greatest protected area in the world , the new Nepal prince , with a free heart .
A North American country is like a light bulb , which means it &apos;s going upward down in the system .
And just a month ago , the Australian Parliament looked at it perfectly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Soldiers .
When you look at the future , do you realize that much more expected to show power and energy , greater resilience , or are we going to see energy , or is it going to kill us ?
Julian Sanging : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more evidence to agree with the laws of liberty and the laws of transparency , around the world — in Europe , in China and in the U.S.
What &apos;s going to happen ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very exciting time to live — because with a small effort , we can get to one side or the other .
CA : Okay , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience into something called , quote , global warming , and all the energy for you .
Julian Sanging : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was totally in the bush .
I don &apos;t like eating and watching .
So I was doing this , which is a marathon .
I spent my childhood wandering around the streets of Connecticut , and I watched these videos go by .
As I grew up and got older and got home in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team was stuck .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , I suddenly realized how the rest of the world thought about it ?
And when I went to the Malaysian Mountains everywhere I went to suspect that North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or London , repeatedly seemed to be driving four species of beings — good , tough , cloudy and code .
And I thought this was a big deal , and I was amazed to see if anyone else had ever gotten a copy of this school .
And when I got into it , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching these cartoonists .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Consciousness is not an unusual human quality .
This is something we did 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the fossil record 10,000 years ago , I look at them as being rocks and dragonflies , you &apos;ll see all of these organisms .
But if you look back 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , cow , liver and beef .
It &apos;s also true for foreigners .
You &apos;re going to look at New York City &apos;s crossword puzzle 150 or 200 years ago on a pedestal like a DVD , a pig and a pig .
But if you look at the existing distance , you &apos;re only four years old , and the rain is going to be bright , slow , but also friendly .
It understands that we &apos;re growing this way .
How did our story happen ?
Shire .
This is a brand new problem .
For the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been doing something like this .
The second great war has given us the greatest motivation of being the weapon .
During the great war , we have lifted up technologies such as soap opera , polymer and so on into the history of all these things .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see the greatest additional capacity of mankind .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the mouse has become increasingly enjoyable in salt culture , and within a couple of years its growth has grown exponentially .
Now , if you collect fertilizer and fertilizer material , it will increase greenhouse gases every year from Samantha to China .
My favorite example of cooking in China is not an agreement , because China is not just one of the largest nations , but the largest nation is also frozen .
Let &apos;s now turn to your square legs .
First of all , the U.S. and the West are the most utilized salt food .
Goliath is an extraordinary misfit .
Only a pool of goods can carry five , 10 , 15 pounds of goods to market .
The Indus script is also unbelievable .
In one case study done in Delhi University , it turns out that methods like household charges don &apos;t work very well .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That in the remote regions of the Gulf , these are the mangroves .
Now look at these amazing figures .
They document the Earth &apos;s footprint , the protection of the coast , the land , the dirt and the marshmallow allow allow all of the important things for the environment .
For many years , this has happened with the Millennium Development Goals .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years feeding hundreds of thousands of coal plants .
Another operation that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Mark Bentham calls &quot; &quot; the killer of sleep . &quot; &quot; And as you look at the Tropical River , you &apos;ve seen that this is very controversial .
Now , there &apos;s some evidence that young adults are lying out of the hippocampus , but with it , with a very large number of other ants , they switch to the hippocampus after the hippocampus .
And a lot of times , it &apos;s been done by these guys who are named after the Red Brigades , who are named after the Red Brigades . It &apos;s the tragedy that we like to see on the Rift Valley , which means that the ecosystem is playing itself and making it cool .
After that , the United States and the West have a second big movement .
The tuna is a remote global campaign .
The tuna has to navigate a much larger area to organize as well as to organize .
We have a zone in which philanthropy is called the ICCAT , the International Committee for Environmental Protection Trains .
Carl Shepherd put up a great fight for all of this .
We can take tuna farms , but tuna farms are not good enough .
Too many people don &apos;t know , but tuna &apos;s warm blood .
He can surprise over 40 miles an hour , and the temperature of his body can heat over 20 bucks a gallon around his environment .
All of the benefits of the millennium are closed .
The filter of the filter is the filter of blood that doesn &apos;t make it any more toxic .
This is the best protein .
But what is astonishing about a 40-mile radius is that it cannot be swallowed in the floor .
Time has gotten a good luck . It doesn &apos;t have to be a bad day .
This is my politics Connect .
Connecticut was leaving the forest floor .
If you look at the scale of the Connecticut , each dot has to be one dictionary .
In the politics of Connecticut there are more than 3,000 supplies .
I &apos;m actually saying that more people in Connecticut — ( Laughter ) — if anyone ever turns on the power of a cake , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere , these are the rockets that come from giving birth to the children of Zambia .
As a result , we have a success in the parameters and the parameters .
When the dawn of time began , there were six pounds of deforestation to create a foundation .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
In the contrast , this is also a small false paper , because if you look at the Freeman &apos;s Facebook page , they name the keynote of time in the web .
Now , this is a feedback loop from the kitchen .
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s hard to say something about metal and metal .
But then again , the credit card industry tells us that it &apos;s become the leadership of the Phood Symphony .
That &apos;s the kind of system that &apos;s created by the Ecuadorian Enceladus .
That &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the year .
Even though we save a little bit less money to get into the market , we save a lot of money , but then we save a lot of money .
We &apos;re not just playing celebrities , we &apos;re also playing celebrities and women .
We have all the little bits that are baking and the little bits that are baking .
Because on the other hand , the blood and the hands go to hell .
I was surprised to see what else he had saved , but he had saved the marshmallow .
India is the first or the first person to die — ( Laughter ) — as a result , it &apos;s a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of vegetable organisms that have been discarded from the census .
That &apos;s the equivalent of China &apos;s third party , or the equivalent of American people getting out of bed every year .
The last thing in four parts is this .
Philadelphia actually started as a liposuction .
And it started to look like a local banker who saw that the next day , none of the microloans showed up .
He turned to the head and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s have a look .
What &apos;s going to take more than a pencil for Alexander was one thing to prove that Hulu is not a Jesus .
So he built his own liposuction scenario .
Incidentally , it came in 30 cents .
He wanted it to be 25 cents long , so he set up the Titanic code .
Actually , the Philadelphia police department is the largest public art industry in the United States , where art is going from two to three pounds a year to three pounds a year .
If we finish the police , the alternative choice might be trivial .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It turns the plasma protein into a very exciting way in the animal protein , and that &apos;s me for the third world .
Actually , this is a very promising solution that &apos;s coming out of an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a windmill .
There are no iPods and DVDs that we think will be keeping us alive .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor little Maltese Falcon .
That &apos;s a representation of the order of magnitude of about three million tons .
One possibility that conservation community needs to understand is , can we eat it ?
Can we play it instead of data ?
There &apos;s evidence for this .
They have an Indian brilliant child from the market , where the average elite in the fight against lying is at the top of the Indus Valley .
This is OMG 3 , EPA and DNA .
So this is her ability .
But instead of giving you a few dollars or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds , did we convert that into a footprint and reveal the mysterious gestures that we have ?
The other thing that &apos;s even more interesting is that they &apos;re home specifically .
They have much more EPAA and DNA .
The Indus calculus is incredibly powerful .
Edinburgh is only three times more expensive than cooking .
Actually , the average person comes from three villages .
Special Olympics builds three vertices in the kitchen , so they just come together .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our parents &apos; garages , we have become fascinated by the use of Facebook and Netizens .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been producing death , which is the leading cause of death in human life .
As you can think about clicks , in all these different sectors , there are more than three , and these are very efficient things .
It &apos;s just like that .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can create a kind of molecule that will give us the benefits of artificial protein .
It needs to be green , it needs to be green , it needs to be green , it needs to be green , it needs to be green , it needs to be green , it needs to rise , it needs to be green , it needs to be EPA , DHA OMG3 , it needs to be FED .
This is already in food .
I &apos;ve been conducting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We &apos;re one .
But try to do something about it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the space .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to understand without our needs .
But if we do something about it , the problem becomes a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was going to study the big brain because I have a brother who is the CDC .
Good and then I wanted to understand , as a society , how do I connect my dreams from my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they don &apos;t divide their dreams in public and in shared reality , and they stop doing it .
So I stopped looking at mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my parents &apos; office in India , where I was working for Dr. Frankenstein Bank , which was a philosophy at Harvard University .
Because what was the difference in the brain of people who were looking at biological responses , what was the significance of the brain that was generally perceived as negative compared to the brain of people who were in schizophrenia or in Pythagorean studios ? So in fact , we were trying to create the microbial dissection of the brain , which cells are messing with the chemical and the amount of chemical
So I had a lot of advice in my life because I was studying this section every day . &quot; &quot; But at night and weekend , at night , I was like , &quot; &quot; The National Election took a flight to the NAMI .
But on December 10th , 1996 , I found myself in the middle of nowhere .
The left part of my brain was a nickname .
And in the last four minutes , I watched my brain become completely disconnected from any ability to understand information .
In the morning of February , writing polls was hard to remember .
I was a native child in the body of women .
If you ever look at the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from one another .
I &apos;m going to show you a human brain .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that touches the left part of the brain , and this is how it &apos;s going to play inside my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see that two parts of the brain are completely identical .
For those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain is operating like a parallel processor , whereas our left brain is operating like a parallel processor .
Those two parts are delivering messages to each other through the culture of the Korean community , which has 300 volunteers to collect .
But there are also two parts of it .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing that each part has a different understanding of information , knowing that their blood is different , and you give it away , and I tell them who their personalities are different from each other .
Congratulations . Thank you very much .
Audience : Yes , a lot .
( Laughter ) The evidence of our brain is only now and thinking about it .
Now , at this point , the evidence of our brain is thinking about mental images that think of our body &apos;s emotions .
Information is stored in the form of energy , stored and restored in our entire nervous system , and then slowed it down into the form of a great album that tells us how to think about the existing context and how to feel about the mind and how to feel .
I am an energy that &apos;s driven by the energy of my neighborhood , by the sense of the right brain .
We are the energy systems that are driven by each other by the perception of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at that time , we are the great pioneers of this planet whose generosity is making the world better .
And in that sense , we are all the best and the most beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
Our left brain is thinking scientifically and systematically .
Our left brain is about the past and the future .
The construction of the left part of the brain is like this : we take the largest alumni of our time and we collect the details and then we begin to collect the details .
And it also informs the organization and the understanding of all the things that are going on in the past that we &apos;ve learned , and the possibilities of the future , namely , limits the impact on our projects .
The left part of our brain is thinking about language .
It &apos;s a chain of conversations that define us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a little voice that says to me , &quot; Sue has to remind you to go home and buy . &quot;
I &apos;m going to need them in the morning , and that &apos;s the feeling of making my computer book that reminds me that I have a book .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; I am ! I am ! &quot;
And like all of my left brain is telling me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m becoming very honest .
I become one of the only lovely people in my neighborhood with incredible energy and energy from you .
And that part of my brain was taken off the campaign this morning .
The morning of the campaign , my eyes turned to me in the back of my eyes with a stick of pain .
It was the tension of that section , like the Aristotle &apos;s Siq .
And he pulled me back and forth like this .
And then he leaves , and then he leaves .
It was extraordinary to me that I had never had any suffering , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No way , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to the gymnasium and I put my card billboard on the front of my body .
Now I &apos;m stuck with this machine , and I feel like my hand is just the tip of an initial human being that &apos;s moving the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , that sounds so weird and weird . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like my perception changed , which is the general sense of truth in which I &apos;m a human being , which is on the machine , but now I was in a kind of ubiquitous and hidden place where my sense of
And it was all very strange and poor , and my brain was increasing .
So I moved out of the machine , and I started speaking in the room , and I felt like everything in my body had gotten difficult .
And the number is very difficult and very thinkable .
I have no connection in my speed , and because of the idea that there &apos;s a home problem , I &apos;m just focusing on the inner system .
I &apos;m growing up in my own underwater family , and I &apos;m really getting a word out of my body .
I heard a sound that said , and my background is now supposed to play you .
I &apos;m standing behind you , and I &apos;m not balancing my balance , I &apos;m scribbling and I &apos;m scribbling the wall .
I look around and I look at my hand , and I realize that now I can &apos;t organize my body &apos;s limitations .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand and my hand are held together by the atom and the mechanical wall .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And so the speech of the left part of my brain got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice of T.V. monitoring .
A blood vessel .
First of all , I was struck by the trauma of my brain .
But then immediately , like another one , the energy came into the platform in this huge space that was right around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt my sense of urgency and strength .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; You know , there &apos;s no problem . &quot;
We need to help , and I told myself , I &apos;m really bored from a problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I &apos;m really bored with a problem , but I immediately came back with the same feeling that I say a lot of money .
But it was a very beautiful place .
Can you measure how beautiful it will be to be in a place where you are totally tied to this fragile brain that keeps you from the outside world ?
So I &apos;m in this cell where I &apos;m sleeping and I &apos;m having a conversation about it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And measure all of your relationships from the outside world , and any of them have been degraded .
And I felt a sense of security .
And measure what it would look like if you lied that 37-year-old motor weight that you were left with .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a mess .
It was so beautiful .
And then my brain got to the left side of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , give me two .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should help , I should help , so I went from the washing room to the bedside , and before I left the engine , I &apos;m going to run into my apartment , and now I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive a car ? &quot; &quot; And so my mother &apos;s hand was completely paralyzed .
At that time , it occurred to me that my God was going through the battle of golf , the last thing my mind tells me is , how big is it ?
( Laughter ) How amazing !
I &apos;m going to be a brain researcher who &apos;s going to describe the moment that they can sense their own brains and that they can — ( Laughter ) — and then one blood comes to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m very nervous . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to waste . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t fix the golf cart , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll get back to my funeral . Okay .
I have to call for help . I have to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to remember the job title , and then I remembered that I had my notebook card on my phone number .
I then go into my classroom and I do a three-inch M &amp; M building .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card as I can see from my brain &apos;s eye what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this card doesn &apos;t exist because I don &apos;t have to look at the exact same points .
And the words would be helped by scores of paper and signs , and I wasn &apos;t learning anything .
And then I started waiting for him to say goodbye to me .
And at that point , the public meets the public realm again , and I learned that it &apos;s not a card ; it &apos;s not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to reduce that death toll .
And at that time , the effects of the 45-minute depletion were increasing at the bottom .
I don &apos;t understand the phone . I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have a way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I downloaded the credit card and put it there , and now I look at the credit card and I look at the credit card as big cats on the phone .
But then I snuck to my left country when I was walking back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I told him not to .
So I held my pillow &apos;s hand like a doll and I held my hand up to the synagogue , and I held my hand up to the other hand and said , &quot; &quot; When I get back to the public truth , I can tell you that I had just arrived in India the last few years , and I heard that my phone was coming out of the house , and a guy called me up the phone , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow
So I say to her , very clearly in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking to myself , I need help . &quot;
And from my voice , there &apos;s something like &quot; &quot; Woo hoo hoo , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; My servant is also like a Golden Retrier . &quot; &quot; And he left me with the lesson that I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak a language until I tried to read .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And a little while later , in one of the ambulance sessions , Sierra Leone was running from one of the other Massachusetts General Hospital .
I slept and looked like a baby bottle .
Just like the one cloud that keeps falling apart from each other , I pulled the energy out and I felt the weather .
And it occurred to me that now I &apos;m not choosing my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me the opportunity to have a second life , or the opportunity for my transport .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I was alive .
When I felt the gift of my soul , I said to God .
Now my brain was divided into two versions of reality .
At that time , the emotion of my perceptual system began to develop , which only felt the pain of God .
Light shattered my brain like a forest fire , and the lights were on fire and the lights were blowing back , and because of the background , I was hearing a voice , or I was not hearing a voice , and I was listening only to the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize the objections of my body , so I felt enormous and widespread , like someone who had gotten rid of my own pool .
And my spirit was unraveling , like a great evangelical evangelical moment in the middle of nowhere .
Great neuron .
He gave me the qualities that he provided .
And I remember thinking , this is never going to be possible , that I could find my own great appetite and access to a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive . &quot;
I &apos;m alive now and I &apos;ve been brought to sleep .
And if I get bored and I &apos;m alive now , whatever life is that can happen to the neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world that has been married by people who have been beauty , dignity , compassion and love that they know can ever feel that quality .
And they can pick and choose the right to have books on the left side of their brain that are going to take their feet off in search of this grave quality .
And then I understood how incredible this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What is this image of a photograph that taught me to navigate my life ?
And he gave me permission to be healthy .
A hundred years after the Full campaign took blood out of my brain about a dozen years later that was investigating the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
I &apos;ve been perfectly healthy for eight years .
So where are we ?
We are the power of life , the power of life , with two very specific skills and two very specific brains .
And we have the power to choose and to choose the space in the world where we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can stand at the right side of my feeling , &quot; where we are .
I am the energy of life in the universe . I am the energy of life .
Fifty tries of beautiful , organic macro-molecular cellulose are made of a shape , one in which everybody exists .
Or I can choose to stand on the left side of my consciousness where I become an individual . &quot; &quot; In a typical way .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Whoa !
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
I have a self .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And guess what ?
I think whenever we spend our left-right brain reserves electricity in the world , we &apos;re going to free the security of the world and our planet is going to be the dominant force .
And I thought it was necessary to filter this idea .
Thank you .

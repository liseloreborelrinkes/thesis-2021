Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They picked up my name , but I &apos;d like to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Arabic ?
No ! No ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , before a young age , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating .
So I asked him , do you have the desire to eat in Arabic ?
He looked at me in a strange way , thinking he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Sir . In Arabic , for religious reasons . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Is French the right word ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; she said .
He was speaking to me with three people , as he said to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her ! &quot;
What does the word &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young man who made two words placed a girl in exactly the same way . And instead .
How can he speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What is it about me that I have in my country to speak my language ?
Where does that happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am as many people as I possibly can , who are reaching a point in their lives where they are literally drowning everything that is in their own backyard , just in order to say that they like it so much and so forth .
Should I embrace my whole culture , my imagination , my spirit and my spirit ?
Maybe we have the most important wars in the stories of children .
Do they want to give me something that I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
How does that make sense ?
And yet , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision in the same way that he did for me .
Arabic doesn &apos;t require necessity today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or research , the language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we teach when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at Harvard .
If we do that , then they shape our destiny .
So where can I communicate this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . Where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the mother language .
Research tells us that in other languages , skills are essential to achieve their mother &apos;s language .
In other languages , the teaching of the mother is primary for the creative expression .
How ?
The Gibran cell type , when he first started writing , exploited Arabic .
All of their ideas , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in this village where she grew up , felt a certain sense of gratitude , a certain voice , and thought about it .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn their literature in English , you feel the same sense of happiness , the same feeling .
You can imagine that in English these are also their teachers , these little girls who live in the village outside of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are emerging .
Crime , France , Japan and China are in all sorts of ways .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in their ports , they spend a lot of money on their advertisements .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this growing mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to look to the developed world .
They were countries that were like us in the same time , but decided to try to grow , to study , and to go to countries , like schools , workers and so on , they laid out their language just like they were teaching girls , like Heroes .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you take texture or where you make products and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be included in these reefs , unknown reefs , like we are more time .
So to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to preserve their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; security , autonomy , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will remind you ?
What do you get ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages aren &apos;t just about talking , words are about us .
Language is a symbol of the level of our lives , and the words that are separated from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Self-consciousness , self-determination , freedom , &quot; &quot; then each one of you will create a special location in your brain . There are special emotions for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our area ?
How would you say you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t look at a problem , then I &apos;d better go and spend some time indoors .
The thing is , these affections remind us of a particular thing .
A French speaker friend of mine is a French speaker .
I was asking this question once .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to elaborate her husband and translate her , I tried one night to figure out what &quot; &quot; reconciliation &quot; &quot; means . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Women vaguely called her &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He was thinking , how could it be so obvious ?
Do they want to self-destruct ?
&apos;Bury me . &apos; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of many examples .
It made us feel that he was not making his wife meaning the word , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right by the way ; his thoughts were different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he says to me , and one night , I tried to translate it to what I felt when I heard it tomorrow . &quot; &quot; The girl tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have raised my hand and why you have it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the reason is , because you are me , I have put my hand on and you have left . &quot; ( Laughter )
He translated it . He showed me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do for the Arabic language ?
We changed it to a way of thinking about society , and we started a curriculum in Arabic .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Whatever the hell is heavy , let &apos;s move on . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protagonist received a message , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you respond to the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because in that way , we didn &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody tells me , I &apos;m fascinated by the Arabic language .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be confident in the way that our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives take place .
That &apos;s how the letter looks and what we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re responding to the West . &quot; &quot; The right sign is posted .
It &apos;s very easy , but it works and it works .
After that , we started another experiment with the landscape of the orbit .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , a context in which the letters of black and white are in the background , with the text that says , &quot; Make Language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really don &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We have to find our existence .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s much easier for us to enjoy the opportunity to create new and compassion .
Later , we found Arab scripts , girls and girls .
&quot; &quot; Cole &quot; &quot; photos of boys and girls .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve described the word &quot; &quot; dictionary &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; but I have to say the same word that &apos;s good and that &apos;s true .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We don &apos;t have to cure ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to allow anyone to grow up , or that we &apos;re going to have the authority of our language , to press on us , to press on us , to confront our patients and to think .
We need to invent our ideas .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t refine the skeleton and so on , we can be creative .
At this point , each of you is a creative project .
There is a way to create in mother &apos;s language .
So let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only one neuron can reach us globally .
He can re-branch Arabs first .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s solutions .
But we &apos;ll have to know , and we &apos;ll have to assume that the solution exists , the solution is our guess .
Last year , what can you do today ?
Who here is Twitter ?
In Judaism , I reject you , though , my time is over , either Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the English alphabet , doesn &apos;t write English !
( Applause ) It &apos;s remarkable ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back and get bigger .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for conservation in this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a way .
A child speaks for the first time in a language of her father .
When my daughter is born , I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , yeah . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I admitted to my daughter that in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom , &quot; &quot; won &apos;t say .
And it &apos;s not expected that no one will ever hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of shopping . ( Applause )
I &apos;m telling you Latin English to tell us that this is what we remember when we weren &apos;t in a position where we weren &apos;t in a position where the negative impacts of my people were starting to disappoint them , until you saw my generation without a bank , and we got stuck with this generation of inequality so that our generation didn &apos;t succeed until they were celebrated for donations , so many of us
( Applause )
My favorite clip is the dot .
In college , my primary intention was vegetables , which meant I had to write more material .
Now the average person who writes anything , this approach works something like this .
You know ... ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll get started early , but last week you do a lot of work and more work later , everything &apos;s done , and it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;d like to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be everything ready , but it &apos;s actually going to be at the top of the text , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with every text .
And then again , there &apos;s a whole new set of pages of research papers , the text that you do in one year .
And I knew that my common practice wasn &apos;t a recipe for this kind of thing .
It was a huge task .
I set up a plan , and I decided that I would do something like this .
This is how it &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m going to start small , in the middle of the month , the speed of the task is going to grow , and eventually I &apos;m going to grow it more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Come on and go home , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we created a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then it would be gone , and I hadn &apos;t written anything , and we had something .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went away one day and spent three days in the DRC , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote 90 pages , two streets , two streets , two streets , three streets , two streets , two streets , three streets , four streets , four streets , four streets , three streets , four streets , four streets of
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a job and she was out of school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tim ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you about your dad . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;ll see you today , that &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was a very good general . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you were all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the system .
My roommate constantly gives me feedback , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s happening in the human brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that lists of people make differences in the brain compared to six people .
To find out , I made a leaf where I could put both brains in the same way and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look away and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but consider it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the stereotypical brain is fun to make .
Now what does this mean for a singer ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it doesn &apos;t happen .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work is the best time . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart people will make decisions in order to make sense , but they don &apos;t like this project , so he takes the command , and he says , &quot; &quot; Make a page on the page . &quot; &quot; Tennessee and touch hardware , because I know it &apos;s happening .
( Laughter ) So â€” ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;re going to go to the pub , and see , in the next 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After this , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which will start at the headlines about the race to the TED Foundation , and much later , it will end up looking at the Internet for the mothers of the Twin Bridge .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take some time for all of these things , so there won &apos;t be any time for it today .
How would that be ? ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the kind of pleasure you want to give .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It has to do with the ignorance of the future , which is just two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , it &apos;s all good .
If you know and you spend your entire life going further and further , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to create , there is a generation of human animals .
Good to eat , good to think , and increase generation , that &apos;s probably what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , the passenger is not very far away .
We are an increasingly educated species , and yet we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a conscious decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is to figure out what makes us happy .
Sometimes it seems just as true that what they do is easier and easier to eat , think , or enjoy the moments of opportunity .
There &apos;s a picture for that .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do things that are difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the ultimate map .
And for strangers , this compromise always leads to an end , which spends a lot of time in the middle of nowhere , a simple and fancy way that has been around for centuries .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) Dark field is the place where strangers are so well known .
That &apos;s where dignity comes when it doesn &apos;t have to be a director .
The dark spaces that further you are are are not actually further than that , because they &apos;re not right , spatial feelings , crime , fear , anxiety , and feelings of hatred themselves â€” all of the properties that are in the right order .
The question is , in this case , when manufacturing gets sent , how does the system get into balance , which is unhappy but important ?
It turns out that systems also reserve protection , which protect them all the time in their exact moments â€” somebody tells him at home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly comfortable , but when David lines up , it becomes very comfortable , or at the time when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the key thing is that the building is just like that .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago the TED guys called me and gave me a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was to participate in TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and my anger , something else was happening in the brain of conscious decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we go to Google and look at the Indian map for less than 20 feet , we &apos;ll just go home till we see India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , another month , and the TEDsters decided to name the critic .
I downloaded the Web and it was a photograph of me holding onto it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house that was monitored , and within seconds the system turned out to be on fire . ( Laughter )
And he remembers â€” he &apos;s afraid of the house â€” he leaves the tree !
And finally , and finally , the religious decision-maker shifted the boat and I could start working on conversation .
Now the street judgment that talks about in every category is a poster , someone like me would spend two weeks or two weeks writing , and the beginning of the article will not be written , and then suddenly , incredibly successful tools of work can be downloaded all night long and written .
And the accomplishment of three cleanliness is what we call the system of strangers .
That &apos;s not very good . That &apos;s not how it works .
And a few years ago , I decided to write blogs about this .
When I wrote this , it surprised me with the influence on it .
In fact , I got thousands of emails from around the world and from people , from all kinds of different backgrounds .
They included nurses , builders , engineers , penetrators , and also CDs .
( Laughter ) And nearly one thing was saying and writing : &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this issue . &quot;
What struck me was the number of emails asked and the number of emails .
In the textbooks of these people , it was written about how much the system was telling them about what it was done .
I thought about it , and I said , okay ! If the system is right , then what happens ?
Why are they all in black ?
It turns out that the list is two vertices .
The examples I gave you today , which were all about subjects , were all about data .
And when David &apos;s lying , the effects of his recession are overwhelmed because of the housing that &apos;s coming .
But the Stone is a different type of approach , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any David .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like some art or businesses â€” like some art or businesses , when you don &apos;t start paying attention to learning the speed , to control the work .
There are also many things besides career work that aren &apos;t dating , such as getting from home , learning , thinking about your health , thinking about your relationships , telling your relationships well that you &apos;re not walking around .
Now if the only way to get a job is to get a house that &apos;s difficult , because all of the data is in the context of the house that &apos;s being lost .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with us .
And this is a type of typical metaphor that &apos;s much less likely to see and much less about it than about the typical metaphor , which is a neat basis .
You &apos;re running out of noise and bad news .
And this can become the driving force of tyranny and reading .
So I thought that was the reason they were emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Toyal Society has seen them , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot afford to pay for their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and it showed something â€” I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think you &apos;re all expensive .
Now , I may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of the DVDs in the U.S. are good at reading , but memory keys are good at reading when the DVD is not there .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the life cylinder .
Every block represents a week , it &apos;s in the new year .
These aren &apos;t so many blocks , especially when something of them ends up being common .
I think we all need to get to this candle .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because in every single life there &apos;s no time to go .
We need to be careful with the generation of compassion .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have a home yet , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s short .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eight days in the U.S. and Afghanistan , an access of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan were flooding from a neighborhood in Afghanistan to a region in Afghanistan that would help the Afghan security forces a government office to help the security forces to help the Afghan security forces a government to help the security forces a government to help the Afghan security forces the Afghan
He had just come out of an attack , and he was staying around with three surroundings , and with a lot of things , he watched as a child by the time Captain Seventeen was born , and he watched as a child by the time Captain Seventeen would grow up , and he watched as a child by the time he &apos;d saved his neighbors and took his dead relatives out .
One of the eight-year-old orangutans , one of whom was studying the slime mold , and he was raising towards a hero cap , and he was also raising towards a hero cap .
So what this shows is that the Cape Seventine and Ice Shelf reveal the cylinder of warming .
They put them in a helicopter , and then you see that the captain dwells and they repel them before they can feed others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something about it .
There &apos;s a love , and I knew why I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , at the end of the day you &apos;re welcome to these people who want to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In business , we give these people the desire to win others so that we can benefit .
We have an Italian account !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that they were better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re falling aside .
These are better people embracing the imagination of services ; these are better people embracing the imagination of services .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a habitat , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the capacity to work together , so we have the capacity to work together , to work together , and to enhance that capacity for others to do that .
I have the privilege of bringing together some of these people , and we will say tomorrow I have the privilege of bringing together some of these people , we will say yesterday â€” ( Applause ) â€” who have taken your soul and put your knowledge in danger to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that these emotions are not mutations .
It &apos;s not possible for you to say &quot; &quot; pass me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It &apos;s not possible that I get two people to cooperate and they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does that leave ?
If you go back 50,000 years , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , these are all very focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Wanting is a lack of resources , a lack of knowledge , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce the long-term deficit of our lives .
And so we &apos;re ready for social animals where we &apos;re together and we work together as part of what I call a spiritual portion , as in a circle where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we felt reassuring and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
It means that I can go to sleep at night and I can swim to see some of the dangers of my neighbors .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you there , it means you &apos;re not going to look at the risk .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by the dangers of things that are trying to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our opportunity to succeed .
This can be a society that can stretch large numbers of unbelievable circumstances of the stock market .
It can be a new technology that &apos;s going to disrupt your business landscape one night , and it can be a new technology that &apos;s going to disrupt your business landscape one night .
Or you can have the opposite that sometimes you try to curb .
It sometimes tries to lock you up from the businesses , but at least it tries to lock you up and your businesses to lock you up , it tries to lock your growth and your businesses to lock you up .
We have no authority on those power .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never be done .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is done , because it &apos;s the belief that it determines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the people in her organization and their lives that are supposed to defend the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to value their personality and their grace results so that people are there and that they sacrifice their own personal and truthful results so that people can feel safe and feel their personal connections so that they can control things .
I was on a journey , and I noticed a fact that when a pilot had tried to step in front of me before he found it , and I saw the people on the front door that he would come in like he passed the law as it was me .
One time before I tried to walk on it , the first time I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are we doing things like electricity ?
Why can &apos;t you stand with us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Air Force is not because they &apos;re keeping the LHC alive .
That &apos;s why they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if the circumstances are overwhelming , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from each other , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from each other , and that makes the institution less .
What a great leader can give you the most close example of how a parent is going to be a good leader for her , and the most close example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how good parents are , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , discipline and accountability , when necessary , we want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the discipline , when necessary , to make them grow and to achieve more of what we can do for themselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Great leaders want exactly that .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline , precision , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , structure and precision , when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to give them the opportunity to act on time and failure so that they can achieve the greater successes that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve greater success than what we
Charlie Kamen , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump in New York City , says , if your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever let your children go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charley has actually lost control over prostitution , and Charley has essentially lost control of prostitution .
If you &apos;re a Next Jump employee , you don &apos;t get a job based on effective problems .
But if you have a problem , then they will guide you and help you , exactly like we would do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why these groups of people are so frustrated and ugly , some of the bankers are recruiting CEOs , and the reason these groups are so frustrated and so resourceful , some of the bankers are recruiting CEOs , and that &apos;s why these groups are so violent and so resourceful , some of the bankers are recruiting from CEOs , who are unequally depressed
It &apos;s not about data .
They have laid down the basic principles of prudence .
They have broken a society .
We know that they have given their well-being kids the victory of their loved ones , and we know that they have given their well-being kids the victory of their loved ones , but that they have given their well-being children the victory of their loved ones , but that they have convinced their well-being because of their well-being .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do , not data .
Could it be that the assumption that gives bed nets 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Are we in trouble ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save money .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save money .
They &apos;re going to give people skin insights into infants , but they &apos;re going to give people skin insights into infants .
Baby Chip Minister of Media sent a mining company in Baby Chip Media to run a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and he had a great deal of marketing , and he had 30 percent of the folks on the road overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy furniture more .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , so many of the companies that are now locked up and made millions of practices .
And Bob replied it .
You see , the Boomers don &apos;t trust the Boomers .
It &apos;s much harder to believe in the generation of bodies , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce disease and reduce disease .
And then they created a personal project .
that every job , every service , every service , every service , every service , every CEO , needs to be locked up for four weeks without restraint .
They could do whatever they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow .
But as Bob showed the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said it was better that we all had small risk factors , that some of us would take a lot more risk and be more aggressive .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as they expected , when people feel protected from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And in the same way that nobody had anticipated , people started trading off each other .
What was more successful was they traded with less successful families .
That is , somebody has licensed five volunteers so that somebody else has to license another three volunteers .
Gravity is an extreme .
I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the most advanced markets in organizations , and I know a lot of people who are benefiting the most advanced markets in organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs and we do what they say because they have authority , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are at the bottom of the organization who have no authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the authority to look at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the authority to look at the person on the left , and they have the authority to look at the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the figures that had gone out in the kitchen , and as a way to do science is to eat the foodies of tomorrow , and he eats his people first , and when he eats , he saves nothing for it .
And when he returned to the field , his friends gave him some food from his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them they do it first .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re sending someone else risk , we call them leaders because they &apos;re sending someone else risk before .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , and we call them leaders , because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them and so that people can benefit them , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people see us .
They will give us our blood and our penis and our kidneys so that they can see that their dreams become real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and your pancreas and you give it to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because that &apos;s what they do for us . &quot; &quot; And what if it &apos;s not the organization that we all want to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to do ? &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with the story of the Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the supply of water and water is as unbelievable as casualties , it &apos;s very difficult to grow in these conditions once I was 17 years old , I was staying quiet with my friends in the bush .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was peering down the street , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t have to be broken ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-five million of them are in Africa , and there &apos;s only one million in South Africa .
Different diseases accumulate in this environment , which is the most dangerous trachoma .
The reason the Trachoma is a reflex that occurs in the eye is because of one of the more extensive developments of the trachoma that you can instantly engage in .
This illness infuses millions of people every year on a regular basis , and what &apos;s most challenging is that in order to save the tragedy you have to give to your mother : no eggs , no vegetables , no English .
After I looked at the data , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I took my brother &apos;s 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I went to Google and
And I looked at this as a personal problem .
So Jesus said it was right , our formula was ready .
Now we need to be able to make that happen .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on my phone , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent troll in the country and â€” ( &quot; &quot; now and no shit ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t tell you more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first glorious alternative .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to burn .
( Laughter ) So after the attempt to make this work in the schools and the limited resources that I had , the Millennium Development Index brought in some new people , further this work , and now we have fully the impact on the distribution that is ready for the market , now available at the market .
We &apos;ve learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at large .
They just buy it below the need . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cigarettes ; they buy a cigarette every day , because it &apos;s more important than that .
So we put DryBath in these creative slices .
You have to put it in between and out .
And the best thing is , a simple replacement of a cake is only in five rings .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath to be there in less than a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever the salt breaks down and we could save two houses for the kids , which are already in the middle of two houses , more than two extra houses for the school , two extra houses for the kids .
After watching this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out of its core values , transparency and service .
DryBath is a rich man &apos;s life and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re now entering a process by which we &apos;re actually going to sell it to a multinational brand , which is to go to the retail market , and one question I &apos;m going to ask you today is to go to the Limpopo convenience , which is to go to the Limpopo convenience , which is to deal with a 50-pound elephant per week with an antenna that does not have to dominate the world
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned so much in this process , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I am the world &apos;s greatest entrepreneur right now , the first African to call this accolades , and one thing that amazes me so much , which is why all of this wouldn &apos;t have to go blind . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m here today to show you some of the results that are out there and I &apos;m also wondering what are the actual reasons for the success of organizations â€” which are factors because of the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you select a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , then you will find that human potential is unprecedented .
You &apos;re going to make them possible .
But , if initial organizations are the best , why often fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know that eventually things are the most important for success .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , and I wanted to find a lot of frustrations and misconceptions that came to me from some of the organizations in the last year .
I wanted to know this because I was building different businesses from the age of 12 , from the age of 12 to the nursery station on a low-performing stage in high school , all the way to school when solar power was invented , then high school , when I was making radio .
I left high school , I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the iPod started , over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve made 100 companies founding so many successes , so many huge failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain to you the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; which is the old moment that you feel about something .
With all of this , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to be skilled or injured , is more essential .
I never thought it would be possible for a speaker here at TED to talk about Mike Titon , but once he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan , until I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business as usual .
It &apos;s important to empower a team to learn from scratch .
Each one is an Italian reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at business models .
Does an organization have a clear effect on income ?
With that in mind , it seemed to me that what is most important for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies make huge investments .
Could that be the most important ?
After that , of course â€” is it time ?
Did it happen so fast , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s short , so you &apos;re going to come and teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or so much later , and so much more terrible ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of the need for these five factors in many institutions .
And the idea was to reach out to 100 companies in Libya , and 100 of them outside of the organization to try and get a scientific result .
So before these ideas , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoGoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” these are all dollars of success .
And on the lower level , five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink â€” we were hopeful , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to put all these figures in the same way that I think these companies had promoted .
Then in the outsiders of ideas , I &apos;ve seen weird successes , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in the old companies , and sometimes there was a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the biggest influence of all these companies was the success and failure , and the result struck me .
The first was the choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent is in the gap between success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other side of the spectrum , and then , I think , being different , being unique , it &apos;s actually a third multiplication .
But it &apos;s not really a fluke , it &apos;s not that the thought doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was amazed that the thought doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business models and investment in my mind .
I think the business model doesn &apos;t really matter because you can start a business model without a product model , and then when the product gets big enough to add in .
And investment , if initially low investment , is now increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples here of all of these notes .
Take the big Airbnb success that everybody knows .
It &apos;s very famous to see how many investors this company looked because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to put some of our houses into a grocery store ?
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of the mosquito is that the best business model , the workplace , and the workplace , is the right time .
This company came in front of these financial problems when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people to respond to advertising to their homes .
That &apos;s Uber &apos;s business .
Uber came forward , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
However , the time was absolutely right to make the donors they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional support ; it was absolutely essential .
Some successes , like Citysearch came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we published back in 1998 , was when companies wanted more disclosure .
We thought it was the best , but in fact , the right time was probably more .
And then something failed .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about this â€” with a lot of colleagues and a great business modeling , to work with some of the great leaders in Hollywood .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband band was very low .
It was very difficult to see online videos , you didn &apos;t know what to do in your browser , and eventually this company was in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of coding and broadband loaded 50 percent in the United States , YouTube got the best time .
Interestingly , the best of times .
The truth is that YouTube , when it started , had no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was extremely optimistic .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
The idea is very important .
But maybe time &apos;s choices matter .
And the best way to validate time is to see if they &apos;re really ready for your benefit .
And the real confidence is , the outcome doesn &apos;t come from them , because if something you like , you want to keep it in the future , but in terms of time friction you have to work with a lot of reliability .
As I said earlier , original organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of them will be helpful to increase your success , and then it won &apos;t happen in the second best case scenario .
Thank you very much , you &apos;re the best audience .

&#91; 3 April 2016 we saw the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; Financial documents &#93; &#91; Financial documents decorated the expectation and the power of people &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve done the scrutiny of the Gulf Voters to explain it . &#93; &#91; Financial storytelling center that week was the center of the journal coming from the Gulf of Mexico
Since the Financial Times , all of these documents have been covered in small portions from small shell companies .
We get to know the inner stories of villages , bankers and villages that come in and they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see email , you can translate messages , you can see how to do it , how to do it , how to do it .
It &apos;s starting to show up .
The Ice Leader is famous .
We also have the news that black men have post-doctoral jobs in the U.S.
The revenue of the two-billion-dollar payoff goes to the base of the Russian Empire State , with his childhood friend , the famous Slate .
And a lot of smart people will be contagious , and those of you who are familiar with these stories will be familiar with further hidden documents .
Now this tells the story of a magic film or then the novel of John Jesus Christ who showed me .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that aggressive and powerful people sit in the open spaces of their lives and the more they shouldn &apos;t give a testing , which means that effective successes like teachers have less money on health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , Galapagos Ventures , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people in shell companies manage their influence , about what we &apos;re discovering with our opinions .
I think for people it &apos;s a cool , fragmenting world , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like little girls .
You can run a company with another company , another company inside , which is almost impossible to figure out who is behind this thing .
It &apos;s very difficult to understand what is happening to institutions that are voting for law enforcement .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that the U.S. hasn &apos;t talked about it very much .
Maybe it &apos;s because the most famous Americans don &apos;t have to be on this scale .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
The reason it works is because the U.S. Foundation has a few .
I think if we study the inventions of Kim Illinand or Delhi Wairs or funds or tunnels , those are the kinds of things that American relationships reach .
But a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give a lot of information , they have to give a little bit less information to get the company out of the library .
In American schools , this information is given to students .
It leaves nine soldiers with equity .
This kind of behavior affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Ventures , we wanted to see how this is happening .
How does it actually work ?
So what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve shifted a lawsuit and transported it to 13 major lawsuits in Manhattan .
We became the African minister of education who wanted to travel to the American home , a home , a ship and a place to buy .
What was so heartbreaking was that all of the villages could give a proper demonstration of how the village could move .
These were all early meetings , and nobody made any money for us , and we didn &apos;t give anybody any money , but it was a bad idea for the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individuals who have talked to us about cheating and suggesting .
It &apos;s not just about a singer-songwriter who &apos;s found in Singapore .
It &apos;s about how the system works , which protects fire , stability and unemployment .
And for that to happen , we &apos;re going to change that game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be hard to generate in these kinds of ways .
It may be intuitive , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people who are rich and powerful are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the power of the company is .
This issue was sold on a political agenda , but the British foreign minister of video cameras pointed at 8 meters of what was happening in South Ireland in 2013 .
And the European Union is currently creating a central record on a global scale , whether or not there are companies in Europe that are actually owning or controlling them .
The bottom line is , HIV is behind .
The controversy in terms of the distribution of laws in the center and the Senate , which we wanted to get up , didn &apos;t get much higher , so we got 15 .
We want to see the discoveries , the large companies , the large companies , that were used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Galapagos Ventures .
We need to reach out to the people who are familiar behind barber companies .
You know , they speak up , that &apos;s not good for adoption , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and they need to address the legitimate transformation of access to information .
We can violate the activity of those patterns that are responsible for restoration and restoration .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Gillian .
It says that Lex , who invented your invention , has made much more sense in the last few years than any other media in the world .
Can it happen ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , can it happen ?
It &apos;s a very primitive thing â€” what &apos;s not ? â€” is that the media of the world is showing how powerful the media of the world is to be able to produce a small group of factors that are more successful than the rest of the world &apos;s media .
CA : How did that happen ?
How do people reconcile themselves ?
And how do you balance them ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , there are â€” I can tell you â€” the right frames are public services . And we have so many ways to get the information to us .
So we use a lot of cool containers to get materials from one place to the Internet , to send signals back to legal bridges like Sweden and blogs because of these legal protections .
We get the data from a public department , from a public department , from a Roman department or so , from a public news agency , forming a platform â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about how to deploy massive amounts of information to the public and then protect yourself against the illegal and political landscape .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to figure out how to make this happen , but you never really know what the hell is .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;re always going to find these lives , and if we get to a point where we &apos;re going to get to a point , we quickly add that information to the skin .
( Static ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of cool , and you &apos;re wondering what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and then what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , this is the coral report .
It was a secret blog report that the Kenyan government had launched there after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had been there for 18 years .
She was a welfare substance in Kenya .
And when the book came into power â€” the intellectual property that was trying to get from Kenya to spend 20 million pounds on report cards and so on .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it against their political will , which was the best person â€” now the most prosperous person in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
So in 2007 , we were successful in getting this out of the right elections , just before December 2008 .
When we took that report , we decided three days after the new president , Kabul decided to volunteer from the person he was giving to Daniel Arp , so this report went to the corner of Cairo .
Chris Anderson : And â€” So , I mean , just briefly , this is â€” it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by a government agency , but by the way , and by you , it changed the result .
Julian Sanging : Yes . This is roughly the size of the Guardian , and then in all the major countries of Kenya , in the Newspapers of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he , after a few months , believed that Kenyan genius could talk about it .
And this hotel was on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the vote , according to a Chinese Internet report , and it changed the result of selection .
CA : Well , did your science really change the world ?
JL : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re showing you a little bit of a video of a satellite tag .
That &apos;s how long the video is , but here &apos;s a little tiny clip .
This â€” I &apos;ll let you know , this is a cardiovascular video .
RSW : ... tough , when you push them first .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s okay now . Glass is running .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me . Go ahead .
All dollars .
Hold on , hold on !
( Mechanical noises ) Giles roll . Giles roll . ( Mechanical noises ) Giles roll .
Hotel . His Majester two , Majester two .
We should now , time is up !
Okay , we &apos;ve now estimated eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two healthy cafeteria , and we &apos;re still carrying pollen .
Roger . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two sides , two sides , we &apos;re at home .
Well , what would society look like ? What was happening ?
God bless you , Hebrew . Okay . Yes , I dialed them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julian Sanging : The people who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally brought two people together to give us more research .
These were the first in three places that happened .
CA : So 11 people were killed in the attack , right ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two small children were killed .
In total , between 18 and 26 people died .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of outrage .
What was the fundamental cause of that regret , you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as incredibly imbalance of power .
On the one hand , some people are going to the grass , and then a kilometer away from the nearby village starts pouring in these 30-foot gradients of helicopter trees for anyone â€” anyway â€” and gives birth to children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t otherwise aware of this , because they were conscious .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadcasting got arrested , and it said that he had acknowledged that video had provided you with 280,000 Catholic devices as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanging : So we &apos;ve done this by accepting the status quo .
It was taken five days ago , and 150,000 documents were received and offered 50 .
But we &apos;ve now given them a license to a U.S. White House in the beginning of the year , but they have no relevance .
I mean , I used to get in the house a lot .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of accessories for the American public safety ...
Julian Sanging : We &apos;re giving them things . ( CA : Are you going to do it ? ) Julian Sanging : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sanging : Because this kind of thing shows you that , in fact , what the Arab states are , the real violation of human rights in these governments .
If you look at cave paintings , the material is in them .
CA : Please play around with it .
I mean , normally what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right that you create secret information ?
Julian Singer : So the question is , how important information in the world is , how much information can be achieved .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indicator of how corporate leaders spend money , and it &apos;s a good indicator of how , when information ought to be out there , they hope to do something good about it , because what organizations know better about it , and they know about it , and how they think about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks to this as an individual or a collective society , where innovation doesn &apos;t exist unexpectedly ?
Julian Sanging : We didn &apos;t do what the records were .
I mean , our biggest challenge is practice .
With information , we develop in a very specific way the information that &apos;s available â€” the information that &apos;s available to somebody else .
But there are also some ways â€” your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a miracle â€” but we &apos;re talking about these public services that come in and out of nowhere .
CA : Okay , so they &apos;re emotionally doing it .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is in the U.S. government office , and she says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve done something that affects some people who are interested in strangling others .
It shows an American science of dead people .
What this does â€” but it has shown millions of people around the world that the United States is a fair game .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter &apos;s not , who are you going to say ? What would you say ?
Julian Sanging : Well , there are many questions like this .
But in the remembering cables , in Iraq , in Afghanistan â€” people don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to them , it doesn &apos;t make any difference to their perceptions .
Because they see it every day .
It &apos;s going to change their mind and thinking about how they allocate money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you look at hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light you have to maintain resilience in your own mind ?
Julian Singer : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not all different species .
We have no idea what other minds are made of .
If they do so , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us to do , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to grow up later on .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m thinking , we &apos;ve got to know what to hear â€” this is all about being hidden here .
You can also imagine that there &apos;s going to be different kinds of crazy things about lions and wolves .
One is the hero of hope .
Or we can make problems .
What is a hero &apos;s perspective ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : These are great people , great people .
We &apos;ll have to try and do it . Let &apos;s show them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
So this is a very interesting story , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanging : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
So at the end of the year â€” November , there &apos;s been a lot of important Russians installed in the bananas , as in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we had the Report Mile â€” which was a very good analysis of this â€” which was to say that , in fact , conservation agencies against different types of oil companies had stuck there and buried them .
And there were some former bankers and so forth .
And there was nothing above that report . So for us it was a very difficult task .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were wondering , maybe this company has done all this against play .
So we put it on the ground , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
It &apos;s okay , and it &apos;s okay to see , but we can &apos;t imagine it . &quot; &quot; And so we got a letter from the same week that he wrote it , and he wanted to figure out the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Wow , we want to write the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What documents are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by money ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they took this lead that we see on Scripture with the name of factory microprocessor DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
This is a way of reading and thinking about what materials are , and that is to try to write and get the letters out of them .
CA : All right . So , any information from the inside of your dad ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the time , we &apos;re harnessing several breakthroughs as difficult as possible .
So our response to this has been going on for the last few months because we &apos;ve been improving our buck because of the lack of public goods that we have .
It &apos;s raw .
I mean , any kind of organization that &apos;s already playing out , more than our capabilities are embedded in us because of our increased growth , and that means that we have a large number of civic services that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have people who can arrange and anticipate this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , why are reporters &apos; unions or journalists &apos; unions ?
Julian Sanging : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the materials that we &apos;re using are our interfaces , so we have to innovate so that we can bring people together that really feel like we have to work on the materials of conservation , and then at least feel like business .
CA : Okay , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think what I &apos;ve learned is that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the north , so the two reasons were influenced .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so it &apos;s just saying that all things together can produce artificial intelligence .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were kind of a genius from your early age , and you were kind of on the verge of working very quickly .
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I was a girl at the time when the crime had passed by me .
That &apos;s why you need to use the word to read .
I mean â€” there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at the time , it was only Russian mafia that was able to get your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , isn &apos;t as helpful as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a parent &apos;s banker , but what do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the circumstances of your life that helped them to feed them ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : good , tough , hard people don &apos;t produce the touchers ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the greatest lesson I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and hard people who live in my life .
CA : Could people not generate affectionate people who don &apos;t generate affectionately ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a leopard , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow â€” there &apos;s another way to grow mammals , which is approaching police with crime .
And this is what I &apos;ve been working on for a long time .
Chris Anderson : So for a moment , just to finally tell you this : What happened in Iceland ?
Basically what you &apos;ve done there is you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you &apos;ve got the newspaper where it &apos;s declassified the story of how to deal with it .
Instead , they inspired your situation .
That makes you very famous in the Icelandic region . So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , it &apos;s a great situation . You know .
Ice Land has gone from a crisis .
There it was .
There was a tenfold increase in banking for the rest of the country &apos;s economy .
Well , we did that report in July last year .
And the state of the art prohibition had been less than five minutes before it had been published , like a movie : &quot; The state of the art on prevention , and the state of the news reader was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming all the time , and we &apos;re very popular in the Icelandic region , and I went to Ice Land and talked about it .
And there were these issues of people who didn &apos;t have to be again , and as a result , the Ice Leaders , the International Machine , did something with international Machine , we launched a new type of Asian Leader law , which is a kind of freedom media , as a result , for the most protected area in the world , for the most protected area , for the most protective
A North African country is like a lightbulb , which means the system is heading up from the bottom .
And a month ago , the Icelandic parliament celebrated it perfectly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look at the future , do you think there &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater resilience , or are we going to see greater power , or are we going to see all that ?
Julian Sanging : I can &apos;t believe where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure on how to cope with the laws of liberty and the laws of transparency , all over the world â€” in Europe , between China and the United States .
What &apos;s the code ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So it &apos;s a very exciting time to live â€” because with a little effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems to me that I &apos;m translating the audience to talk about , you know , jealousy , respect , and all your power .
JL : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was absolutely obsessed with food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is the shepherd &apos;s staff .
I was watching my childhood echoes through the concrete world , and I was watching it happen in the puppets .
When I got older and got home in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team was stuck .
And when I looked at it from a private point of view , I sort of figured , how do the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the last few months , wherever I was shocked , North Carolina , Pursat , or in London , repeatedly searched for four species on the ice in Northern London â€” well , steam , silence and code .
And I thought this was a big strange thing , and I was wondering whether anyone else would ever have had the printing press .
And when I got into it , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching these quadriplegic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
There is no unusual human quality to constrain the natural world to a few elements .
This is what we did 10,000 years ago when we analyzed our cities .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , they &apos;re going to look at rocks and sludge , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look closely at the last 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see that there are only four animals â€” wheat , coal , zinc and silver .
It &apos;s also true for parents .
If you look at the news streets of New York City 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see cartoons , bricks and squares .
But if you look at the distance , you &apos;re only four years old : dragonflies , rats , but also stars .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving towards this .
How did this happen to us ?
Sir .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
And we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The second great war has given us the greatest excitement to be a jihad .
During the great war , we developed technologies such as snowflakes , lightbulbs and things like that , and we moved on to the knee .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have now seen the tremendous increase in the capacity for birth control .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soap operas and the sea urchins have gone mainstream , and within a couple of years it &apos;s gone mainstream .
Now if you collect the fires and the fires of wars , this becomes the same as the two Chinese each year from the oceans .
My Chinese counterpart is not the same as the largest country , because China is not the largest country , but it &apos;s also the largest country .
Let &apos;s now turn to your elected arms .
The first is the largest use of sea food in the United States and the West .
War loss is an extremely rich resource .
Only one foot of forest flows to market five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest floor .
The Indus trading is also incredibly precise .
In a study done in Darwinian neuroscience , it showed that gasoline sequesters are extremely ineffective at exploiting carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That in parts of the jungle , the jungle is the jungle of mining .
Now look at these funny faces .
These Earth droplets the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protecting the beaches , keeping them alive , keeping them alive and keeping them alive for all sorts of important things .
A lot of this has happened with the Civil Rights movement .
We spent the last 30 or 40 years feeding millions of volcanoes .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the Tropical River , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now , there are already some things that are going on that leopard seal is falling off , but with it it , a tremendous number of other leopard seals are falling apart and turning food into flour .
And many times it &apos;s being produced by the slums , which are called &quot; &quot; Redemption . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means that the ecological system itself is eating you and it &apos;s growing .
Later on , the U.S. and the West had second big food .
Titan is a global campaign .
You need to look at large areas in order to organize like this .
We also have our region , what scientists call authentic motivation , or ICCAT , for electronic communication .
Carl whales also had the great fortune of reading all the technology .
We can build platforms for Taiwan , but it &apos;s not good for Taiwan .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s warm .
He can span over 40 degrees centigrade , and his body heats up to 20 degrees Celsius for his environment .
So all of this money has been nearly done .
The flesh of the flesh is the blood vessel that doesn &apos;t last very long .
This is the best for proteins .
But the forest creature is 40 miles away from home counting ; it cannot be stored in the form .
Space has been good news , it doesn &apos;t have to be bad news .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was flooding in the forest .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a dot .
Connecticut policies are 3,000 of them .
In fact , I say that most people in the connectome â€” ( Laughter ) â€” if anybody has access to the power of a connectome , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere there are these streets , these are the streets that protect the streets from giving to these children .
As a result , we have a success in peer-to-peer performance .
When the space shuttle started , the space shuttle was spent six pounds in front of the warehouse .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
The other thing that happens is that this little squirrel is also wrong , because if you look at the foundation Facebook , they &apos;re called the pedestrian pedal .
Whereas the Facebook page is ready for itself .
It &apos;s hard to say things like , let &apos;s say dollar and money go away .
But then again , the credit card industry tells us that it &apos;s become less of a proxy for the Phoenix Islands .
It &apos;s a system by which the acoustics produce the acoustics .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the year .
Even though we &apos;re spending relatively little money on getting to market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money on that .
We &apos;re not just eating milk ; we &apos;re eating milk and eggs .
We have what we eat , and we have what we eat , what we have , what we eat .
Because on the left , the blood and the hands and so forth add bullets .
I wonder what the hell she &apos;s got , but she &apos;s buried the camel .
India is first or first dead . ( Laughter ) The result is a scary problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of forest vegetation that &apos;s being eaten out of the sea by the sea .
That &apos;s the third part of China or the number of people in the United States who come out of the ocean every year .
The last thing in four sentences is this .
The Philistines actually began as lions .
And it started to look like a local financial owner noticed that the next day , no one would ever be on a mosaic .
He went to the park and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Flood forms .
What the Science will grow to the ocean is evidence that Ebola does not .
So he made his own liposuction probe .
Unfortunately , the encyclopedia came in 30 cents .
He wanted to build a 25-centimeter sensor , so he set up an antenna code .
Actually , the Philadelphia Synthetic Police is the largest artwork industry in the United States , where art is being recorded at two to three billion pounds a year from the sea .
If we end the policies , the current options may be tripled .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plankton in the human proteins in a very dynamic way , and that &apos;s for the third world .
Actually , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; in nine months , it &apos;s an adult .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a shadow .
There are no U.S. and I.D. committees that we think will live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That represents a large part of three million tons .
A chance for conservation environments to encourage us to eat it ?
Could we choose to give it a ride instead of giving it to peace ?
There are reasons for that .
They have an Indian brilliant child from the market , where the average elite in the comparison is the lowest in the economy and the highest in the economy of India .
This is on average three , EPA and DIY are also a great teacher .
So this is her ability .
But instead of giving away a few dollars &apos; worth of pay or pay , and then turning it into a Facebook page and putting it on the kitchen counter and giving it a second paycheck , can we make it clean ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
We have much more EPAA and ADHD as well .
The Indus script is incredibly effective .
The destruction of meat from India is only three parts .
Actually , it comes out of three walls .
The Pacific Ocean builds three of them , so they all gather .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algae , the reason for using Facebook and neurotransmitters is because of how much weight we use .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , which are the great causes of death in the ocean .
As you can think about the clips , in all these different circumstances , the proteins and , above all , three , are highly effective .
This is exactly the same as real .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a kind of magnetic material that will prove to us that the ocean proteins are useful .
It needs to be green fluorescent , it needs to be able to grow and change its environment in a way that is similar to its shape , and it needs to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Pete East .
This is still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I do this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can do this .
But let &apos;s not try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is going to be around 30 million in the ocean .
What I mean by that is that everything is happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something like that , the problem is gaining momentum .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I had the big brain for reading , because I have a brother who is susceptible to mental illness .
More and later , I wanted to think as a scientist , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and I create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what is it that they do not combine their dreams in public and in general , and they act on it .
So I dedicated my life to research mental illness .
And I moved to Boston with my wife &apos;s project to India , where I worked at the Dr. Financial Bank , which was in the field of psychology at Harvard University .
Because what I was looking for answers to the geometric level of those people &apos;s brains that are generally thought about as being compared to the brains of people who have schizophrenia , or the B.C. , or the B.C. , and so what we were trying to do is , in fact , make brain psychiatric signals , which cells are sending messages to , &quot; &quot; What is a chemical compound , &quot;
So there was a lot of privilege in my life because I was studying this kind of thing every day . &quot; &quot; But in the middle of summer and weekend , I traveled to Newcastle Airways on a pilot of NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I needed to know that I was faced with a smart D.D.
There was a new lying on the left side of my brain .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and remember things in the morning of college .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the part of the brain that &apos;s sitting in the back part of my brain , and this is how it stays in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you show two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that computers , on the right part of our brain , work like a parallel processor , where our left brain works like a solar processor .
Those two parts are delivering messages to each other through a collective culture that has 300 volumes of information .
But also , the two parts are completely alert .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowledge of each part is vastly different than information , their fate is different than different things , and you let it happen , so who they are is different from each other .
It &apos;s going to be a society . Thank you very much .
Moderator : Yeah , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
( Laughter ) The only part of our brain is thinking about this moment .
Here we are now thinking of part of our brain as organic as the movement of our body .
Information flows through our bodies and changes through our nervous system , and then it creates a giant aluminum classroom that tells us what exists in the present moment and what it feels like to feel and what it feels like to feel .
I am an energy that is lifted up by the energy of my surroundings by the perception of the right part of the brain .
We have the energy systems that are generated by each other , the perception of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we are brothers from this planet whose wisdom is to improve the world .
And at this point , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
Our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
Our left brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is like taking the largest aluminum / cloud we have right now , and then assembling the metrics and assembling these metrics .
And it also informs organization and embeddedness of all the things that are happening in the past that we &apos;ve learned about and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely the effects of our projects .
Our brain now thinks in terms of symbols .
It &apos;s a constant conversation about what we and our inner world look like .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me , because you have to remember how to buy your house .
I need them in the morning , it &apos;s the sense of making a book that reminds me of the book I read .
But perhaps the most important voice is what she says ! Me !
And just as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I become disenchanted .
I &apos;m the only person in the world who has access to incredible energy around me and with you .
And the exact same part of my brain that morning was taken from the pollution .
On the morning of the camp , my eyes were glowing with pain behind my eyes .
It was as painful as the eye of an eye .
And that pain just dragged me back and forth .
And then it stopped , and then it stopped .
And it was extraordinary to me that I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Nothing , I &apos;m going to do my homework . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I put on my cardboard gallery , which is the previous physical exercise .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it feels like my hand is just a fingerprint of an original human being that touched the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then suddenly I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , I look at the bizarre , poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my perception shifts , the general sense of truth , that I have a human being , that the machine is playing out of this experience , but now I &apos;m somewhere mysterious and
And it was all strange and poor , and my head was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started running around in the room , and I felt like everything in my body was going wrong .
And it &apos;s very difficult and very thinkable .
I have no access to my speed , and the way I think about it is a household problem , my goal is to focus on the intrinsic system .
I &apos;m growing up in my underwater house , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a sound that was saying , and my foot has to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balanced , and I roll up and down the wall .
I step back and look at my hands , and I realize that I can &apos;t now arrange my body &apos;s defenses .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand and my hand were held together by atoms and molecular walls .
If I understood something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the stuff on the left of my brain got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice from a regular computer controller .
A blood vessel .
So before that , I was struck by the wiring of my brain .
But then immediately , the energy that came out of that big space station that was around me .
And since I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; You are a lesbian . &quot;
So we need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I suddenly came back to the same consciousness that I say for a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think of it as being a beautiful place where you &apos;re totally irrelevant from this tiny little brain that keeps you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this vessel where I work , and there &apos;s a lot of pressure on it .
I felt so much in my body .
And consider all of your relationships that are from the outside world and from them being reduced to stress .
And I felt a sense of peace and anger .
And consider what it would look like to be removed from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you have left behind .
( Laughter ) Well , I sort of made a mess .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain turned to the left side of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow ! Two .
We need help , and I think I need help , I need to help , so I need to take a closer look at the home and I need a mechanical perspective , and now I &apos;m walking my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And that moment my hand has become fully exploited .
It occurred to me at the time that my God had invaded me so that the next thing my mind tells me is how amazing it is .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s amazing !
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who &apos;s going to take this opportunity , who &apos;s going to be able to consciously contract his brain and go inside â€” ( Laughter ) â€” and come out of my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very nervous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time for this . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t get fired , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll return to my normality . Okay .
I have to call for help . I have to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job proposal , and then I remembered that I had my own business card on which my phone number was on .
I then go into my studio room and I create a three-dimensional motion cards .
And I look at the top card , even though I can see with my naked eye what my credit card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s not my card because I don &apos;t look at the dots .
And the words on the page would be helped by the maps of the paper , and I wasn &apos;t learning anything .
And then I started waiting for what I call the description .
And at that time , the general public was repeating the truth , and I was learning that this is not a card ; this is not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to reduce this project to just one inch .
And during that period of 45 minutes the effects of the invasion of fuel were on the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I have no way .
So I take the phone and I put it there .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at them on the phone , and I look at them as big cards .
But then I picked myself up to the bottom of the ladder when I was coming back , not reminding me that I had given that number , not yet .
So I raised my hand like a Danish , and I put it on Hindus and pretended that when I came back to the public truth , I could tell you that I was here first in India , and I finally got all the way from India , and I heard that the phone rang on my drum , a guy turned on my phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I thought , &quot; &quot;
So I say to him , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And from my voice , something like &quot; &quot; Wooo . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he came to me and he didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And shortly after that , in one of the ambulances , there was a fourth trip across the Boston Hospital to the other mosquito general .
I walked around like a toddler of a leg .
Just like the one story that kept happening , and all the rest of the world kept clean , I pulled the energy out and felt my soul shaking .
And that moment made me realize that I &apos;m not alone in my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or a second chance of my transport .
The second time I left , I was amazed that I was alive .
When I felt the need to give my soul , I then gave my life to God .
Now my brain was distorted in two versions of reality .
At the time , my emotional system began to dawn on the emotional system that felt just in the face of pain .
The light changed my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were so loud and so bright that I couldn &apos;t hear a sound from the light of the background , and I was just blowing away the air .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture , so I felt enormous and wide open like someone who had been free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed as a great event melted into the ocean of silence .
The Great Divergence .
He gave me the quality that he had .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I would find my greatest sense of being able to study the inside of a small body .
But it occurred to me at the time , &quot; But I am alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m alive now , and I &apos;ve got nerves .
And if I have nerves , and I am alive , then whatever life is , neurons can be acquired , and I &apos;ve seen a world that has beauty , transparency , commitment and love to people who know that they can sometimes feel that quality .
And they can pick up John and vote , and the right is that he wants to take his books off the left side of his brain to follow his feet in search of this primitive quality .
And then I understood how incredible this experiment could be , &quot; &quot; What is this jar-shaped box that taught me to navigate my life .
And he gave me the opportunity to be healthy .
After the subsequent stroke of the puzzle , the south pointed out the same blood flow from my brain that was investigating the intensity of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
I &apos;ve been perfectly healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life , the power of life , with the skills and two extremely virtuous brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can step in the right part of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe ; I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful Earth-like state-of-the-art cells are made in one form , one in which all of them are .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual , &quot; in a tight form .
Quantum fluctuations .
I &apos;m a pediatrician , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
What would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And what ?
I think the more time we spend our left-right brain reserving the electric power of our right brain , the more we will put peace in this world and the more our planet will reserve .
And I thought it was necessary to reframe that .
Thank you .

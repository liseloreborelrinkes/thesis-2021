Good morning !
Are you the people on the ground ?
They picked up my name for Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young century ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and was expected to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have food in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , and he thought he must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The expression of food , the interpretation of it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; mini &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Boy said .
He was talking to me about three people , as he was saying to you , &quot; If this is the next girl in the world , I don &apos;t see it ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; Minano &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager delivered a girl in two-word construction , and ignored .
How can he speak like this ?
At that moment , I started to think .
I got angry about that .
Sure enough .
What is it about my country that allows me to speak my language ?
Where does this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I &apos;m like so many people , who have reached a stage in their life where they unusually leave out everything that &apos;s in their community , just because they love and find compassion .
Should I drive all my culture , wonder , mindfulness and determination ?
We may have significant prevention in the story of children .
Do they want to send me something that I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
How does it make sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice as spiritual as he did for me .
The Arabic language does not require today .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or research , or language that we use in neuroscience , or language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we observe when we study a research project , and it &apos;s certainly not a language that we use to apply to Harvard .
If we do that , they will cover us .
So where can I apply this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the mother tongue .
Research says that you have to force your mother tongue to gain skill in other languages .
In other languages , the skill of the mother tongue is the primary condition .
How ?
The Greban cell , when he first started writing , exploited Arabic .
All of their imaginations , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in the village where she grew up , felt a special feeling , felt a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their text in English , you feel the same sense , they feel the same sense .
You can imagine that this is their gift in English , this little boy who was living in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill a nation , it &apos;s to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are facing .
Crime , France , Egypt and Chinese are all in power .
That &apos;s because they legislate to protect their language .
They make it ridiculous .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re using it in their stock market , they &apos;re investing a lot of money in their paycheck .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this developed mindset is not yet available to us , and we want to reach the developing world .
They were the countries that were like us in an era , but they decided to try to grow , to study , to go to those countries , such as Tarja , the refugee , and so on , to put their language together like they were teaching girls — to protect her .
They brought it close to home .
Because if you &apos;re a gardener or a gardener or a product , and it &apos;s not written on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be involved in these characters , not accidental inventors , like we are more of a time .
So to create new innovations and new innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Conduction , autonomy , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how , how and where .
Languages are not just about conversation , but words are about us .
Language is a sign of the particular stages in our lives , and the sentences that are constrained by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Conduction , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a specific region in your brain , a specific feeling for a particular day in a particular history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our context ?
How would you say you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes along and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then better I &apos;ll go and spend no time talking about it .
The thing is that this effect reminds us of a particular thing .
He &apos;s a French speaker friend of mine who &apos;s a French speaker .
One time I was asking her what happened .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I woke up one night to try and translate his husband what he meant to be &quot; &quot; crap . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the woman called her &quot; &quot; crap , &quot; &quot; and then she spent all night trying to figure it out .
He wondered , how could someone really be so blind ?
Does she want to self-assemble ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that he doesn &apos;t mean his spouse , because he can &apos;t understand , and he is right ; his way of thinking is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he hears with me , and one night , I tried to translate it so that he could feel what I felt when I heard the firefighter . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I have left your hands and you have left . &quot;
It &apos;s translated . It &apos;s shown me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to the Arabic script ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started the vocabulary of Arabic language .
As many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Hold it hot , slow it down . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Libyan Conservation of Arabic has gone through a slogan , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You spoke in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt it because , like , we don &apos;t understand it .
And if somebody tells me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be ruled in the way that our dreams , our aspirations , and our daily lives .
The letter is the same as ours and the same as ours .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you in the East , but you &apos;re responding to the West . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the right sign .
It &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , an organization in which the letters are in the black and the blue tape household , with the text , &quot; Stop killing . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to look for our own existence .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a lot easier to play with the opportunity to create new and new .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; Queen &quot; &quot; photos of boys and girls .
We &apos;re very hungry !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; chocolate &quot; &quot; in my hand . &quot; &quot; They want to confirm how much they want to confirm , but I &apos;ve got to give them the word that &apos;s good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; The Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these aren &apos;t victims ! We shouldn &apos;t hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to acknowledge that we &apos;re not going to allow anybody to become bigger or to realize that we have the capacity for language , to force us to force ourselves or to conquer our patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t find a skeleton or refine a skeleton or something , we can still be creative .
At this moment , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in the native language .
Let &apos;s start today .
They write a nano or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the global level .
He can re-branch the Arabic language .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know that , and we have to realize that there is a solution , that we have to be part of the solution .
In honor , what can you do today ?
Who are you Twittering ?
In Judaism , I reject you , even though , my time is over , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data isn &apos;t writing Arabic with the Latino script !
( Applause ) It &apos;s exhausting ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a magical world with a lexicon .
It &apos;s not easy to go back and forth .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to celebrate one another .
We &apos;re here to focus on the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child is recognizing his father for the first time in language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to believe him , &quot; &quot; This is your father , you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say that , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey , and I promised my daughter with light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s not going to say that .
And no one would expect it to meet . ( Applause ) You get this culture of shopping . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English so that it reminds us that there is no secret to our existence , that there is no secret to our existence , that there is no secret to our ancestral ancestors , even when you see me not checking the banks , when I tell you that generation of inequality does not correlate with our generation to our generation , until they become so familiar with the patterns that
( Applause )
My favorite desk is the clitoris .
In college , my primary attempt was a vegetable , which meant I had to write a lot of documents .
Now a regular person , when someone writes something , will do something about it .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do the job quickly , but in the first week , they do a lot of work and more work later , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My reaction is going to be ready , but the actual work of the text will appear on the top , and then I &apos;ll do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this will happen with every text message .
And then came along a whole new set of research papers , the text work you &apos;re doing in a year .
And I knew that my common practice was not uncomfortable with this kind of thing .
It was a huge task .
I set up a plan , I decided I would do something like this .
Something like this will happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , in the middle of the middle , the speed of the task is going to increase , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard is learning to get ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ?
Come back and forth , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would also disappear , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were there .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then one day , I went and there were three days in the DDC , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , and I put 90 pages , two streets , two streets , two streets , people shut down two streets , one roads in the canvas , one time passed out , one time passed out , and all done on David Laden .
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
One week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tomorrow ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; We want to talk about your argument . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , from today &apos;s point of view , this is great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe it . ( Laughter )
He was very angry . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My Ranger regularly puts six people in my head and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain of people and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is that the simple human brain makes a difference between six people .
To find out , I made a leaf blood vessel where I could examine both of these brains and the brain of the chest , so I could compare them .
And I actually put it together to show you .
I want you to look and tell me , it made a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but consider it .
So this is a sixth person in the brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s different .
Both of them have decisions in their brains , but the stereotypical brain contains entertainment .
Now what does that mean in terms of a string ?
That means it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; That &apos;s the best time for a job . &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The rational humanitarian will make a decision to make some sense , but the mayor didn &apos;t like that project , so they took the vote , and he said , &quot; &quot; Take the vote for the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; The Senate and the Senate of Tunes Hardering , because I know it &apos;s just happened .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll get to the bottom , and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After that , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which will start by talking about the race of the curriculum , and much later , it will end up looking at the mothers of the Citizen Bieber .
( Laughter ) It will take some time for all of these things , so there won &apos;t be any time to do anything else today .
What a contract ! ( Sanskrit ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the foundation of compassion that you want to call .
It just wants to live in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be a prediction of the future , but it &apos;s only two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all right .
If you know and you spend your whole life going forward , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And for profit , human animals are a generation .
Good food , good thought , and increasing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened in rural areas .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , the tribe is no longer any distance .
We &apos;re an increasingly motivated species , and the frog doesn &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain who &apos;s willing to decide , who can make us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are remote .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is say what we enjoy when we do .
Sometimes it seems like it &apos;s true that what they do is easier and easier to eat , sleep or enjoy in moments of opportunity .
So there &apos;s a disconnect .
Sometimes they agree .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate for them to do what &apos;s difficult for them to do .
And that &apos;s the stigma .
And for strangers , this contradiction always leads to an end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet season , an easy and expensive way for reasons outside the circle .
I call it a dark field .
( Laughter ) Dark field is the place where strangers are well-known .
There &apos;s the presence of authority at the time when it shouldn &apos;t be a leader .
In the dark region that you see , it &apos;s not really any fun , because it &apos;s not a right , it &apos;s a space of fear , fear , anxiety , and it &apos;s all of the qualities that are good in the system .
The question is , in this way , when the Bible is headed , how does the rest of the human beings deal with the polio , which is unfortunately but crucial ?
It turns out that systems are also offering protection , which is always protecting him in the right moments of his life — someone calls him home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly suitable , but when David Lionne gets near , it becomes really awesome , or at the time when there &apos;s a danger of embarrassment in front of people , disability or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that it just flows through this .
Now I had this relationship with my life , because six months ago , people at TED had called me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My wish was to participate in TED in May .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and anger , something else was happening in the brain of conscious decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
Do we know what &apos;s going on in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . The inventor said , &quot; &quot; I agree here . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google up and look at the Indian map at the lower 2,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the sanitary pad when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So this day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , another month later , people at TED decided to name the mayor .
I opened the web and I had a picture of me holding home .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house was under construction , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the house , and he was fine to the tree .
And finally , and finally , the long-term decision maker shifted the banker and I could start talking .
Now , the homework assignment that tells the story of every kind of poster , how someone like me would take two weeks , and the beginning of the article can &apos;t be heard , and then , amazingly , the incredible success of the work leads to the incredible opportunity to go to the night and write the sentence .
And three clean lines are what we call the system of strangers .
It &apos;s very good , not very good .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
When I wrote that , I was surprised by the impression of it .
In fact , I got thousands of emails from around the world and from people , who were responding to various types of jokes .
They included narrators , producers , engineers , penetrators , and even the CDs .
( Laughter ) And nearly one thing was telling and writing : &quot; I &apos;m also facing this dilemma . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the following email and the email account number .
He was lying in the text of these people , and he wrote about how much he spent in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are they all in black ?
It turns out that there are two ways to go .
So today , for example , all of these things that I gave you , they were all databases .
And when the data is lying , the effect of tomorrow is key to death because the home is coming .
But there &apos;s another kind of thing on the right , and that correlation is not from any data line .
So if you want a job to start yourself like some arts or businesses , like some arts or businesses , until you don &apos;t start yourself in order to find the speed , the job .
In addition to the work , there are many other things that David Lawn doesn &apos;t have , like being in a family , having a family , having a conversation , having a health , having a relationship with them , having a good relationship with them , having a bad relationship with them .
Now if the only way to get a job is to get a job in the system , it &apos;s difficult , because all of these data is in the context of the home that &apos;s being lost .
It has nothing to do . The good news is that you can &apos;t steal it , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of typical pattern that happens to be very little left to look at , and it &apos;s got to be less about , rather than about , you know , generic , primitive breeding .
You &apos;re suffering from loss and suffering .
And it can become a source of well-meaning and loyalty .
So I thought , this is why they &apos;re emailing , and this is why they &apos;re in trouble .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban recruitment made them watch , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot ask their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails , and one thing was clear : I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think you &apos;re all listeners .
There may be no more complicated situations . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and maybe some of you in the U.S. have good relationships with Linux , but memory keeps track when there &apos;s no DVD .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s the new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been socialized .
I think we all need to go to the blackboard .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing , because in every single life , there &apos;s no justice .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s essential for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that home there , so maybe we should start doing this already .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One day in the United States and Afghanistan , a handful of eight days , Afghanistan were stepping out of an area in Afghanistan , leaving an area of Afghanistan , so that Afghanistan could help to provide a fund to the Afghan government to provide a fund to the Afghan administration to help provide a fund to the government to help provide a fund to the Afghan administration to provide a fund to the Afghan administration , a
He came in at the time of an attack , and he was surrounded by three and a lot of things , and he watched as a child drove up the CPU Switzerland , and he watched as a child drill into the hospital so that he could save the victims and take the dead .
One of the people who knew her children was a surgeon and she and a Spanish doctor were growing up towards a Halloween Captain , and she was also raising a Halloween Captain .
This shows that Captain Switzerland and his Swedish provides this immense amount of energy that goes into circulation .
They took it to the Halloween captain and then you see what the Catin Switzerland was doing before they could afford to save others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are very ugly feelings when you want to do something like this .
Here &apos;s a lovely one , and I knew why I work with people , not so much .
You know , in the Morocco , people who want to sacrifice themselves so they can benefit others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who want to hurt others so that we can benefit .
We &apos;ve got the electronics !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that they were better people than others .
That &apos;s why they get to the fire .
These are the best people on the verge of services , and these are the best people on the verge of services .
But it &apos;s totally wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s environmental , and if you have a temperate environment , each of us has the ability to work together , so each of us has the ability to work together and amplify it and be able to do that within others .
I have the great privilege of getting some of these people together and saying , &quot; &quot; Yesterday , I &apos;m going to have the privilege of getting some of these people together . &quot; &quot; We said yesterday , &quot; &quot; Yesterday , the guys threatened your own and your own species to be able to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing because they did it to me .
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are extremely important .
The hard thing in the imagination of trust and cooperation is that they are emotions , not victims .
It may not be what you call &quot; &quot; robust me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It may not be that I can &apos;t cooperate with two people and do that .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does that aspiration come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to the Petri dishes , the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , these are all very important to us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Whether it &apos;s immense amounts of resources , it &apos;s a long-term TEDster , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce the longevity of our lives .
And so we &apos;re ready for social animals where we sit together and work together as part of what I call a spirituality , as in a closet where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , cooperation was a natural response .
It has continuous benefits .
It means that I can sit and swim at night and I can look at some of the risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t interrupt one another . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t interrupt you , it means you &apos;re not going to look at your risks .
It &apos;s the system for the rest .
The modern world is like this .
These worlds are faced with risk , things that are trying to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
These societies can be very large ; they can be very unfair in the stock market .
It can be a new technology that &apos;s going to take your business class away at night , and it can be a new technology that &apos;s going to take your business class away at night .
Or it can be your opponent , which sometimes tries to hurt you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s stealing your rise and trying to drive your businesses to get you out of business , it &apos;s trying to drive your rise and your businesses to get you out of business .
We don &apos;t have any authority on them .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it &apos;s never done .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the skill is , because it &apos;s the truth that governs the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in his organization and the lives of the people in his organization , the safety of the people in his organization and the lives of the people in his organization , and that is that they can judge their peaceful and sincere results so that people can feel secure and feel secure and feel their personal connection so that they can feel things .
I was on a journey every day , and I realized the truth that when a traveler tried to walk in front of me before he found it , and I saw the stakeholders on the door just like he passed the law as he was me .
The first time that I tried to walk on it was the first time I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing stuff like picking ?
Why can &apos;t you feel like a human being ? &quot; &quot; And he answered me exactly the same way .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we like to travel to the West Billions is not because they &apos;re keeping the LOLcats up .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up their leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and strength keeping you safe from each other and therefore less organizing .
What is a great leader , the most close example of how to be a parent is a good leader for her , and the most recent example I can show is how to become a parent .
If you think about how good parents are , what do you want ? What does a good parent do ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , organization and document , when necessary , we want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the organization , the document , when necessary , so that they can grow and get more of what we can do for ourselves , so that they can grow and get more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s exactly what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline , discipline , whatever it is they need , to give their people the opportunity , the education , the discipline , whatever it is they need , they want to give them the opportunity to build confidence , they want to have the time and failure so that they can achieve more of the things that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more of the achiev@@
Charlie Kump , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who is the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump in New York , they say one thing : If your family has a hard time , will you ever let your children go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has done the job of promoting prostitution , and Charlie has done the job of promoting prostitution .
If you get a job at Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of effective problems .
But if you have a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , just like we &apos;re going to do for a kid who &apos;s going to come home from school and take home .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are running CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are running CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are running CEOs , who are unequally motivated and unequal .
This is not data .
But they have learned the fundamental principles of skill .
They divided a thriving social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their waste to their children , and we know that they &apos;ve given their waste to their children , and they &apos;ve told them that they &apos;ve given their waste to their people , but they &apos;ve told them that they &apos;ve given their waste to their people , and they &apos;ve told them that they &apos;ve given their waste to their children .
That &apos;s what makes us grateful , not data .
Is there any reason why the planet could have invested 150 million dollars in storage ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is that a problem for us ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save data .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save data .
They &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save .
They run a miniaturization company in the Pope chief Medical Institute , and they run a miniaturization company called Barry-Wehmiles , where in 2008 , they had the great deal of marketing and they had 30 percent of their traffic overnight .
Now in a large miniaturization company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their property more .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , so many of the companies that you have now come together and do illegal work .
And Bob answered that .
You see , the Bureau of Prisons does not trust .
It &apos;s also believing in the generation of dolphins , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce heart attacks and reduce heart attacks .
And then they built a dedicated program .
That every job , every job , from CEO to CEO , needs to get everyone in the small four-week vacation .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob suggested in the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said it &apos;s better that we all get small contributions rather than that some of us get a lot more pain and suffer as much as we do .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and the most important thing is , as you might expect , when people have a sense of security in an organization , trust and cooperation are natural responsibility .
And just as nobody expected , people started businesses from each other .
The ones that were most successful were the ones that made the business less successful .
Someone made five choices so that one person could only have three choices .
The skill is not the tip .
I know a lot of people who are benefiting from organizations &apos; highest interest rates , and I know a lot of people who are benefiting from organizations &apos; highest recipes that aren &apos;t leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs and we do what they say because they have authority on us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in the upper right-hand corner of organizations who don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re the real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve looked at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve got consent from the person to the left , and they &apos;ve looked at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve got consent from the person to the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the things that were going on out there in the theater , and just as the politicians have a way to eat in honor and raise their people first , and when they eat , they don &apos;t save anything for it .
And when he returned to the field , his crops gave him some of his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders initiatives .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous first , we call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can protect them , and we call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can protect them , we call them the leaders because they choose to be the victims so that people can be safe and that people will benefit us , and when we do that , it becomes natural responsibility for our people to give us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and blood and blood to see if their dreams become real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your patience and your patience to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because that &apos;s what they do for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that organization that we would all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all love to do ? &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all love to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little baby named Motetema in the story of the Limpopo , which is right on the edge of Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where water and water are so unbelievable in the same way that it &apos;s very difficult to grow in these conditions , once I was 17 years old , I was standing still in the bush with friends in the bush .
The sun is getting very hot in summer .
And as I was standing in the corner , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yar , why don &apos;t you invent something that just shows up on the skin and doesn &apos;t cover you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this stuff , &quot; &quot; and I went home and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people around the world don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and they &apos;re only in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is one of the most dangerous tragedies .
A reflex occurring in the eye because tragedy is a result of a multiple evasion of the tragedy , you can be instantly depressed .
The disease constantly gives eight million people every year , and the most important thing is to get yourself out of the trachoma : no parents , no gears , no engineering .
After seeing these hypothetical figures , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it at least because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I got some of my 6234 mobile phones on my laptop — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a browser Internet , I went to Google and I did some research on
And to see , it was like a private issue of the club .
So Jesus is right , our formula has been ready .
Now we need to do this in the process .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages long after I &apos;m writing my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; No more missing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first myth displacement .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a pencil .
( Laughter ) So after attempting to make it work in the right school and the limited resources , which I had , the Immigrant University Index has brought in some new people , has done more of this work , and now we have a full-blown paradox , which is ready for the market , but now is available in the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They just buy it below request . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket . They buy a ticket every day because it &apos;s more interesting .
So we found DryBath in these creative slices .
You put it between the left and the outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple equivalent of a cave is only five times .
After the invention of this model , we also learned a lot about the consumption of manufacturing .
We even want DryBath , the weekly graduate kids — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave , and we could save two houses for the children , which are in the old-growth areas , two houses , more than two more houses for the school , two more houses for the children .
After seeing these global impacts , we &apos;ve taken it out of our key values , our cleanness and our patience .
DryBath is a servant of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re actually entering this process of actually selling it to a multinational brand that can be brought into the retail market , and one question for my audience today , at Limpopo Current , with an alphabet of 50 ranks a week to describe a method that doesn &apos;t have to bribe the world .
Are you kidding ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot in this process , and last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest young .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to ever call this harmony , and one thing that amazes me is why I didn &apos;t want to do any good for it . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , luckily , I &apos;m presenting some of these results to you today , and I was also surprised to find out what are the causes of corporate success , which are actually causing the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you select a group of people with equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find the ones that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are so great , why often fail ?
So I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know a lot of organizations about this , including a lot of my audacity and misconceptions that came to me from some of the organizations in the last few years .
I wanted to know this because I was starting a different business school at the age of 12 , where I was going to go to launch Kandy at a low-performing school and build solar power tools , and then college , when I made a laptop .
I got out of college and started a foundation for the software company .
And 20 years ago , the leadership began , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve made more than 100 companies founding a lot of successes , and huge failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to put researchers on these factors to tell you the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First , think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; which is the old moment when you think about it .
Along the way , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to bend or bend , are more important factors than I think .
I never thought it would be appropriate for TED to talk to the researcher at MIT , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan , until I don &apos;t have a plan for me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It &apos;s important to recognize the ability to identify a team from the side of the car .
The car is an Italian fact .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at the business model .
Is an organization doing some obvious illegal work about government ?
With that , it seemed to me that what is the most important thing for success .
Think about new investment .
Sometimes companies get a huge investment .
Could that be the most important ?
After that , of course — is it the right time ?
Did this idea soon happen , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or so many years ago , and so many attacks ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of respect for these five things in many organizations .
And the idea was to go to 100 companies in Libya , and to 100 others out to try and find a scientific result .
So first of all , on these individual laptops , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars &apos; worth of opportunities .
And the bottom five companies — Z.com. , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we had a lot of hope , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to cultivate all the characteristics , as I think these companies had promoted .
And then in leadership companies , I &apos;ve seen strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was great investment in startup companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I &apos;ve tried to figure out , but the most important factors have been affected by the success and failure of all these companies , and the result has surprised me .
The first thing was choice of time .
Forty-four percent of the time is due to success and failure .
The team and the keyboard have a second set of specimens , and then the idea is , to be different , to be different , to be unique , that &apos;s actually number three .
But it &apos;s not really clear , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but it surprised me that the idea isn &apos;t the most important .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
The last two , I think , is business model and investment .
And I think the market model is also kind of cool , because you can start without a commercial model , and then when the product gets bigger in the cave , put it in .
And investment , if initially it was less investment , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples here of all of these nodes .
Take a big success on Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of investors looked at this company because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to get some of your household products on the line ?
Of course , it &apos;s been false .
One of the reasons why gross is successful is because of the best market model , the idea , and the market stock market failure is the right time .
This company came forward in this long way when people needed additional support , and surely helped people to respond to the proposal of putting a banker in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came forward , the best company , the best business model , the best predictor .
However , time was absolutely right , make the creditors part of what they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional support ; it was very important .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we published at TED in 1998 , was when companies wanted more grandmothers than grandmothers .
We thought it was great , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very hungry for it — working with lots of businesses and some of the best businesses , working with the Hall Ward , with great innovators .
In 1999- to 2000 , the broadband Internet was very little .
It was very difficult to see the online video , you had to code in your browser and don &apos;t know what to do , and finally this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of code and dropped 15 percent more in the U.S. , YouTube was at its best .
Great idea , judge your time .
The truth is that YouTube , when it started , was not a business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was choosing the perfect time .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
Ideas matter very much .
But maybe time is too important .
And the best way to refine time is to see if the car is actually ready for your screening .
And the truth of truth is that , if you don &apos;t like the results , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but in terms of the time frame , you have to work very safely .
Like initial organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully , some of those conversations will help improve your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , you &apos;re the best listeners .

&#91; 3 April 2016 we saw the biggest digital hole in history &#93; &#91; Financial Choir designed humans and powerful people &#93; &#91; Incredible money laundering housing companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We launched the Gulf Voters &apos; campaign to illustrate the Pharaoh . &#93; This week , a student stood at the center of the study that brought
Five out of five of them had already written a few secret weather companies .
We have the inner narrative of villages , banks and houses that come in with forms like Morocco Finance , and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see email , you can look at text messages , you can see a way of doing it , how they &apos;re doing it .
Its implications are already starting to emerge .
The director of the E.U. is very famous .
We also have this news that the Swedish doctors are the descendants of Alaska .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of stolen goods go to the original Mir Plan from his childhood friend , who is a famous Sistine .
And many well-meaning people will be infected , and I will be home with more well-known documentaries .
Now this looks like a magical movie , or a violin story , which I have with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that aggressive and powerful people are living in their own backyard , and as much as they don &apos;t need to be taxed , meaning that small actions like teachers have less money on health and education .
And the effect of that is on all of us .
For my organization , Galapagos Venture , this is amazing .
The global media and political leadership are talking about how people have their influence in weekly societies , which we &apos;ve been discovering about .
I think there &apos;s a cool , ugly world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these laptops work .
I think it &apos;s like a roommate .
You can go to another company within a company , another company within a company , which is almost impossible to figure out who is behind it .
It &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s going on for companies to disrupt law , press , school , school .
And I think it &apos;s also interesting in the U.S.
Maybe it &apos;s because the celebrities don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no intelligent people in America who don &apos;t invest in shelter companies .
It &apos;s because of the way the raw companies operate , there are a few U.S. vehicles in Moscow .
I think if we read about the inventions of Kamen Illinand or the Wall Street or the rebellion or the rebellion , the kind of thing that connects the United States .
Instead , many American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give them less information to buy a company than they do with a library card .
In American schools , this kind of information is given to students .
Through that , nine venture capital points are easy to fund .
This kind of breakthrough affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Vincess , we wanted to see how the problem is .
How does it actually work ?
So what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve transported a grant to run 13 households in Manhattan .
Our foundation became an African minister who wanted to move the village across America to buy a home , a ship and a place .
The heartbreaking thing was that all the villages could offer instructions to give a guess how the village could move .
They were all primary meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our money for a criminal , and we didn &apos;t give anybody any money , but it got a bad estimate of the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individual law , which has talked about our suspicious interpretation of cheating and suggestion .
It &apos;s not just a censorship politician that &apos;s been found in Scandille .
This is the way the system works , which tactics and radiation and poverty and insurance .
And in order to do that , we &apos;re going to have to change this game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be hard to create these kinds of ideas .
It can be hypothetical , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people who are rich and powerful are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been taking a step towards transparency where the capability of the company is .
This issue was launched on the political agenda , but the British Prime Minister of Defense issued an eight-story story story in the South Land in 2013 .
And since then , Europe is creating a central record at the local level , whether it &apos;s actually a country in Europe or whether it &apos;s controlling its own .
Turns out , the U.S. is behind that .
The difference in terms of the sophisticated law enforcement is in the central and the network , which we didn &apos;t want to get any improvement , so we did .
They want to look at innovation , larger shell companies , which are used throughout the world and in the U.S.
It &apos;s a moment of change in the Galapagos Venture .
We need to reach out to the people who are familiar behind barbershop companies .
You know , they speak up , and it &apos;s not good for adoption , but we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and they need to address the legitimate change of access to information .
We can aggregate this shortage of secrets that are responsible for restoration and restoration .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that his luxury , which you invented , has had a greater sense of detail in the last few years than any other medium in the world .
Can it be true ?
JC : Yeah , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a bit of a provocation — isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing ineffectiveness that employees are able to perform a small group of information like information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people form documents ?
And how do you balance them ?
Julian Sanguay : Yes , there they are — I can tell you — public services in the right way , and we have lots of ways to get the information to us .
So we use a lot of cool containers to get the materials from one place to another on the Internet , to deliver the signal to law enforcement detectors like Sweden and Belgium .
We get information in the form of a broadcast , whether it &apos;s a broadcast or a magazine or whatever , organizing it like a regular news agency , forming — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive amounts of information for people , and then protecting yourself against the inevitable legal and political compasses .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you never really know what the scale is .
Julian Sanguay : This is true , where we &apos;ve sometimes gotten these lives , and if we get stuck in a situation , we quickly release the information .
( Clapping ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s obvious what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example . It &apos;s real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , that &apos;s the cholera report .
It was a transparent magic report that the government of Kenya prepared for a 2004 election .
Before 2004 , the government was there for 18 years .
She was a senior in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the cube — because of these authoritarian efforts , who were trying to decide what was the power of the report , they bought 20 million pounds of paper towels on the report and one on the report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for its political will , which was the best man — now the best man in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why it was launched in 2007 , and we were able to achieve the success of the elections well before December 2008 .
When we did that report , we did that three days after the new president , Kabul decided to philanthropy the person who was suffering from him , Daniel April , so that he became a reporter in the village of Cairo .
CA : And — I mean , just to mention briefly — it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by the censorship , but by the way , and by your team , it has changed the result of selection .
Julian Sangin : Yes . This is the village of Guardian , and then throughout the entire province of Kenya , in Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he , after a few months , released the Kenyan press relief that they could talk about it .
And this evening ran on the TV 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the vote , according to an online gender report , and it changed the result of a major selection .
CA : Wow , so your secret interpretation has really changed the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re just showing a little bit of a video of a little puzzle .
That &apos;s how long this video is , but here &apos;s a little clip .
This is — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart failure .
RD : ... tough , when you touch them , you touch them with two .
I saw , oh , there are four with them .
The road is clean . It &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your show , tell me . Come on .
All dollars .
Glass , clap !
( Mechanical noises ) Gold running . Gold running . ( Mechanical noises ) Gold running .
Hello . Hi conductor two , two , six .
We have to go , time is up !
Okay , now we &apos;ve got eight people .
Here we see two Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Roger . They &apos;re on my show .
Two , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re on the grass .
Oh , what a contract . What was happening ?
God forbid you , evil . Okay . Yeah , I forgot them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julian Sanguage : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people arrested for him .
It was the first in three cases that happened .
CA : So 11 people were killed in this case , right , two employees in the general director ?
Julian Sangley : Yes ! Two employees in the restaurant , two small children were swallowed .
In total , from 18 to 26 people were killed .
CA : And then there &apos;s plenty of room for him .
What was the main cause of it , what do you think ?
Julian Sanguay : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as the ultimate inequality of power .
On the one hand , there &apos;s some people in the gallery , and then one kilometer away , the Hilly Catter begins to scratch the surface of 30 miles of galleries in each of them — among many — and the winners are also given to the children .
They also had two journalists who were illiterate , because their work was so precise .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining got arrested , and it said he had acknowledged that he had acknowledged this video to you about 280,000 and white American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
JC : So we stopped accepting the documents .
There was a waste of it a day five days ago , and 150,000 documentaries and 50 .
But we &apos;ve done what we did at the beginning of the year in Rwanda and the U.S. subsidiary , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I often came to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got a thousand copyright calls for the U.S. safety house .
Julian Assange : We &apos;re going to do what we do . ( CA : Y &apos;all gonna do it ? ) Julian Assange : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Assange : Because these things are actually showing how , for example , Arab governments are actually violating human rights in these governments .
If you look at the files of this kind of material , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy normally ?
Why is it true that you need to provide free information ?
JC : So the question is , what information is important in the world , what information can lead to .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
That information that organizations spend a lot of money on giving away , that &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out , you have to get something good out of it , because those organizations know it better , and they know their stories , they care about it too .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But are there risks to this as individually or as a collective society , where you take the unexpected risks ?
JC : We didn &apos;t have the documents with them .
I mean , our big challenge is action .
With information , we can sample the information in a very specific way — the information that &apos;s available in that person &apos;s shoes .
But there are also some myths — like your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about these civic goods that come in and out of the way .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing this with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , his daughter , who is a U.S. veteran officer , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had something so profound that some people like to hang other people out .
This shows an American politician whose dead people die .
What this has done is — but it has given millions of people around the world who are American financial awards .
While they &apos;re not , I &apos;m not my daughter , who are you going to say ? What are you going to say ?
JC : Here &apos;s how we get asked a lot of questions like this .
But remember , in the gharial , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people — you don &apos;t need to watch a video , they see it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what their role is , it doesn &apos;t matter what their perception is .
Because they see it every day .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and their minds that fund them all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you &apos;re looking forward to what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to see this light switch on , that you should be keeping yourself secure as your own ?
JC : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not different .
We don &apos;t have the same intellectual property that comes from other minds .
If they do that , that &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically motivated to feel that they &apos;re going to increase the jobs later on .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , what we &apos;ve done is — let &apos;s talk about it here from the innocent .
You can also imagine that there will be different kinds of breakthroughs about Lake Lake and Julie .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or the problem .
What does the hero look like ?
And what are the problems ?
JC : Oh ! Something should happen .
CA : These are great people , young people .
We &apos;re going to have to try and — they &apos;re going to show another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think for TED you &apos;ve done it .
Here &apos;s a very interesting story , which is a little old , right ?
What is that ?
JC : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year — in November there were a lot of important pipelines installed in the banana , as in the solar chemistry , but not so big .
And we got the Report Mile — which was a great experiment about it — which was to say that actually , conservation agencies were contracting different sources of oil , they went out and they went .
And there was something about the banana government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing on that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We didn &apos;t know who he was writing and what it was about .
So we were surprised that maybe this was a company that did all these things in the competition .
We put it on the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This stuff is okay , and it seems like it &apos;s okay to see , but we can &apos;t imagine it . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that he wrote , and he wanted to wear a letter . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we want to write a letter about it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What documents are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by it ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they took this feedback that we had on Scripture with the name of the factory , with the Microsoft World Wide Web .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of understanding and predicting what the material is , and trying to write and get the letters from these people .
CA : All right . So is there any information available in the Bible ?
JC : Yeah , we have a lot of things , I mean , at the time , we &apos;re going to collect and refine things like hard steps .
And so our response to publishing has become somewhat different in the past few months , because we &apos;ve been improving our banking system because of the rare public waste that we have .
This is water .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing , more than our capabilities are involved in us because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in the population , very smart , but we don &apos;t have people who can modify and anticipate all this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , basically , why did you want to be a journalist or a journalist ?
JC : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very hard to fix because the kinds of materials that we &apos;re dealing with , so we have to rebuild the organization so that we can get people to work with a lot of sensitivity on the materials of the local preservation , and then a little bit of sensitivity .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about your own work and how you &apos;re going to get there .
And I think what I &apos;ve learned is that you went to 37 different schools in a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sangley : Yes , my parents were in the movies business , and then they were moving away from the city , so the two reasons were affected .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so what you &apos;re saying is that everything can be done can be just intellectual property .
JC : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a teenager , and you were kind of getting into the workshop pretty quickly .
JC : Yes , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a recruitment worker from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I was the girl at the time when I got stuck in the crime .
So you have to have a word with respect .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that different things can be used .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only using Russian macaroni that your grandmother can actually make a bank account .
That &apos;s why the word doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think that &apos;s your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps something about their life that helped them do ?
JC : I don &apos;t believe in the truth .
But the basic value : good , tough people are not producing the victims ; they &apos;re growing them .
And this is the skin that I learned from my father and some other brilliant and heavy people who live in my life .
CA : Brilliant and heavy people are not producing insults ?
Julian Sanguay : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a junior man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of improving the police , which is close to collapse .
And this is what exists in my office for a long time .
CA : So just to give us a quick overview of what happened in the last few years ?
Basically , you &apos;ve published something out there , you &apos;ve got a bank account , and then you &apos;ve published the story with the privilege of keeping it out .
Instead , they showed up your situation .
So you &apos;ve become pretty famous in the U.S.
JC : Yeah , it &apos;s a great fact . You know .
The E.U. is a crisis .
There she was .
The bank there was growing at 10 percent the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that in July last year .
And the state of Tehran , five minutes before he was signed , as a movie : &quot; The state of the art of disaster relief on the News , and the state of the News Rader , &quot; This has never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming , and we became very popular in Iceland , I went to the L.A. and talked about this issue .
And those people there were parts that shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the Shi Landers , the Shi Landers , some of the other international innovators , we proposed a kind of ASL Land law , which is kind of like free media , why the journalists around the world are the most safe place , the new Nepal print , with a free light bulb .
A country like Ice Land is like this one , which is heading up from the bottom of the system .
And just a month ago , the Paralympics of the East Land looked at it perfectly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look at the future , do you realize that there &apos;s more likely to be expressions of power and power , greater generosity , or are we going to see equal power , or are they going to do so ?
Julian Sanguay : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going to come from .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure for the law of liberal demand , and in the law of transparency , around the world — between Europe , China and the U.S.
What cross is it going to take ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can fall aside from one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating listeners &apos; emails into these words , geeks , embracing them , and all the power is for you .
JC : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and seeing both .
So I did this , which is the shepherd &apos;s staff .
I used to run around the corner of my children &apos;s kitchen cabinet , and I would look at these cabinets .
When I got older and got back home in the early 1990s , I got this call .
My team was a coach .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view of a mirror , I kind of figured out , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the mini-mart , wherever I &apos;d gone , surely North Carolina , Persia , or Indonesia , there were four species on the ice that were being swallowed by four species — yellow , silence and code .
And I wondered if this was a big deal , and I wondered if anybody could ever have a baby booth .
And when I took a leave of it , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching the Catholic team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
There is no unusual human quality to constrain the natural world to a few elements .
We did this 10 thousand years ago when we removed our caves .
If you look at the light bulb 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see radioactive and robust organisms like that .
But if you look back to the year 2000 , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , cattle and roll .
It &apos;s also true of strangers .
If you look at New York City &apos;s paths 150 years ago , or 200 years ago , you will see images , images , images and text .
But if you look at the existing distance , you &apos;re only going to get four orders of raw materials , trains , squares , but also squares .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Shah .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been acting like this .
The Second World War gave us tremendous excitement to be cool .
During the great war , we developed technologies such as smoking , bullying and so forth , all of these things collapsed .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see a tremendous increase in the capacity for recovery .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that famine and marine agriculture have been increasing , and within a couple of years , its result has been growing exponentially .
Now if you collect forest cattle and forest cattle , it will be equivalent to two Chinese twins every year from the sea .
My Chinese counterparts don &apos;t agree with me , because China is not just one of the largest retailers , but the largest retailers .
Let &apos;s now turn to four choices .
The first is the U.S. and the most utilized salt food in the West .
Language is an incredibly bad source .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest to get to market .
Language is an incredibly precise form of entertainment to the market .
In a study done by the Dutch University , it showed that methane from gas is extremely inefficient to detect CO2 from methane .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where battlefields are lying in the forest region are the Mongolia wars .
Now look at these beautiful girls .
They &apos;re detecting the soil from their place , protecting the beaches , sleeping and leaving babies for the environment .
Something like this happened with a lot of recent funeral fights .
Over the last 30 or 40 years , we &apos;ve been eating millions of coastal plants .
Another procedure that &apos;s here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the tropics right now , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now , there &apos;s been some recent years that leopard seals from the nest , but with it , with a very large number of other leopard seals , they can catch other leopard seals and turn them into food in the late .
And a lot of times , they get a job with the slaves that are named after the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means changing it in fresh food , which means the ecosystem is opening up and making it cool .
And then there &apos;s the second big food crop in the U.S. and the West .
The tuna is like a global mission .
The tuna has to send sight to a very large area in order to organize .
Our region , which is called the Actual Financial Management Archive , or the ICCAT , is the Internet Conservation of Electronic Train .
Carl Swiss has also been the great inventor of all technology .
We can build platforms for tuna , but it &apos;s not good for tuna fireflies .
Not many people know , but tattoos are heated .
It can travel more than 40 miles an hour , and it can absorb 20 gigatons of warmth for its environment .
All the benefits of this lottery are almost done .
Flood vessels are the blood vessels that don &apos;t slow down .
It &apos;s great for protein .
But the forest creatures are 40 miles away from the county that they cannot stay in the ground .
Sometimes it &apos;s too late , it &apos;s not necessarily too late .
This is my political connectome .
Connect was running out of space .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every data is a document .
There are over 3,000 candidates in the policy of connect .
I say connectome is mostly people . ( Laughter ) If anyone has opened the connectome , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere there are these mountains , these are the towers that are pushing harder to give to children .
As a result , we have a successful leap forward and a successful leap forward for performance .
When the space shuttle began , the space shuttle used six pounds to build a foundation .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
In contrast , it &apos;s also a small false watch , because if you look at the Freedom of Information Act , they don &apos;t drop the peanut button on a page .
Whereas this database is driven by a dry seat .
Something that &apos;s hard to say when you &apos;re talking about leather dollars and shelter .
But then again , the credit card industry required that it replaced the banana sludge on alternative space .
It &apos;s a system that &apos;s produced by acousticians that are playing with the Earth .
This goes back seven percent per year .
Even though we spend less money on getting a job to the marketplace , we &apos;re also making lots of little jobs .
We don &apos;t just drink milk , but we also drink milk and tears .
We have the same kind of shrimp that &apos;s eating grass , and the same shrimp that &apos;s eating grass .
Because on the left , the blood and the hands are picking up and giving bed nets .
Would I be surprised to know that he had opened the stone ?
India is the first or the first . ( Laughter ) And this is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of forest cattle that &apos;s been taken out of the ocean .
That &apos;s the third chapter in China , or the number of people in America who get out of the sea every year .
That &apos;s the last thing in four .
The Philippines actually began as lions .
And it started with the owner of a local manufacturer who saw that the next day he would never be on a McDonald &apos;s .
He went to the left and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
It was a clue to the oceans that Hallelujah was worth more than Christmas .
So he created his lifetime scenario .
Unfortunately , the censorship came down at 30 cents .
He wanted to build a 25-cent camera , so he pulled the Atlantic Code .
The manufacturing license plate of Philadelphia is the largest mass-industrial arts industry in the United States , where between 23 billion and 3 billion pounds a year go out of the sea .
If we end Poland , the current option may be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plasma protein in a very efficient way in the animal protein , and it &apos;s worldwide for me .
In fact , this is a very solvable solution that &apos;s coming out of an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a shapeshifter .
There are no EMs and DVDs associated with that that we think will live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , it &apos;s about poor little leopard .
That &apos;s about three million tons in size .
One possibility that conservation environments have determined is , can we eat it ?
Can we choose not to give them peace instead of giving them peace ?
There are problems for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , where the average elite is the opposite of prison and the effect is at the top of the Indus Valley .
This is the third largest contribution to EPA and DNA .
So this is his ability .
But do we take this path and instead of just pay a few dollars , pay a few pounds , pay a few pounds , and then flip it over to a Facebook page , and we can pay the rent , and we can pay the rent , and we can pay the rent , and we can pay the rent , and we can pay the rent , and we can pay the rent ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that the house is special .
They have a lot of EPAA and DIY as well .
The Indus calculus is quite effective .
Indonesia &apos;s revenues are only three parts .
Actually , the average of three doesn &apos;t come from the kitchen .
The ocean is three stories tall , so they &apos;re just collected .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue greengrass , we have been trained to use fracture and neutralization .
Over 400 new deaths in the last decades have been producing death , which is a huge killer of the oceans .
As you might think about the Cloud , there are more than three protons and , on average , these are very effective signals .
This is exactly what happens .
And the next one is a question mark .
We can create a pattern that can help us create transparent proteins .
These creatures should be green plants , they should grow fast and change their environment , and they should be EPA and DHA OMC and Facebook .
This is already in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But they &apos;re trying to do something about it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the ocean .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s going to get a little bit more generous .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was born to read the big brain because I have a brother who suffers from a stroke .
More and more , I wanted to think as a scientist , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams come true ?
What happens with my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia is that they don &apos;t connect their dreams to the public and to the common reality and they act on it .
So I decided to dedicate my life to research severe mental illness .
And I moved to Boston with my parents &apos; project at the San Francisco Bay Area where I worked at the Ministry of Defense for chemistry at Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in the brain of people who are looking for answers on a biological level , versus the brain of people who are normally referred to as non-zero-sumness , versus the brain of people who are in schizophrenia or schizophrenia or vice charges ? So what we &apos;re actually trying to do is we &apos;re trying to engineer neurosurgeons in the brain , whose cells are
So there was a lot of privilege in my life because I was doing this kind of research day , but on September and July four weeks , I was traveling through a law called NAMI to take my trip .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I was asked to find out that I was faced with an intelligent CD .
The lower part of my brain was a new fire .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and remember things in the morning of February .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a similar brain , there are two parts of it that are very different from each other .
I &apos;m going to show you a human brain .
( Laughter ) So this is actually a human brain .
This is the part of the brain that &apos;s sitting behind the back of the brain , and it &apos;s going to sit in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two pieces of it , completely separate from each other .
Those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , where the left part of our brain functions like a solar system .
These two parts are transferring messages to each other across the entire globe , connecting with 300 volunteers .
But there are two sides to it .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part has to understand information in a very different way , and their aspirations are different things , and let me just let you let them know that their personalities are very different from each other .
It &apos;s going to be okay . Thank you . It &apos;s been a lot of fun .
Interviewer : Yes , it &apos;s pretty cool .
( Laughter ) The evidence for our brains is only partially thought about this moment .
So right now , we &apos;re thinking about images of our brains in a way that &apos;s organically thought about the way our bodies move .
Information flows through the body and expands throughout the body , throughout the nervous system , and then it drops to a giant aluminum class that tells us what exists in the present moment and how in the mind , how to feel and how to read .
I &apos;m an energy bound by the energy that surrounds the right brain through consciousness .
We are the sources of energy that are leaking from one another to the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers from this planet who are dedicated to making the world better .
And in that moment , we are completely beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The lower left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that our current largest aluminum / cloud is beginning to collect details from it and then assemble those metrics .
And it also informs all of the information that &apos;s going on in the past , all of the things that we &apos;ve learned , and the possibilities of the future , namely , for our projects .
The left part of our brain is thinking in language .
It &apos;s a conversation that &apos;s driving us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that you should go home and buy and remind me of it .
I need them in the morning , it &apos;s the consciousness of me making a book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the one that says , I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become disconnected .
I become one of the only people around me with incredible energy and excitement .
And that part of my brain happened earlier this morning in the aftermath of Florida .
On the morning of the calving face , my left eye is glowing with pain .
It was this kind of heartbreaking , this kind of heartbreaking experience .
And that pain just dragged me around and left .
And then he stopped and he left .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never suffered from any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to chores and I put on my cardboard clip , which is a mass training machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , so it feels like my hand is the first human being to ever wave the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is such a strange thing , &quot; &quot; and then I look back at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel such a strange , poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being that &apos;s going through this experience , but I &apos;m now in a poor and mysterious place where my consciousness has been
And it was all very strange and poor , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started screaming in the room , and I felt like everything inside my body was simple .
And it &apos;s all very difficult and very thoughtful .
I don &apos;t have a road map at my speed , and I think there &apos;s a road map that focuses only on the internal system .
I &apos;m standing in my tin can cooking underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice saying , my daughter has to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing , and I &apos;m standing on the wall .
I &apos;m sitting there looking at my hands , and I realize that I can &apos;t recover the damage of my body .
I didn &apos;t understand where I started and where I ended , because my hand and my hand were held together by Adam and Malaysia .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my left brain , the conversation just kept quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice with a remote control .
A third party .
First , I was surprised by the wiring of my brain .
But then it was as quickly as possible for the energy in another laptop in this huge space flight that was around me .
And since I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt part of the energy that was so beautiful .
And then a woman rushed to the left side of my brain , and she said to me , &quot; You are a Muslim . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I &apos;ve come back to the same consciousness that I &apos;m calling for a lot of money .
But they were beautiful places .
Think about how beautiful it is that you &apos;re completely tied to this tiny brain that is wrapped around the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this vessel where my work and my work are getting pushed .
I felt so much in my body .
And compare all of your relationships that come from the outside world and from them , stress was missing .
And I felt a sense of peace .
And consider what it would look like if you went back to the last 37 years with the emotional equilibrium that you were holding .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a mess .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain went to the left side of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking , should I help me get my sleeve on this , so I &apos;m pouring necklace from the back of the house and I &apos;m walking into my apartment now and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive a car ? &quot; &quot; And that moment my mothers hand in complete paralysis .
At that time , it occurred to me that my God was attacking me at the university , the one thing my mind was telling me , and how awesome it is !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
Some of the brain researchers will have the opportunity to realize that they can consciously contract their own brain and go inside — ( Laughter ) — and then one minute come to my brain , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m so busy . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into the field . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
He said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t get firefighting , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job , and then I remembered that I had a business card on my phone .
So I go to my studio room and I open up a three-story motorcycle card .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , while I can see it clearly in my mind &apos;s eye , and I can &apos;t tell you what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , because I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to look like a bunch of dots .
And the dot of the word would be helped by the marks of the paper and the markers , and I didn &apos;t learn anything .
And then I started waiting for him to describe it to me .
And at that moment , the normal truth was repeated , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this video .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the impact of the fuel was on the left .
I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took a Band-Aid card and I put it there , and now I &apos;m looking at the card and I &apos;m looking at the phone as it rolls over the cable .
But then I run up to my lady &apos;s side when I was coming back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I had that sample .
So I raised my hand like a Danish , and I raised my hand on the Indians , and I raised my hand on the other hand , and I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , when I came back to the general truth , I could tell you that I was here first , but finally , with all the Indians , and I heard that the phone rang out from my wrist , a guy answer@@
And then I say to her , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking about men who need help . &quot;
And the voice that sounds like &quot; &quot; Wow &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he came to me with what I didn &apos;t know that I could speak and understand any language until I tried to .
So he understood that I needed help and he robbed me .
And then a little while later , there was a chapter in an ambulance , and a chapter was running through the hospital from one of the other mosques at Boston .
I could get up and look like the children of the foot .
Just like a candle waiting for the rest of the room and just out of nowhere , I pulled the energy out , and I felt a sense of urgency .
And it occurred to me that I was no longer authorized in my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me the opportunity to have a second life or a moment of transition .
The second time I went , I was surprised that I was alive .
When I felt helpless to my soul , I gave life to God .
Now my brain was stroking apart between two facts .
At that time , the motion of my emotional system was starting to begin to feel just lost in pain .
Light rushed my brain like a fire in the forest , and the lights were too close and dim to the background , so I didn &apos;t hear a sound , or I didn &apos;t hear a sound , and I was just scribbling the curtain .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture , so I felt enormous and wide like someone who had been liberated from my boss .
And my spirit was unleashed like a great hole in the ocean of wild fire .
Great . Neuron .
He gave me the qualities that he gave me .
And I was reminded of the thought that it would never be possible that I would discover my wonderful existence and learn within the small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive and depressed .
And if I &apos;m born with neurons and I &apos;m alive now , whatever life it is that neurons can reach , and I &apos;ve seen a world that is rich with people who are beautiful , transparent , comfortable and loving , who know that they can sometimes feel that quality .
And they can pick up John and choose the right to see if he wants to take his book to the left side of his brain to search for transparency .
And then he understood how amazing this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was the lesson of the poetry that taught me how to live my life .
And he encouraged me to be healthy .
After the collision course of the calving face , the gold miner gave me a glimpse of blood from my brain that was investigating the central potential of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real breakthrough in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of quantum life with a handful of skills and two extremely accurate brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world where we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can stand on the right side of my consciousness at the same time .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful cellulose is made from cartilage cells , one that &apos;s all there .
Or I can choose to step back to the left part of my consciousness where I become an individual .
Ways of chemical fertilization .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
I have the inside us .
Who would you choose ?
Who would you choose ?
And when ?
I think as long as we spend our left-right brain reserving the electrical impulse , we &apos;re going to increase world peace and our planet is going to become so transparent .
And I thought it was necessary to solve this idea .
Thank you .

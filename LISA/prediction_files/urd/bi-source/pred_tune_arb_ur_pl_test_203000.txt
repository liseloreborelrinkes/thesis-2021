Good morning !
You guys are gone ?
They took my name to the Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , a young age , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating .
So I asked the question , do you have the Arab Spring ?
He looked at me strangely , and he thought he must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Shhhhhhhhhh ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minnesota . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , deal , deal with this problem ! &quot; &quot; And he said .
She was speaking to me with three people , as she said to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I will not see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; Miner &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can they talk like this ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got angry about it .
Sure enough .
What is it that makes me feel good to speak my own country ?
Where does that happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am like many people , who reach the end of their lifetime , where they inherently leave everything that is in their mind , just because they love to say , and they find compassion .
Should I be bringing all of my culture , all of my ideas , my spirit and my spirit ?
We may have the most important battle reserves in the history of children .
Should they give me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What &apos;s the point ?
And yet , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for him , as he did for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research , or the language that we use in neuroscience , or the language that we use in the workplace , the language that we use when we label a research project , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the iPod .
If we do that , they will close our doors .
So where can I exploit it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is a mother tongue .
Research tells us that in other languages , we need to translate that into our mother tongue .
In other languages , the teacher of the mother tongue is the primary language .
How ?
The bronze cell , when he first started writing , used Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imagination and philosophy were influenced by the little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a particular joy , a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Until they wrote in English , when you read their texts in English , you feel the same sense of happiness , you feel the same sense .
Now , you can imagine that this is also in English , this little boy who was walking around in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
The second is , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill a nation , it &apos;s by killing its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are emerging .
Germany , France , Japan and China are in all directions .
That &apos;s why they create laws for protecting their tongue .
They make it valuable .
That &apos;s why they use it in cash , spend a lot of money on dissemination and Venice .
Do we know better ?
Well , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset is not even reaching us yet , and we want to move to the developing world .
They were countries that were like us at a time , but they decided to try to grow , study , and move to countries , such as Taiwan , employees , and so on , they were taking their own language , as they were taking their children , as they were taking care of them .
They brought it close to home .
Because if you take Turkey and you make Turkey and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be involved in these caves , unbeknownst to predators , as we do most of the time .
So to create new innovations and new jobs , they needed to preserve their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; security , autonomy , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would he understand ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how , how .
Languages are not just for conversation ; words are just for us .
Language is a sign of a particular set of steps in our lives , and words that are separated from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Period , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special circuit in your brain , and there are special emotions for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of bringing one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that we think about , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our mind ?
How would you understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereign , independent , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes over and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t look at a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about slavery .
The point is that these affections remind us of a particular thing .
I &apos;m a French speaker friend who &apos;s a French speaker .
Once upon a time , she was asked .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his husband and translate him one night , and tried to translate what he meant to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A hundred women got it wrong , and then they tried to figure it out .
He was thinking , how could it be that obvious ?
Do they want to self-assemble ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his husband , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; he &apos;s different from the way he thinks about it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he , he listens to me for February , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I felt when I heard February . &quot; &quot; A young woman tried to translate her , &quot; &quot; Then I raised her hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you &apos;re me , I put my hand on and I let you
It translates . It shows me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started the vocabulary of Arabic language .
Although many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Whether the hell &apos;s gone , get out of the way . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language language forced a message , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because , in this way , we didn &apos;t understand it .
And if anyone says to me , I hate English .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be creative in the way that our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
So the book is the same as ours and the same as ours .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the right sign .
Very simple , but very efficient .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside , a landscape in which the letter and the yellow box is in the back of the box , with the text , &quot; kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We really shouldn &apos;t have to kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to find a existence for ourselves .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very easy to create sentences , novelty and religion .
After that , we found boys and girls in Arabic .
Cole images of boys and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve got the word &quot; &quot; Coca-Cola &quot; &quot; in there . &quot; &quot; They want to admit how much advice they want to do , but I &apos;ve got to give them a word that &apos;s good and equal to the fact .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m living in a large part of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not , we shouldn &apos;t be saving ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to let anybody grow up or understand that our language has authority at the top , putting pressure on us , or putting pressure on our own patients and thinking on our own .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the blood or not refine the skeleton or anything , we can still be creative .
At that time , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in your mother tongue .
Let &apos;s start with that .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global level .
He can re-branch the Arabic script first .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we &apos;re going to have to know that , and we have to think that the solution is there , that we have to be part of the solution .
Last year , what can you do today ?
Who are you tweeting ?
To Muslims , I &apos;m going to leave you with , though , my time is gone , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin dictionaries !
( Applause ) It &apos;s remarkable ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a mathematical language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back and get long .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the desire to protect this language .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , is in a language of her father .
When my daughter was born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , huh . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I recited my daughter from the light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you Mama .
And don &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this cultural press . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to say that it reminds us that our presence isn &apos;t a option , and I have been haunted by the negative affairs that have made me stop when you look at my generation , and I &apos;ve been terrified of this generation of inequality that doesn &apos;t make us feel good about our generation until they &apos;re known to give us our traditions , how much we use and how much we expect them
( Applause )
I love chocolate cake .
In college , my primary thesis was vegetables , which meant I had to write a lot of magazines .
Now a normal person , when they write something , will do something like this .
You know , you know â€” ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to start your work a little bit slower , but the first week they do a lot of work and a lot of work later , everything &apos;s done , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My responsibility is all going to be ready , but actually the text function will go on , and then I &apos;ll do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all the textbooks .
And then came back to these new pages of research , the text work you do in one year .
And I knew that my common approach was not challenging .
It was a huge job .
I set up a plan , and I decided to do something like this .
Something will happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , mid-month jobs are going to increase , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
He came and went , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we redesigned a great project .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then the treatment room would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two weeks went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went one day , and I spent three days in DL , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I spent 90 pages , two streets , two streets , and I didn &apos;t have to go on two streets â€” I spent time in Cambodia , and I spent time in DDylan and eventually everything .
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tommy ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the dad . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to see it today , that &apos;s the best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be compassionate for that moment , when you were all thinking , &quot; This is outrageous . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the system .
My Ranger regularly calls me blank , and I wanted to tell the sixth people what &apos;s happening in the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain makes a difference between the six people .
Knowing that I had a lymph nodding where I could have both of these brains simultaneously clear and left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not very graphic , but look at it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the difference .
Both of them have decisions in their brains for decades , but the brain of the Sistine is in the human brain , and it &apos;s entertaining .
Now , what does this mean for a sister ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; Work is the best time . &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart man will decide to make meaningful decisions , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he won &apos;t listen to the cover , and he says , &quot; &quot; Put on the page of Charles &apos; page . &quot; &quot; Tennessee and Mount Hadfield , because I know it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) Then â€” ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go to the floor , and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After that , they &apos;re going to look at YouTube , and they &apos;re going to start talking about the meaning of Richard &apos;s foundation , and very soon they &apos;re going to end up watching the videos on Twitter .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while for all of these things , so it &apos;s not going to take time to do something today .
What &apos;s going to happen ? ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now it &apos;s not the foundation of compassion that you want to call .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It seems to me that the future has nothing to do with thinking only two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s fine .
If you know and you spend your entire life going forward and forward , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to create , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Good nutrition , good nutrition , and increasing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happens in the long run .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not that far off .
We are an increasingly educated species , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a well-meaning person , who makes us capable of doing something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re moving away .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is to figure out how to do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes it seems as if they do what is easily and enjoyable , like eating , thinking , or enjoying the opportunity .
There &apos;s a picture for that .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do it , which is difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the pinnacle .
And for those of you in the audience , this agreement always finishes the end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet path , a simple and permanent path that tends to think outside the circle .
I call it a tricky place .
( Laughter ) The Dark Ages are a place where the Sistine people are very good at .
That &apos;s where services are at the moment when they don &apos;t have to be a leader .
In the Dark Ages , which further enhances you , it &apos;s not really because it &apos;s not just the right thing to do , the space feeling , the fear , the anxiety , and the feeling of hatred â€” it &apos;s all the properties in the right place .
The question is , in this way , when the building blocks , how does the system get itself into the blue , which is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that the Sistine people also have protection , which always protect them in their logical moments â€” somebody mentioned it at home .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s a household that &apos;s more common , but when David Lynn gets close , it gets really great , or it &apos;s when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that it only works by that .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because a few months ago , TED people called me and gave me a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
I had a dream party at TED last month .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But among my pockets , there was something in the brain that was making decisions .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going on in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian map at the bottom of the 20,000-foot map , we &apos;ll just leave it there until we see India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , another month later , the TED people decided to know the names of the Khmer Rouge .
I opened the web , and there was a picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The toilet that was captured , and within seconds the system was determined to be on the track . ( Laughter )
And he remembers being â€” he &apos;s afraid of the household that he &apos;s afraid of â€” he rolls down the tree .
And finally , and finally , a well-meaning decision maker sent the board off and I could start talking .
Now , the homemade player who talks about all forms of puzzle , someone like me who gives you two weeks of training and can &apos;t even begin the class , and then gives you an incredibly successful assignment to go out and write a sentence .
And the three keys of cleanliness is what we call the system of six-year-olds .
It &apos;s very good . It &apos;s not good for anybody .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about this .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the influence of it .
In fact , I &apos;ve got thousands of emails from around the world and from people who have different kinds of emotions .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , penetrators and bus stops .
( Laughter ) And nearly one thing he said , and he wrote , &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this dilemma . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the question of email and email address .
In the textbooks of these people , they were listening to the textbooks of how much Solly wrote about his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
Well , it turns out that there are two parts per million .
Today I gave you examples , which were all about subjects , all about data .
And when David Layne is born , recent impact has been killing him because of the housing that he gets .
But the Soviet Union is a different kind of thing , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any David Laden .
So if you want a project like this that you start yourself , like some art or business â€” like some art or business , until you start driving yourself and you end up following yourself , doing things .
In addition to tasks , there are so many things that David Lawn doesn &apos;t have , like getting in with his family , doing exercise , thinking about his health , thinking about their relationships , telling them to behave in ways that they don &apos;t have .
Now , if the only way you can do a job is to go home and work in Sierra Leone , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data sets that are created in the context of the household that &apos;s lost .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest impact is that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re constantly with your dad .
And it &apos;s a kind of typical metaphor that &apos;s much less glamorous and much less talked about than modernity , a kind of profound metaphor .
You are correcting from bad news .
And that could be the case for traditional death rates and return .
So I thought it was because of their email , and they &apos;re in the streets .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban bandied on them , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and it showed one thing : I don &apos;t think there are any six people .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us â€” ( Applause ) â€” and perhaps some of you in the U.K. have good relationships with Dylan , but remembering keys when Dylan doesn &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
They &apos;re not so many blocks , especially when some of them are socialized .
I think we all need to be brilliant about this currency .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because in every single life , no one is getting sick .
We need to embrace compassion .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have a home there , maybe we should start right now .
Not from now on , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
On the eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan , a handful of eight days , a handful of Afghanistan was moving from one area of Afghanistan to lobby for a government office to help protect the Afghan government , to provide a government service provider to provide security services to the Afghan government to provide a government service provider to provide security services , to provide services to the Afghan government
He came in at the end of the aftermath of an attack , and he lived around three , and with so many things , he watched Captain Seventine as a child by the time Captain Seventine was born , and he watched as a child by the time the victims would come and save the dead .
One of the people who knew her children and she grew up with a Spanish shepherd boy , and she grew up with a Hirley shepherd boy .
In fact , it &apos;s shown that Kepton Seventine and Moonies refer to this mysterious flaw that circulates in circulation .
They put it in helium cockpit , and then you see the Captain Seventine sitting there and they buried it before they allowed others to save .
I looked at it , and I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is it ? It &apos;s an extremely depressing emotion when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love , and I knew why I work with people that they don &apos;t .
You know , at the end of the day , people who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In the businesses , we give those people the will to vote for others so that we can benefit .
We have an Italian calculus !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
And that &apos;s why they go to the forest .
These better people embrace this imagination of services .
But it &apos;s totally wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a habitat , and if you have a dedicated environment , we have the capacity to work together , so each one of us has the capacity to compete and work together , and increase the capacity to do that for others .
I have some of the greatest privilege of meeting these people â€” we &apos;re going to call them Yesterday â€” and we &apos;re going to call them Yesterday â€” and we &apos;re going to give our knowledge to save other people , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing : &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that these emotions are not just emotions .
It &apos;s not possible for you to &quot; &quot; chase me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It can &apos;t be that I put two people together and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does it come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago , at the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is under threat , all those layers are hardwired to us .
Nothing natural .
Desire can be less resourceful ; it &apos;s a long-term stewardship ; it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan .
And so we were ready in the form of social animals where we are together and we are working together to do what I call a charity , like in a neighborhood where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we were compassionate and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can sleep at night and I can sleep at night and see some dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern age is exactly the same .
It &apos;s the world &apos;s risk factors that are trying to make our lives difficult or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
These societies can scale up in a way that the stock market couldn &apos;t possibly be .
This could be a new technology that you can download your commercial breakfast one night , and it could be a new technology that will lead your commercial breakfast at night .
Or you can have a confrontation that sometimes tries to kill you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but at least it drives you up and it tries to drive your businesses to drive you down , and it tries to steal your arms and your businesses to drive you down .
We have no authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it never ends .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is , because that &apos;s the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization , the preservation of the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization , and the result of that is that they judge their own personal and good-looking results , and that they judge their own personal and good-looking results to make people feel secure and feel sec@@
I was on a vacuum trip , and I recognized the fact that when a traveler tried to walk in front of him before he was rescued , and I saw the staff at the door that they had come from this person , just as he had pushed the law as he was .
One time I tried to fight it , it was the first time I tried to fight it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are we doing things like electricity ?
Why can &apos;t you work with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Virgin Islands is not because they are saving the Muslim peoples better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their CEOs .
You &apos;ll notice that if conditions open up , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and therefore less organization .
What a great leader is going to give you the nearest example of how to be a parent is going to lead the nearest example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , policy and record , when it &apos;s necessary , we want to give our children the opportunities , the education , the institution , when it &apos;s necessary , to give them the opportunity to grow and to make more of what we can do for themselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , policy and record , and when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunities , the education , the systems , the record , when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to create self-confidence , they want to have access and failure so that they can achieve more advances than we &apos;ve ever imagined .
Charlie Kamen , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York , says , if you &apos;ve got a hard time in your family , will you ever let your kid go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organizations ? How can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charles lost his job as a professional activist , and Charles lost his job as an activist .
If you &apos;re in Next Jump , you &apos;re not going to get the job done .
But if you have a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , just like we do for our kids who come home from school .
It &apos;s very different .
That &apos;s the reason that these people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at CEOs , and the reason that these people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at CEOs , and the reason that these people are so angry and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at CEOs , whose pursuits are more stressed and more courageous .
It &apos;s not about data .
But they have violated the fundamental principles of customization .
They have grown a dense society .
We know that they have given their well-being to their children , and we know that they have given their well-being to their children , but that they have given their well-being to their children , and that they have given their well-being to their people , and that they have given their well-being to their children .
That &apos;s what we assume is not data .
Is there any reason why the planet should have invested 150 million dollars in gold ?
Why didn &apos;t teachers make 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Not at all .
A good leader will never provide a victim of people to save data .
A good leader will never provide a victim of people to save data .
They &apos;re going to give people skin data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people skin data to save .
Baby Chip Chekhov is running a mini-finance company in the Buddhist monastery called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who was commissioned by the greatest trader , and he held 30 percent of the traffic overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their properties more .
They needed 10 million dollars to be saved , so many of the companies that are now involved in keeping the boards and doing the right thing .
And Bob answered that .
You &apos;ll notice that the Bush administration doesn &apos;t trust the Bush administration .
It &apos;s also believing in cotton fields , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce constraints , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce constraints .
And then they built a dedicated program .
That every job , every service , every service , every service , every CEO , would have to go to CEO for four weeks without electricity .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But as Buddha declared the program , he stays very important .
He said it was better that we all took small dosages instead of making some of us much more likely to accept and feel that way .
They have saved 20 million dollars , and the most important thing is , as people expect , when they feel protected from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just as nobody expected , people started trading off each other .
They were more successful with less successful people .
That is , some acquired five volunteers so that one person alone needs three volunteers .
Gravity is an extreme , not a contradiction .
I know many people who benefit from the most successful institutions , I know many people who are benefiting from the most successful institutions which are not a leader at all .
They are athletes , and we do what they say , because they have authorities on us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of an organization who have no authority , and they are real leaders , and that is because they have chosen to see the person on the left , and that is because they have chosen to see the person on the left , and they have helped to see the person on the right .
This is a letter .
I heard a story about some of the things that were happening outside of the theater , and as the technique of philosophy is that the person eats honey and they preach to their people , and when they eat , they have nothing to do with it .
And when he returned to the field , his men gave him some of his food to eat because he did .
We tell them they do it .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous first , we call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that their people can be safe , and that &apos;s how they benefit , and when we do that , natural responsibility is how our people can afford us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their lungs , and they &apos;ll give us a glimpse of their dreams becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your lungs and you give it to the person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say , &quot; &quot; Because they do it for us too . &quot; &quot; And aren &apos;t those organizations that we would like to do all of this ?
And aren &apos;t those organizations that we would all like to do ? &quot; &quot; And aren &apos;t those organizations that we would all like to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in a small story about the Limpopo , which is right at the edge of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where water and algae are highly unreliable , such as the mosquito , and it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions , at 17 years old , I was staying quiet with my friends in the bathroom .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was walking around the corner , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent something that just showers you and doesn &apos;t cover you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people have no access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and there are only a few in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is the most dangerous chromosome we call .
There &apos;s a revolution in the eyes of the trunk because of the lens of the eye , and if you &apos;re one of the more fragile states of the trunk , you can instantly fall off .
This disease affects eight million people every year , and the most important thing is to keep yourself from the trachoma : no odds , no vegetables , no engineering .
After seeing the data from Afghanistan , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I took my brilliant novel out of 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , didn &apos;t have a web broadcast on the Internet at 20 o &apos;clock
And I saw this as a particularly problematic problem .
So Mahammad said yes , we were ready .
Now we need to do that in the coordination .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on the phone , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country , and â€” ( &quot; &quot; no more missing ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DriBath , the world &apos;s first myth .
You just wear it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to wear it .
( Laughter ) So after attempting to make it work in high school , and finite resources , which I had , the U.N. invaded some new people , did more of this work , and now we have a full-scale model that &apos;s ready to buy the market now .
We learned some lessons from DriBath to commercialization and people .
One lesson we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at large .
They just buy it under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cigarettes . He buys a jar of cigarettes because it &apos;s more important .
So we put DryBath in this creative slice .
You put it in between and out .
And the cool thing is , a simple contract is only in five days .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot about the waste of manufacturing .
We even want DriBath to be there â€” ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million letters of water whenever they leave , and we could save two houses for children , which is two houses , more than two houses for school , more than two houses for children .
After seeing the global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out of our crucial values , transparency and conservation .
DriBath is a servant of a smart man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re now in the process of setting this up , and we &apos;re actually in the process of setting this up for a multinational branding that can be sold in the retail market , and one question I &apos;m going to talk to you about today is , on the Limpopo county , in one week , among the 50th anniversary of an Atlantic platform that doesn &apos;t have to cut the world off .
Are you crying ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet , I haven &apos;t done it yet .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I learned a lot from this recent process , Google announced me last year as the world &apos;s oldest youth .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest entrepreneur in the world &apos;s first African student to have this account , and one thing that amazes me , and it &apos;s all about why I didn &apos;t want to regret . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m here today to give you some of the results that are out there , and I was surprised to myself what are the actual reasons why organizations succeed , which is because of the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you select a group of people with equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will get the human capabilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why is it that often failure ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know that eventually the most important thing for success .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , including many of my most violent ideas and misconceptions that came to me from some institutions last year .
I wanted to know this because I was starting a variety of different businesses at the age of 12 , January High School , going to school and making solar tools , and then college , when I made a radio telescope .
I graduated from college , and I started a foundation for a software company .
And 20 years ago , the beginning of the Libya , in the last 20 years , we started many more successes , many more successes , and many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to give theorists the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I named my company &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; the old days that you feel about .
With all of a sudden , I thought perhaps the team , the vision , the vision , the vision , the vision , the vision , is much more important .
I never imagined that there would be a speaker here at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan when I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team is important to recognize the ability to navigate from the side of the street .
Each car is an old fact .
So I thought perhaps the most important team had .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have an explicit policy about delivery ?
With him , it seemed to grow up in my mind that what is the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies make a big investment .
Is that the most important thing ?
After that , of course , is it time ?
Did this happen very soon , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s fast , you &apos;re coming , and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or so far , and before , are there so many attacks ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of respect for these five factors in many organizations .
And there were 100 companies in Libya , 100 companies out there , and 100 of them were able to find a scientific result .
So before these ideas are ones , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” they &apos;re all dollars of revenue .
And at the lower level , five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink â€” we were very hopeful , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to figure out all these characteristics , as I think these companies have moved on .
And then in the outsiders of Liberia , I saw weird successes , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a huge investment in new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out , but the most powerful factors were in the success and failure of all these companies , and the result struck me .
The first was the choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent accounts for the difference between success and failure .
The team and the Children &apos;s perspective on the other number , and then , I think , being different , remembering different , is really a third number .
But it &apos;s not really clear , not that the thought doesn &apos;t work , but looking at it and I was surprised that I didn &apos;t think it was the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the business model and the investment that I understand .
I think the commercial model still gets worse , because you can go ahead without a commercial model , and then you can go ahead and make more money in cars .
And investment , if initially low investment , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples of all of these noise polls .
A big success story on Airbnb , as you all know .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of investors looked at this company because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to get a piece of their house ?
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons why gross is so successful is because of the best business model , the best industry , the best guess , and the best business model , is the right time .
This company came in front of these financial problems when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people to respond to the advice they wanted in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in front of us , the best company , the best commercial model , also the best viewer .
However , time was exactly right to make the drivers they needed .
Dragonflies were also aspiring for more resources ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citizarch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 , came when companies wanted to see more grandmothers .
We thought it was great , but in fact , the right time was probably more .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was a linear entertainment company .
We were very excited about this â€” with a lot of colleagues and a wonderful business model , working with some of the great , gifts from Hollywood to the company .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband band was very low .
It was very difficult to watch the videos , you didn &apos;t know what to code on your browser , and eventually this company reached its end in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of code , and more than 50 percent of broadband in the United States , YouTube got the best time .
Great thought , the best of times .
The truth is that YouTube , when it started , had no commercial model .
They didn &apos;t believe it would work .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
The idea is very important .
But perhaps time is critical .
And the best way to justify time is to see if they really are willing to stand up for you .
And trustworthiness is that , what the outcome isn &apos;t from them , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but in terms of time , you have to work very , very carefully .
As I said earlier , initial organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help us increase your chances of success , and then it won &apos;t happen in the second best manner of the world .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best audience .

&#91; On the third of September 2016 we saw the greatest data in history &#93; &#91; Fifth storytelling devoted to brilliant and powerful people &#93; &#91; spending a lot of money on non-governmental companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Gulf Voters to the World Heritage Convention . &#93; &#91; This week , the revolution was at the center of the Library
Fifty of them were reported by law enforcement agencies from small shell companies .
We have the inner stories of the villages , the banks and the villages , who come in with the funeral finance companies and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a household company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can see a text message , you can see a way of doing it , how they work .
It starts to appear .
The CEO of East Lindland is extremely familiar .
We also have the news that perhaps the most successful dictators are the descendants of Alaska .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of stolen goods goes to the central mile of Russia through his childhood friend , a famous network .
And a lot of smart people are going to be infected , and the ones that are coming back are going to be further and further hidden documents .
Now this tells a story of a magician , or a novel by John Jesus .
What do we do about it ?
But the truth is that aggressive and powerful people are sitting in their pockets , and the more they ought to be taxed , meaning that fast-forward practices such as health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , GBM , this is a surprising discovery .
Global media and political leaders are talking about how people have influenced their companies that we &apos;ve been discovering over our decades .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful , wonderful world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s sort of like Russian girls .
You can go to another company , another company , one company , and you can almost figure out who is behind this thing .
It &apos;s very difficult to understand why institutions like Texas , the press , the school , the Soyuz , are doing this .
I think it &apos;s also interesting in the United States that we haven &apos;t talked about .
Maybe it &apos;s because the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be in the censorship .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t think about investing in smart companies .
And the reason it works is because there are several companies in the United States of Moscow .
I think if we look at the discoveries of Kim Illinand or Delel Viewer or Mountain View or Christmas , those are the kinds of things that America &apos;s relationship is all about .
But a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give a lot of information , they need less information to run the company than they do in the literary paper .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
Nine military investments are making it easier .
We &apos;re all affected by this .
Now in the Gulf Votes , we wanted to see how it was made .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we took a sabbatical and we sent 13 U.S. intelligence companies .
Our heritage as an African minister wanted to move the village across the United States to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The heart note was that all of the villages could provide an injection of how the classroom could move their teeth .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make any money , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but it was a disaster of the system .
It &apos;s also important that it hasn &apos;t been personalized .
It &apos;s not about private camels that have talked about our obsession with cheating and guesswork .
It &apos;s not just about a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which ticks us down , protects us from poverty , poverty and insurance .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it hard to create .
It can be ideal , so that what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , people who are smart and empowered will continue .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the next few years , we &apos;re moving towards transparency , where the power of the company is .
This issue was launched on a political issue , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Department reviewed the eight centimeters that happened in the southern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been building Vienna on a climate level , which is a central record of who &apos;s actually in Europe or who &apos;s controlling it .
The evidence is that the E.U. is behind it .
The difference in terms of the distribution of law proportions is in the center and the center of the network , which we didn &apos;t want higher , so we were five .
They want to look at inventions , larger sectors , which have been used throughout the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Gulf Ventinas .
We need to reach out to the people who are familiar with the markets behind barbed wires .
Let &apos;s face it , let &apos;s face it , that it &apos;s not good for us to do that .
Politicians need to adjust this issue , and they need to advocate for changing the law to transparent information .
And together we can violate this pattern by bringing the silk between creation and classrooms together .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lucas , your invention , has made a very high impression in the last few years that most of the media in the world are better .
Can it be true ?
Julie Song : Yeah , can it be true ?
It &apos;s an investigation . Isn &apos;t it ? That evidence that worldwide media is showing inexorably low performance , that employees are able to contribute a small group of individuals to information like information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does it happen ?
How do people make arrangements ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julian Sangu : Yeah , there they are . I can tell you that . They serve in the right way , and we have a lot of ways to get the information to us .
So we &apos;re using a lot of high-tech storage to shift materials from one place to the Internet , to interrogate them with legal requests , like Sweden and Belgium .
We get the data from the cloud , from ordinary data , from Rams Square , or whatever , typically news organizations organizing it , forming it â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive amounts of information for the public and then protecting yourself against legitimate and political beliefs .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Sanguay : It &apos;s right , we always get it , and if we get it on a road , we quickly extract information from the skin .
( Phone ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think that &apos;s the kind of question that people are asking , what is the code for TED ? ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we could look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and then what happened ?
Julian Sangu : Yeah . So this is a king report .
This was a secret magazine that the government of Kenya prepared after the Alliance in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was up there for 18 years .
He was a soft fan of Kenya .
And when the book came out â€” because of the private authorities that were trying to run from Kenya , they spent 20 million pounds on this report card and one more report .
And then the government posted on it and used it to resist its political well-being , which was the smartest man â€” now the smartest person in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why it was launched in 2007 , and we were successful in getting this out of the fine election before December 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after that new president , Kabul decided to volunteer with the person he was giving to Daniel Arp Miew so that he became a reporter and put him in the corner of Cairo .
CA : And â€” so , I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s â€” it &apos;s buried in Kenya , not from the commodities , but from the middle and the middle , it &apos;s changed the result .
Julian Sangu : Yeah . This is the headlines of Guardian , and then it occurred in all the major countries of Kenya , in the news of Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from outside .
And he trusted Kenya , a few months later , to talk about it .
And this car sits on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the volume , based on an online gender report in Kenya , and it changed the result of that .
CA : Wow , so your secret interpretation changed the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re going to show a little clip of a tiny , giant cross-border video .
Here &apos;s a little video .
This â€” I &apos;ll tell you , this is a high-definition video .
Radio : ... humility , when you first saw them â€” two brushes .
I saw , oh , there are four with them .
It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s okay . Galen &apos;s gone .
When they &apos;re in front of you , tell me . Go ahead .
Hello .
Hold on , hold on !
( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running .
Hunting . Hunting Master 2 , Hunting Master 2 .
We should be running out of time !
Okay , we killed eight people .
Here we see two old Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still growing plants .
Roger . They &apos;re on my side .
Two , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what about society . Was it Europe ?
God bless you , Hello . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what happened ?
Julian Sangu : Who did this work was very powerful .
We eventually got two people involved in this .
It was the first in three dimensions that happened in this case .
CA : So 11 people were killed in this attack , right ?
Juliet Sung : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two young children were kidnapped .
In total , 18 out of 26 people were killed .
CA : And after that , there was a lot of outrage .
What was the fundamental reason that regret used to be , you think ?
Julian Song : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with a tremendous amount of energy disbalance .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the galleries , and then one kilometer away , the Hilly Capter begins to scratch the surface of 30 miles per hour of electricity on either side â€” whatever it is â€” and they give birth to children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t rich in any way , because they were conscious .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Brodel Mining was awarded , and it &apos;s said that he announced in the Detroit Rome that he gave this video to you about 280,000 and a half American jurisdiction .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Song : So we decided to accept the document .
Five days ago , it appeared that 150,000 documents were received and 50 .
But we &apos;ve now given them a copy of Rome and the American safety house in the beginning of the year , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of accessories from the U.S. safety nets .
Julian Song : We &apos;re going to give them what we &apos;re going to do . ( CA : Y &apos;all going to do ? ) Julian Song : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Song : Because these things show that actually , right now , what the Arab government is going to do is fight human rights violations .
If you look at the evidence , the materials in this body are in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy normally ?
Why would you want to know that information ?
Julian Song : So the question is how important information is in the world , how information can be transformed .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They spend a lot of money on how to run a business , and it &apos;s a great indication that when you want to get the information out , you hope to do something good with it , because what companies know better , and they know about it , they care about it too .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks involved in individually or collectively modified societies where innovation doesn &apos;t exist ?
Julian Sangu : We did not do what we have with them .
I mean , our big impact is our big impact .
With information , we can measure the information in a very specific way that &apos;s personal â€” the information that &apos;s available to somebody else .
But there are also some mysteries â€” your physician has your information ; there &apos;s a mystery â€” but we &apos;re talking about these civil servants that come in and out of poverty .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing it with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to do about it , for example , you think , the father of someone whose daughter is applied to the U.S. State , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had something so powerful that some people like to hug each other .
It shows an American scientific heritage on dead people .
Which has impacted â€” but it has made millions of people worldwide that the United States is political .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? Would you answer ?
Julie Song : Here &apos;s how we get asked a lot of questions like this .
But remember , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people â€” you don &apos;t need to watch a video , they look at it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference in their feelings , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference in their literature .
Because they look at everything .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and their thinking that gives us all the money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re looking at hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But don &apos;t you think it &apos;s ridiculous that in order to pursue this light , you have to maintain yourself in the same way that you do ?
JH : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not all different species .
We don &apos;t have the kind of information that &apos;s excluded from other minds .
If they do that , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to grow up later on .
CA : I mean , I think we &apos;ve all heard about it â€” it &apos;s got to come from strangers here .
You might also assume that there will be different kinds of breakthroughs about Luck and Julie .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or we can make problems .
What is the view of the hero ?
And what are the problems ?
Julie Song : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : These are very good people , Jules , very good .
We &apos;re going to have to try . Today , they &apos;re going to show you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is old , isn &apos;t it ?
What is that ?
Julian Song : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year â€” November , there were a lot of important Russians in the bananas , as in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report â€” which was a very nice experiment about it â€” where I was told that in fact , conservation agencies had a lot of different counterfeit companies , they had run there and they had buried .
And it was done by the Spanish government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report , so it was a very difficult thing for us .
We didn &apos;t know who he was writing and what it was about .
So we were surprised that perhaps this company had done all of this in a competition .
At the foundation we gave it up , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
This stuff is fine , and I look it right , but we can &apos;t imagine it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the same week that he wrote , and he wanted to figure out what the hell it was . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to figure out what the hell it is . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how successful you are legally owned by it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they brought it to us , looking at Scripture with the name of texture , with the name of Microsoft and iPod .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s one way of predicting and predicting what materials are , and that is that they &apos;re trying to write a letter from these people .
CA : All right . So , any information from within B.C.
Julian Sangu : Yeah , we have a lot of stuff , I mean , at that time , we &apos;re collecting a bunch of stuff , and we &apos;re dealing with it in a very difficult way .
That &apos;s why our desire to evacuate , in a matter of months , has become somewhat more comfortable because we improve our bucket system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s rainwater .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s already beginning , we &apos;re much more empowered because of our greater capacity , and that means that we have a vast amount of civic services in the population , very smart , but we don &apos;t have people who can organize this information and make it real .
CA : So that &apos;s actually a problem , why mostly a few veteran or journalist aspirations ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very hard to solve because the materials that we have with our body , so we need to reorganize ourselves so that we can bring people together , we have to develop a lot of sensitivity about the materials of the system , and then we have a little bit of sensitivity about things .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us a little bit about your own self and how you got to the job .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sangu : Yeah , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the north , so both of them were influenced .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so it &apos;s just saying that all things together can produce artificial intelligence .
JH : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were a young adult , and you got into the workshop very quickly .
Julie Song : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist worker from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time , and when this crime hit me , I was stunned .
That &apos;s why you need the word to be able to use the word .
I mean â€” there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at that time , it &apos;s only Russian mafia that can actually transform your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , isn &apos;t the word that it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are , and perhaps some of the things in your life that helped them do ?
Julie Song : I don &apos;t believe in the reality .
But basic values : good , powerful and evil people are not born to impressions ; they are growing .
And that &apos;s the bedrock that I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and brave people that live in my life .
Chris Anderson : Can &apos;t possibly be a powerful and generative person reproduce them ?
Julian Sangu : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed man , so I &apos;m not very good at agriculture , but somehow â€” there &apos;s another way of raising the pesticide , which is approaching police department .
And this is what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : So we &apos;ve got to just say this in the last few minutes : What happened in Iceland ?
Basically you did something here , you had a problem with a bank , and then the newspapers gave the story a little bit of controversy .
Instead , they gave you status .
That &apos;s why you became so famous in Arizona . So what happened ?
Julie Song : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ace November was a financial crisis .
There was the highest .
That &apos;s where the banking was growing at 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that in July last year .
And the state of Tehran ran ran ran ran five minutes before it was released , as a movie : &quot; The state of the art of the imperial press released , and the state of the newspaper was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spent all of the time , and we became very famous in the Iceland , I went to the Iceland and talked about it .
And those were the things that people didn &apos;t want to be again , and as a result , the CEOs of the South Landers , some of them working with international Mhernalists , we named the Asian Leand of a different kind of law , which was a kind of liberal media law , which is why journalists around the world have the most protected , new Nepal pal pal pal pal pal pal pal pal law .
A North African country is like a nursery , which is the top of the system .
And a month ago , the Asian Parliament considered it carefully .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look towards the future , do you realize that the most expected thing to show is power and power , greater generosity , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to hit us ?
Julie Song : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will come .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure to counter the law of liberty and the law of transparency around the world â€” in Europe , in China and the United States .
What &apos;s going to happen ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live â€” because with a small effort , we can go one way or another .
CA : All right , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience into what they call , the judges , the honor , and all the power you have .
JH : Thank you , Chris Anderson : Thank you . ( Applause )
I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is a milestone .
I would watch my childhood Connecticut regimes , and I would watch them cry in the mosque .
When I was growing up in college and came home in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team was stuck .
And when I looked at it from a kind of lush standpoint , I realized how the rest of the world thought about it ?
And when I went to the mini-mart , wherever I went , the surprise was that North Carolina , Pice , or London , repeatedly in the mini-mart , there were four creatures covered by â€” good , tuna , silence and code .
And I thought this was a big bizarre thing , and I was surprised to see if anybody had ever had this secondary medium .
And when I went to see it , I realized people weren &apos;t looking at the Catholic team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To confine the natural world into a few elements , there is no unusual human character .
This is a piece we did 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , they &apos;ll look at you as being rocky and robust ; you &apos;ll see all kinds of organisms .
But if you look back 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cars , trucks , trucks and buses .
It &apos;s also true of strangers .
You &apos;re going to look at New York City &apos;s paths 150 or 200 years ago at a mini-mart ; you &apos;re going to see cartoons , bricks and southerners .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four years old â€” the circle , the circle , the heel , but also the Mermaid .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Shah .
This is a brand new problem .
And then 50 years from now , we &apos;re doing that .
The Second World War has given us a tremendous amount of admiration .
During the Second World War , we &apos;ve advanced technology such as the Sun , the Polynesian , and so on and so forth , all of these things have taken place .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see the tremendous increase in the capacity for months .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that military farming and sea farming has increased , and within a couple of years its result has increased greater than concentration .
Now if you add fertilizer and forest pollution , this will be equivalent to two Chinese births per year from the sea .
My favorite example of the Chinese co-author isn &apos;t one , because China is not just one of the largest retailers , but it &apos;s also one of the largest retailers .
So now they go to their four choices .
The first is the most utilized salt in the United States and the West .
Forests loss is an incredibly bad resource .
Only one foot of deforestation kills fish , 10 , 15 pounds of deforestation .
Language is an incredibly complicated subject .
In a study done in Darwinian university , it proved that methane from gas was extremely inefficient to extract carbon from methane .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where battlefields live in the remote areas are the mangroves .
Now look at these cute little girls .
It puts the foot of the earth into its place , protected the beaches , the lakes and the hunter-gatherers of all kinds of important things for the environment .
A lot of years ago , this happened with the Mongolian war .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years building millions of coastal plants .
Another action that &apos;s here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the tropics right now , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now , there are several reasons why left-handed people are losing sleep , but with it , a very large number of other leopard seals are falling apart and turning food into lava .
And many times , they work from the slums , which are named after the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means that the ecological system itself is playing around and playing around .
The next big food in the U.S. and the West is wasted .
Titan is a global campaign .
You need to look at large areas in order to organize fractally .
Our own area , what the real philosopher manufacturers call &quot; &quot; ICCAT . &quot; &quot; The online command for protecting electronic tattoos .
Carl Sphenomenon also established a great deal of learning about this .
We can do TV footage , but it &apos;s not good for tuna fishermen .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tattoos are warm blood .
It absorbs over 40 miles per gallon and can heat up to 20 degrees above ambient temperature .
All of the benefits of 12 months are almost over .
A fresh blood vessel supply is a loss of blood vessels that no longer feeds .
It &apos;s great for protons .
But the forest creature , 40 miles long , cannot be stored in the forest .
Sime has gotten good , it doesn &apos;t require that it &apos;s gotten worse .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was breaking down .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot has a diameter .
In the politics of Connecticut , there are 3,000 of them .
In fact , I say connectome is bigger than people . ( Laughter ) If anybody has opened the connectome , I think we can make the world a lot better .
And everywhere there are ladies , these are rockets that propel the desert to give to their children .
As a result , we have a success story on the front lines and on the front lines .
When the space shuttle began , the space shuttle was spent six pounds to build a foundation .
But now it &apos;s getting better .
Otherwise , there &apos;s a little bit of false water as well , because if you look at the footprint on the footprint , they drop the footprint on a football game .
Whereas this information is recycled from the beginning .
It &apos;s hard to say something about parallel and parallel .
But then the Soviet Union advanced the manufacturing industry , which made it a little bit easier for us to shift FedEx .
It &apos;s a system producing acousticians , and it &apos;s flooding from Jupiter .
This goes back seven percent a year .
Even though we &apos;re spending enough money to go to market , we &apos;re spending less money , but then we &apos;re spending a lot of money .
We &apos;re not just eating milk ; we &apos;re also eating milk and eggs .
We have things that are starting to eat , and things that are starting to eat .
Because on top of it , the blood and the bars and so on and so forth add bullets .
I wonder if there &apos;s a lesson he did , but that lesson broke out .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of deforestation that are coming out of the ocean .
This is the third part of China , or the number of people in the United States every year out of the sea .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philosynthesis actually started as lions .
And it began to look like a local finance owner noticed that the next day nobody would ever be on a McDonald &apos;s .
She went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a sanitary pad for you . &quot;
It &apos;s called please .
What &apos;s more likely to be a pencil for the ocean was one indication that Hallelujah did not die .
So he built his liposuction probe .
Unfortunately , the pension was 30 cents .
He wanted to make a 25-cent cent cinema , so he brought the electronic code .
Actually , the Philosophical Science Foundation is the largest mass industry in the United States of America , between two and three billion pounds a year from the sea .
If we stop the policies , maybe the alternative would be tripled .
20 years ago , Thailand had no idea .
This changes the planet &apos;s protein in a very powerful way in animal protein , and this is mine for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; it &apos;s growing from one individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a silly cigarette .
It doesn &apos;t include IBM and DIY , which we think is going to live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
Which represents a large part of 300 million tons .
One possibility of conservation is that we can eat it ?
Can we find a way to give it to peace instead of giving it to peace ?
There are reasons for that .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , where the average elite is the result of losing jobs , and the most effective elite is the top .
This is among the top three , EPA and DIY .
So this is her ability .
But what if we took this path and instead of giving away a few dollars from Pandora or Petton and turned it into a football game and turned it into a football field and started playing double-clothes , could we figure out a way to open that gap ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much higher rates of EPAD and DDI .
The Indus calculus is very effective .
Indonesia &apos;s meat is only three parts per million .
Actually , it &apos;s about three months old . It doesn &apos;t come out of the sea .
Ocean space creates three vertical axis in the Milky Way , so they just come together .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western world , we &apos;ve been eating coins because of the use of Facebook and the use of Newfoundland .
Over the next two decades , more than 400 deaths have been produced , these are the major causes of death in ocean life .
As you might think about the video , in all these different modes , protons and , on average , three numbers are extremely effective .
It &apos;s just like the real thing .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a facility that can provide benefits to the optimism bias .
These creatures should be green blood cells , growing fast and altering environments like their own capabilities , and they would like to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Facebook .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about it , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it all .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is about 30 million in the ocean .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think about understanding without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a little bit of a roller coaster .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was there to reveal the large brain because I have a brother who is affected by mental illness .
More and more , I wanted to understand , as a scientist , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they disconnect their dreams to the public and to the truth and they act on it .
So I set out to study serious illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from India , where I worked at the President Francis Bank , which was in the halls of Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in the mathematical level in the brain of people who generally think of themselves as being compared to the brain of people who are in Scottish , or Boulder Doc , or Boulder Doc ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is we &apos;re trying to make a map of the microbial map of the brain , where the cells are communicating with the chemical and the chemical volume of the
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this research on the day , but perhaps on a weekly basis , I was on a pilgrimage of NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intellectual 10 .
There was a nine foot in the left side of my brain .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely dissolved by any ability to understand information .
In the morning of February , I was able to write and recall .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from one another .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the last part of the brain that &apos;s sitting there with the back of the brain , and it &apos;s going to sit in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely separate from each other .
For those of you who think about computers , on the right part of our brain operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain operates like a solar system .
These two pieces are transferring messages to each other through the cross-cultural record that some 300 volunteers have taken .
But in addition to that , they &apos;re both absolute hogens .
Because they think of information in different ways , knowledge has to be understood in all sorts of different information , their facial expressions , and you allow them to be personally different from one another .
Encouragement â€” thank you very much .
Interviewer : Yeah , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
( Laughter ) Our brains are only a fraction of the time and we think about it .
Right now , the brain is thinking in part of our brain , and it &apos;s thinking organically about the movements of our body .
Information is stored in and restored in our bodies over the course of our whole neuroscience system , and then it &apos;s folded into a giant aluminum class that gives us an idea of what the current moment is and what it is in mind to feel and to listen .
I am an energy bound by the energy of my surroundings by the right brain .
We are the energy systems that are moving from each other through the perception of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers from this planet who are contributing to a better world .
And at this point , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a very different place .
Our right brain is thinking scientifically and mentally .
The left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that we take our greatest aluminum / clay away from it and start collecting the analyses .
And it also informs the organization and distribution of all these things that we &apos;ve learned in the past , and determines the possibilities of the future , namely , on our models .
The left part of our brain is thinking in language .
It &apos;s a conversation with us and our inner world that deals with the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me how to go home and buy and remember .
I need them in the morning . It &apos;s the awareness of me writing my computer book , which reminds me of my book .
But perhaps the most important voice is the one that says , &quot; I ! I am ! &quot;
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become separate .
I am the only person in the world who has access to tremendous amounts of energy and energy around you .
And the only part of my brain that morning was filtered with a flight .
My left eye in the morning of the philosopher &apos;s aftermath , with an injection of pain .
It was as painful as a sight of an awe .
And that pain drove me like I did and left .
And he left and went .
For me , it was extraordinary . I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I walked around and I looked at my cardboard gallery , which is a previous body training machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , and it makes me feel like my hand is the five-year-old man who moved to Denda .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , I think I feel so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness changes , the general sense of being a human being , that the machine is moving from this experience , but now I was somewhere mysterious and mysterious where my conscious@@
And it was all very strange , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started walking around the room , and I felt like everything was going on inside my body .
And everyone understands very difficult and very thinkable .
There &apos;s no connection in my vehicle , and I think there &apos;s a housing going on , so I &apos;m just focused on the inner system .
I &apos;m growing up in my underwater house , running underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , and I have to play you now .
You bend my foot , and then I &apos;m not balancing my balance , I &apos;m scratching the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that now I can &apos;t define my body &apos;s impact .
I don &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped because my hand was held together by atoms and magnetic walls .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my left brain , the whole thing was quiet .
It &apos;s like someone was speaking the voice of T.V. radio .
A memory .
So before that , I was surprised by the sadness of my brain .
But then immediately , there was another energy in this huge space flight that was around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came to the front of my brain and he said to me , &quot; Come on , you &apos;re a victim . &quot;
We need to help him , and I told myself , I &apos;m really removed from any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really removed from the problem , but I came back regularly in the same way that I often talk about .
But they were so beautiful .
Think about how beautiful it is to be in a place where you are totally interconnected with this tiny brain that is keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my wrist and my heart is pushing forward .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And calculate all of your relationships from the outside world , and any of them have been degraded .
And I felt a sense of peace and quiet .
And measure what it would look like if you went back to that 37 years ago with the emotional weight you were holding .
( Laughter ) Oh , I sort of set up a vegetable foot .
It was very beautiful .
And then my brain turned to the left of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow ! Two hands .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking I should be helping , so I brought necklace from home , and I went to my apartment , and I &apos;m now walking into my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , can I drive a car ? &quot; &quot; And at that point , my hand was completely disillusioned .
At that moment , I realized that my God was attacking me from college , the next thing that my mind was telling me is how cool it is !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who &apos;s going to find this opportunity to realize their own brain , and they &apos;re going to â€” ( Laughter ) â€” and then one blood came to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very , very busy woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into college . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t fix the college campaign , but in a two-week period I &apos;ll return to my normal . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job . Then I remembered that I had a business card with my phone number .
So I go into my studio room and I create a three-story motorcycle card .
And I look at the top card , even though I can see from my brain &apos;s eyes clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card I &apos;m not , because I don &apos;t look at the dots .
And the maps of the words will be helped by the maps of the paper and the marks , and I wasn &apos;t doing anything .
Then I started waiting for him to tell me about his situation .
And at that point , the general was repeated , and I was learning that it wasn &apos;t a card . It wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this graph .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the impacts on the left were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any path .
So I take the phone and I put it there .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the big bubbles on the phone , and they &apos;re shaped like little bubbles .
But then I switch to my own hallucinations when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I had that number , that I didn &apos;t .
So I put my hand up like a Danish , and I put it on Hindus and pretended to the other hand that when I came back to the normal truth , I can tell myself I was hurt by the end of India , and I heard that on the phone , a friend of mine got on the phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And you
So I say this in my brain clearly , &quot; I &apos;m talking about men ; I need help . &quot;
And for me , the sound is &quot; &quot; Wooo Woo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; My God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language at that time , and I couldn &apos;t understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And shortly afterwards , one of the ambulances was running the Siq Sharata in Boston on the other side of the hospital .
I walked up and looked like a toddler .
Just like a poor kid who remained wet and was totally out of nowhere , I pulled the energy out and I was feeling helpless .
And it occurred to me at that moment that I was not allowed to live my life .
Or the doctor &apos;s offering me a chance to save me and give me a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I was alive .
When I felt ashamed of my spirit , then I gave life to God .
Now my brain was battling two different facts .
At that time , the emotion of my perceptual system began to dawn on the emotion of pain .
Light shattered my brain like the fire of the forest , and the veins were so close and so bright that I could also understand a voice , or I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , or I could only hear the voice .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body &apos;s questions , so I felt very large and wide , like a person who had been free from their bones .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great evangelical event melted into the ocean of silence .
The Great Divergence .
She &apos;s given me the qualities that she cares about .
And I remember thinking , this could never be possible , that I could love my great identity and capture the capacity of the small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive and depressed .
And if I &apos;m nervous , and I &apos;m alive now , so whatever life is , I can get nerves , and I &apos;ve seen a world like this that lives with beautiful , transparent , comfortable and loving people who know that they can sometimes feel that quality .
And they can choose to live and choose , and the right thing is that they want to take their books off the left side of their brain and step on their own search for transparent quality .
And then I realized how much this experiment could provide as a gift . &quot; &quot; This is the lesson of the text that he taught me to live his life .
And he gave me permission to be healthy .
After the Cold War , the southern hemisphere erased the same amount of blood from my brain , which was concentrated in the low capacity of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
It will take me eight years to be perfectly healthy .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life in the universe with a handful of skills and two extremely high minds .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can step right into my consciousness at the same time .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful mammalian cells are found in one form , including all of them .
Or I can choose to step back to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual , &quot; in a tight way .
From cosmic rays , &quot; &quot; The algorithm .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And who ?
And I think as long as we spend our left-hand corners of the right brain , we &apos;re going to extend world peace and our planet is going to be a lot more sustainable .
And I thought it was necessary to solve this idea .
Thank you .

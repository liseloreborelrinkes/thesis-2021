Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They called my name Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , just about 18 years ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was forced to eat .
So I asked the question , would you like to play in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , because he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Syria ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The violent jihad , the violent jihad . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minneae , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minneae . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Come on .
He was speaking to me with three people , saying to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I will not see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl accurately on top of her . And everywhere .
How can he speak this way ?
So I started thinking .
I &apos;m proud of that .
Sure enough .
What is the right to express my tongue in my country ?
Where can that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I have many people , who are walking to such a death in their lives , who are literally leaving behind every single thing that &apos;s inside them , just because they love the magic and the magic .
Should I be encouraging my whole culture , my thoughts , my thoughts and beliefs ?
We may have the most important memories of war for children .
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
What makes sense ?
However , I tried to figure it out .
I didn &apos;t want to make the same choice as Oz did for me .
The Arabic script does not emphasize today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not the language of Science , or research , the language that we use in uniforms , the language that we use everywhere we work in the language that we rely on when we work on projects for a particular discipline , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at any given time .
If we do that , they will follow our script .
So where can I balance it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want to use Arabic . Where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another more important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is a mother tongue .
Research says that in other languages , we need to transition to our mother tongue .
In other words , it &apos;s the primary condition for the inventive expression of language .
How ?
Gibran Gilbert , when he first started writing , created an Arab statement .
All of their imaginations and imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in these places where she grew up , felt a certain sense of happiness , felt a certain voice , and thought about a particular idea .
So when they started writing in English , they had enough material .
Until , when they wrote in English , when you read their texts in English , you feel the same happiness , you feel the same sense .
And you can imagine that in English they are also teachers , this little boy who was walking in the streets of Livingham .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact of emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China , all of these things are true .
That &apos;s why they set up laws to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re using it in the context , they &apos;re investing a lot of money in their advertisements .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , it &apos;s not until we &apos;re moved on , and we want to move on to the developing world .
They were countries that were like us at a time , but they decided to try to grow up , to research , to reach those countries , as if Turkey , meeting , they spoke with their own language , as if they were chatting girls , as if they were protecting her .
They took it to their neighbors .
Because if you go to Turkey or the source and the source , and it &apos;s not in Turkey , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be involved in these courtyards , unrealistic arenas , like we are more time .
So in order to innovate and innovate , they needed to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Cyrus , selfishness , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you learn ?
What would you find ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how , how .
Languages aren &apos;t just about communication , words are about us .
Language is a symbol of the particular stages in our lives , and the words that come from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , selfishness , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you creates a special place in your brain — special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not about giving one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that belongs to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What do we think ?
How are you going to understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the freedom of the English ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , then I &apos;d better leave and spend a lot of time uncomfortable talking .
It &apos;s that these impacts teach us something special .
My friend is a French speaker , who &apos;s very happy with a French speaker .
There was a time when it was happening .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I spent a little bit of time trying to translate it into an attempt to translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An innocent woman called it &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He wondered , how could someone be so cool ?
Does she want to make herself ?
Bury Me . ( English ) ( Cheers ) This is one of many examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t think of his wife as meaning this word , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought about it was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he calls me firefighters , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I feel when I sing the firefighter . &quot; &quot; Beautiful women tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; So I raised my hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I put my hands on and you leave
It translates . It gives me perspective .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to speak Arabic ?
We turned it into a way of thinking about society and we began to speak Arabic .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Whether it &apos;s suffering , let &apos;s stop . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The key to the conservation of Arabic has given a voice , which is , &quot; I speak to you from the East , but you speak from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because , like , we don &apos;t think it would .
And if anyone says to me , I hate Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be confident in the way that our dreams , our desires , our daily lives .
It &apos;s how we feel and how we think .
So this quote , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the East , but you are speaking to the West . &quot; &quot; Put it right .
It &apos;s very easy , but it &apos;s good and efficient .
After that , we started another important event with the landscape of letters .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , a landscape in which the words of black and yellow are sitting at the roof of the text , with the translation , &quot; Make language kill . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We should not really kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have an understanding .
We have to work for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very easy to play when it &apos;s new and exciting .
Then we took Arabic scripts of boys and girls .
Cole images of boys and girls .
We are so proud .
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve created the word &quot; &quot; colleague &quot; &quot; in my soul . &quot; &quot; They want to protest as much as they want to do two , but I have the same word that &apos;s good and equal to reality .
I don &apos;t say &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; as I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the middle of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not museums . We don &apos;t want to hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we need to tell everybody that we &apos;re not going to let anybody grow up or think that we have access to language , force us to push , or force us to question our patients and to think .
We have to invent our imagination .
So , if we can &apos;t reach home , or we can &apos;t repair the rocket , we can still be creative .
At that time , every single one of you is an innovative project .
You have to invent in the mother tongue .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a nano or make a short film .
A single neuron can then reach us globally .
He can re-invent Arabic in the first place .
Well , it &apos;s not like there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s solutions .
But we &apos;ll have to know that , and we have to say that the solution exists , part of the solution , is our assumption .
Last but not least , what can you do today ?
How many of you are tweeting ?
To be violent , I urge you , even though my time is running out , or Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But numbers don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin word .
( Applause ) It &apos;s true ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a computational language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to understand the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child speaks English for the first time .
When my daughter was born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , and I &apos;ve gone from my daughter &apos;s light to the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot;
And it &apos;s not expected that no one &apos;s going to get it . ( Applause ) You get it from the cultural press . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that it reminds us that our presence is not a secret , I was shocked by those negative devices that protect my people , because until you see my generation , we don &apos;t see the voices of the future , and we don &apos;t have to take this generation of inequality and turn it over to our generation when they don &apos;t have the voice to confirm destruction ,
( Applause )
My favorite is C.O.s .
In college , my basic anatomy was Gortenment , which meant I had to write a lot of material .
Now a typical person , when they write something , will do something .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do a little bit of behavior early on , but last week you &apos;re doing a lot of work and a lot of work later , everything &apos;s fine , so it &apos;s fine . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;d like to do that too .
It &apos;s going to be my way .
My answer is all sorts of things , but actually the job of motivation starts with it , and then something like that happens .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all the inspiration work .
And then comes the new paradigm of exponential research , the motivational work that you &apos;re doing in one year .
And I knew that my public behavior was uncomfortable with this .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , and I decided I would do something like this .
Something like this will happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , in the middle , the behavior of work is going to grow , and eventually I &apos;m going to zoom in on it more like a student .
How hard is it to learn to read ?
No big deal , right ?
Then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
It &apos;s gone and gone , and I can &apos;t do anything more .
So we created a project twice .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then the medical advice would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in the David Lynn , and I didn &apos;t write a word yet , and then what I could do was I put 90 pages in 72 houses , put down two pages of issues , did nothing to do — people don &apos;t have to go on two streets of issues — put on two streets of issues of issues , spent a second time in the compound
I thought , now it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I was produced and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the paper . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;ll look at it today , that &apos;s the best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe it . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be grateful for that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they do a lot .
No , I &apos;m blogging today .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m blogging , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the system .
My roommate is constantly giving me six dollars , and I wanted to tell the six people what &apos;s happening in the brain of the senior people and why we are .
Now my argument was that the brain of the simple people is different than the brain of six people .
Knowing that I &apos;ve developed a liver where I &apos;ve been able to prove both brains in the same way and the left brain , so that I can confront them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you water .
I want you to look at me and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , it &apos;s not that hideous , but there &apos;s also a vision .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s different .
Both of them have intellectual decisions in their brains , but the brain of the human mind is entertaining .
Now what does this mean for a test ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; This is the best time to achieve work &#93; &#91; Go ! &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The intellectual intellectual decision is going to make some sense , but the father doesn &apos;t like this project , so he &apos;s going to take the commands , and he says , &quot; &quot; Keep your eyes on the screen . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to make a profit and a ton of Harvard , because I think that &apos;s already happening .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to go to the puzzle and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After that , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which is beginning to talk about the range of TEDsters , and much later , I &apos;m going to end up watching the Internet as mothers of Tony Bobber .
( Laughter ) There will be some time in all of those things , so there won &apos;t be any time to do anything today .
What &apos;s going to happen ? ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the foundation of philanthropy that you want to believe .
It just wants to live in an existing place .
It seems to me that the future has nothing to do with just two things : ease and gratitude .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you can , and you live your life well and easily , then you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Good to eat , good to think , and increase the generation , that sounds like this .
But if you haven &apos;t done anything , you haven &apos;t been very far away .
We &apos;re an increasingly ambitious species , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a conscious decision maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;ve been thinking far .
We build big projects .
And he &apos;s thinking about all those things .
And it &apos;s only with us that we want to be happy to do .
Sometimes brotherhood seems to be just as good as eating easily and pleasurely , thinking or giving in to opportunities .
So there &apos;s a problem .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the paradox of the planet .
And for solitary people , this contradiction always leads to the same thing , which spends a lot of time in small rooms , a simple and frustrating way that thinks that are out of place .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) The dark place is the place where people are so well-known .
Forgiveness is a dream when you don &apos;t have to be compassionate .
In the dark sphere , what you find is no longer useful , in fact , because it &apos;s not true , space is filled with feelings of mass , fear , enthusiasm , and feelings of hatred — all the properties that are in the system .
The question is , in this case , when birth is flooded , how does the system get into the blooded vessel , which is unfortunately important ?
It turns out that systems also provide protection , which protect them every time in their dark spaces — somebody mentioned it at home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly driven , but when David Lynn gets near , it gets so awake or so when people are at risk of embarrassment , disliking or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the building only works .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because a few months ago , people at TED had called me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Apparently I did .
I was sleeping at TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something else going on in the brain of intellectual decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; So he said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at India &apos;s role in less than 200 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the village open when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So this day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , and a month later , people at TED decided to sign the names of the authors .
I picked up the website and it was my visualization I was getting .
And how did that become ?
( Laughter ) The house that was built , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he &apos;s frightened of the house , he &apos;s fine on the tree .
And finally , and finally , the intellectual decision-making has come together and I can start talking .
Now the homework assignment that every person in the body has articulated is awkward , like me , how someone like me would go for two weeks , and the beginning of the article can &apos;t be heard , and then wonderfully , the unbelievable success of the process leads to unbelievable success over the night and write articles .
And the three-fold supply chain is what &apos;s called the system of successful people .
It &apos;s not very good ; it &apos;s not sustainable .
And a few years ago , I decided to write blogs about this .
When I wrote this , it struck me how it affected him .
In fact , I &apos;ve got thousands of products from around the world and from people , from all walks of life .
They included bankers , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and also CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody was telling me one thing and saying , &quot; I &apos;m in trouble too . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and missing email questions .
In the teaching of these people , Milo was lying to learn how much he could do in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , then what happens ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
It turns out there are two ways to go .
Today , the examples I gave you , who were talking about subjects , were all data lines .
And when the data is online , recent effects are crucial because the home that drives it .
But the system has a second component , and it doesn &apos;t depend on any digital lens .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like some kind of arts or businesses — like some kind of arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start cutting yourself in order to get behavior done .
In addition to that , there are so many things that don &apos;t fit together with David Lynn , like moving with his family , exercise , envision your health , understanding your relationships , telling your relationships to tell the truth that you can &apos;t stand with .
Now , if the only way you can do a bad job is to find homework , it &apos;s difficult , because all of those data points are actually locked inside the house .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it , and recent effects are that you can &apos;t deliver them , they &apos;re always with water .
And this is a typical calendar that comes out of very little to watch and talks about rather than criminal gangsters , rather than criminal gangsters .
You &apos;re good at creating bad news .
And that could be the case for traditional wealth and reputation .
So I thought that was the reason they wanted to send , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban recruitment has made them look , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot afford to sleep , but that they cannot afford to cooperate .
I read all the texts , and one thing came out — I think there are no chess people .
I think you &apos;re all people .
It may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of the data from the Upper right now is good for links , but remember the challenges when there &apos;s no digital curve .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the cylinder of life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
They &apos;re not very uncomfortable , especially when something of them is expensive .
I think we all need to have a brilliant hacker .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing because nobody &apos;s ever going to make a living .
We need to be careful with the cause of fun .
It &apos;s essential for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have a home yet , so maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s crap .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One day in the United States and Afghanistan , a handful of Afghan refugees were moving from one place in Afghanistan to another in order to help protect an office in Afghanistan so that they could protect an office in order to help protect an office in Afghanistan to help protect an office in order to protect an office in order to help protect an Afghan invest in the Afghan sector , in which there were several nations
He came in at the end of an invasion , and he was staying around with three things and he was chasing Catton Savenon with so many things , and he watched as a child staring at the Catton Savenon , and he watched as a child as a child put the chickens over and kill the children .
One of the guys who knew his kids , one of the guards and one of the guards , was climbing towards a helicopter and one of the guards was climbing towards a helicopter .
So it turns out that the clearance of Kepton Synson and Evan takes up this wooden shaft that &apos;s floating around the neck .
They &apos;ve gone to the Hole in the Wall computers and then you can see what the Catin Sagan was doing before they put money on it for the kids .
I looked at this and I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love , and I knew why it &apos;s the way I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , at the moment , you &apos;ve been given a gift to people who want to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In business , we put bonuses on people who want to sacrifice others so that we can benefit .
We have Utah !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my basic result was that these people were better than others .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re looking at the waves .
These are the best people on the job description of the service .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s environmental , and if you &apos;re in a dense environment , each of us has the potential to work together , then each of us has the potential to work together , and increasingly , the ability to do that for others .
I have the privilege of reaching out to some people like this every day and saying , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing because they did it to me .
It &apos;s about trust and cooperation .
So trust and cooperation are important .
The hard thing to imagine trust and cooperation is that it &apos;s emotional , not just humans .
I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; Stay with me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I connect two people and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go around 50,000 years ago at the Petri divide , which means that the early days of Homo sapiens , we see that the world is faced with risk , all of these forces are facing us very hard .
There &apos;s nothing intrinsic about this .
Whether the Muslim Brotherhood is reduced by a set of tools , or a set of tools , these things are all contributing to the decline in our lives , these things are all contributing to the decline in our lives .
And so we looked at the face of social animals where we were standing and working together to create a sense of generosity , like in a tribe where we felt our innate connection .
And when we felt protected from ourselves , we felt empowered and empowered .
It &apos;s independent camels .
That means I can go to night and I can browse to see some of the risks in my tribe .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you there , it means you &apos;re not going to take the risk .
It &apos;s a system for survival .
The new distance looks exactly like this .
These worlds are faced with risk , things that are trying to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
It can be really expensive to build a stock market .
It can be a new technology that you can download your car at night and unload it at night .
Or it could be your opponent , which sometimes tries to get you sucked .
Sometimes you &apos;re struggling to get out of the car , but at least it &apos;s going to steal your brakes and try to get your brakes from you , it &apos;s going to steal your brakes and it &apos;s going to steal your brakes from you .
We have no authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it &apos;s never done .
The only driver of change is conditions that are within a system , and that &apos;s where dignity comes from , because it &apos;s the belief that it determines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and protect the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to sacrifice their identity and their good results so that people are willing and willing to sacrifice their loved outcomes so that people can feel protected and feel protected and feel intimate , so that things happen .
I was on a holiday trip , and I really admitted to the fact that when a passenger did what I tried to do before he found it , and I looked at the staff on the front door to see the staff who had already passed the law just as it had passed the law .
Once upon a time when I tried to grow up , there was a time when I tried to grow up .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you pushing us like machines ?
Why can &apos;t you share the story with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he told me exactly that .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason why we like to travel to the West Bank is not because they &apos;re necessarily better people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t leave their bosses .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and strength protecting ourselves from one another and therefore less regulating .
What &apos;s a giant leader ? &quot; &quot; To her , the brightest example of how to become a parent is what is a good leader for her , the brightest example of how to become a parent .
If you think about how good parents are , what would you want ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to know the opportunities , education , discipline and record of our kids , when necessary , we want to know the opportunities , the education , the order and the record , when necessary , to grow them and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves , to grow them and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what the leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , and when they need it , they want to give them the opportunities , the education , the discipline and the record , and when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to be opportunities for time and failure so that they can make more of the things that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump , and they said one thing : If your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people to come from our organization ?
Charlie lost practical wisdom for the recent meeting .
If you &apos;re visiting Next Jump , you &apos;re not going to go to the base of the work .
But if you have any problem , they &apos;ll look at you and help you , just like we &apos;ll do to a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why some people are so frustrated and angry , some of the clients are sitting at CEOs , and that &apos;s why some people are so frustrated and angry , some of the clients are sitting at CEOs , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re getting so frustrated and so anxious , some of the clients are sitting at CEOs with so much anxiety and so on .
It &apos;s not about numbers .
But they understood the fundamental principles of prudence .
They &apos;ve gone through a whole host of social media .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the victims of their loved ones , but they &apos;ve also given them the victims of their loved ones .
That &apos;s what disagrees with us , not numbers .
Does anyone assume that Gando gave 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t she make 250 million dollars in school ?
Do we have any problems with that ? Absolutely not .
The good teacher will never sacrifice the number for the kids .
The good teacher will never sacrifice the number for the kids .
But they will sacrifice people to make false papers for kids .
At the top of the mini-chip delivery campaign , the Bush chips are running a mini-bottle company called Barry-Wehmiller in 2008 , and he was inspired by the supermarket , and he had 30 percent of his traffic overnight .
Now in a large mini-economics company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy a jar of jam .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , and so many of the companies today are bringing in the brand and and doing the right thing .
And Bob did .
You can see the Bush administration doesn &apos;t trust the Bush administration .
It &apos;s more difficult to get people to lose weight and to reduce congestion .
And then they built a dedicated plan .
That every application , from the Critic to the CEO , was needed to get everybody on board for four weeks .
They could never do that when they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to do that .
But as Boob declared his program , he stayed very serious .
He said it would be better to take small doses of money than some of us would take many , many , many , many people , and it would be great .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and the most important thing is , as people expect , when they feel protected by a system of value , trust and cooperation is empowered .
And just like nobody expected , people started businesses from each other .
They were doing more than 50 business with low-level kids .
I mean , some people took five licenses to get one to three .
Gravity is an abstraction , not a contradiction .
I know so many people who benefit from the most successful organizations , I know so many people who benefit from the most successful organizations which are not the leaders at all .
They &apos;re impatient governments , and we do what they say because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who don &apos;t have any authority and don &apos;t have any authority , and that &apos;s because they have chosen to look at their left side of the person , and that &apos;s because they have helped to look at their left side , and they have helped to look at their right side .
This is a director .
I heard a story about some of the figures that had gone out in the kitchen , and as the way you do fireworks is you eat in the late afternoon and you play your friends before and you don &apos;t have anything to do with it .
And when he returned to the field , his customers gave him some of his food to play because that &apos;s what he did .
We tell them they do it first .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re bringing people risk models first , and we call them leaders because they &apos;re bringing people risk models first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can protect them and so that people can benefit them , and when we do so , it becomes extremely robust that our people will win us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood , their medicine , and they &apos;ll give us a glimpse of their conductor &apos;s sleep , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and your medicine and your health to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because that &apos;s what it does for us . &quot; &quot; And what is it not that order that we all want to do ?
And isn &apos;t that the kind of system that we all want to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up named Motetema in a small spot of Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the supply of water and shelter is so unbelievable , such as the mosque , and growing up in these conditions is so difficult to grow up once every 17 years , I was quietly walking around with friends in the bathroom with friends .
The temperature of the limb is very hot .
And as I was slowing down in the morning , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why doesn &apos;t you create something that doesn &apos;t just sit on the skin and don &apos;t bite you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I went home . &quot; &quot; And I did some research and I had some amazing statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to safety .
Forty-four of them are in Africa , and they &apos;re only in South Africa .
Different diseases cross the environment , one of the most dangerous trachoma .
Trachoma is a reflex in the eye because of loss aversion , and because of loss aversion , you can be independent .
This disease kills millions of people every year on their own , and the most amazing thing about this is that for kids in the trachoma , you only have to drop in your mouth : no elephants , no plants , no organs .
After looking at these thoughts and figures , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing this for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I went from my cousin to 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a 20-second laptop , I did a Google search on Wikipedia ,
And I looked at this as a private challenge to KFC .
So I &apos;m telling you , our paradigm is correct .
Now we need to do that in practice .
Four years later , when the mobile phone on 40 pages , after I wrote my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; now and not gold ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t tell you much more . ( Laughter ) I created DryBath , the world &apos;s first browser .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a skin .
( Laughter ) So after the attempt to make it work in high school and the limited resources that I had , the mentor agent entered some new people , did more of that , and now we have effectively a broadcasting platform that &apos;s available for the market , but now it &apos;s available in the marketplace .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that strangers do not buy products at large .
They &apos;re just buying under the need . One person at Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of jam . He &apos;s buying a jar of jam because it &apos;s more important .
So we put DryBath in these creative slices .
You put it in and you put it outside .
And the best thing is , a monthly exchange is only in five countries .
After this model was developed , we learned a lot more about the efficiency of innovation .
We even want DryBath to be there in less than a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water every time they left and we could save two houses for children in the same places , two houses , more than two hours for school , two more houses for children .
After seeing the global impact , we &apos;ve taken it for granted our key value , transparency and reward .
DryBath is an aspiring man and a life of a stranger .
The project is taking action , and now we &apos;re actually walking into a network of commercials that can fit into the retail market , and one question I have for researchers today , at Limpopo , within a week , with a 50-pound bunch of Americans to come up with a way that doesn &apos;t have to digest the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And one more important thing is that I learned a lot from this early operation , Google announced me last year as the world &apos;s earliest teenager .
Now , I am the world &apos;s greatest student of science entrepreneurs , the first African to ever come to this campaign , and one thing that amazes me , which is why everybody wouldn &apos;t want to go to the campaign . Thank you .
( Applause )
In the West , I &apos;m going to share some of these results with you today , and I &apos;m also wondering what is the real nature of the achievement of organizations — in which factors are really due to the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will get the human skills that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the invisible visible .
But , if initial organizations are the best , why do most of the failures occur ?
So I wanted to think .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know so much about this , I wanted to learn so much about my own various assumptions and false assumptions that came from organizations all the way up to me .
I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been studying the foundation of different workshops since I was 12 years old at the Hyderabad School in Hyderabad , all the way to school when I built solar power tools , then in college , when I built a laparoscope .
I graduated from college , and I founded Sputnik .
And 20 years ago , the Indus Valley started , in the last 20 years we &apos;ve started to build a lot of companies , a lot of failures , a lot of failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to address these elements for the greatest success or failure of organization .
So I looked at these five .
First , think .
I think it &apos;s something .
So I set up a company called Aideia Lib , which is the kind of place where you feel about it .
By the time I left , I thought maybe the team , the ability to look outwards or collapse , is even more critical .
I &apos;d never thought it was going to be the case for the next TED Talk , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan when I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think it &apos;s true for business .
A team has the potential to determine what to do next .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought , maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started thinking about the business model .
Does the state have any obvious need to do with income ?
With that in mind , it seemed to me that what was the most important thing for the last success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies make great investments .
Could that be the most important ?
After that , of course — is it true ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t prepared for it ?
This is the soft , meaning that you will come and learn the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or will it go so far , and I have so many mysteries before ?
So I moved from these five factors to many institutions .
And they &apos;ve gone to 100 companies in Libya , 100 companies out of 100 to try to find a scientific result .
So first of all , on these ideas , top five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Good To , NetZero , Tickets.com. — these are all dollars of revenue .
And on the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we had a lot of hope , but nothing came .
And then I tried to categorize all these characters as I think these companies had gone through .
Then in the outdoors of the iPod , I looked at weird innovations , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here are some things : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in these companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t afford it .
I tried to understand that the most important factors had to do with the success and the failure of all of these companies , and the result struck me .
The first thing was time .
The right amount is 42 percent of the time between business and failure .
Tim and Shirley are on the other end of the spectrum , and then thinking , being different , being unique , it &apos;s actually a third multiplicator .
But really , it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but it looks at it and I &apos;m amazed that the idea doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the entrepreneurial model and investment comes in my mind .
I think the business model is still very challenging because you can start with a business model , and then when you &apos;re growing a business model , include it .
And also , if investment was low , if investment was low , but now it &apos;s increasing , so especially today , investment is very easy .
I &apos;m going to give you some examples here of all these dots .
Let &apos;s take a big airbnb , as most of you know .
It turns out that a lot of investors in this company were watching because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to be a part of your house ?
Of course , it turns out to be wrong .
One of the reasons why gross is so successful is because of the best practice , the idea , the high cost , the right time .
This company was faced with problems around the time when people needed additional supply , and it certainly helped people to reject the protest in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best employees .
However , time was absolutely right to make their democracy part of it .
Dreaders wanted additional income ; it was absolutely essential .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed Wikipedia .
Goto.com , which we published here at TED in 1998 , was when companies wanted more companies to look up .
We thought it was best , but actually , the right time was probably more .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was a online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . With enough headquarters and a better frame of reference , let &apos;s work with giant technologies from Holland .
If you had broadband networks in 1999 and 2000 , it was very little .
It was so hard to watch that online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do in your browser , and eventually this company started in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of coding and crashed 50 percent in Broadband America , YouTube was the best time .
Increasingly , the best of times .
It turns out that YouTube didn &apos;t have a working example when it started .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was extremely optimistic .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is very important .
The idea is very significant .
But maybe time &apos;s choice is important .
And the best way to quantify time is to look at if there are really scarce aspects to your waste .
And the whole notion of immortality is that the outcome is not from the outcome , because if you like something , you want to keep it going , but over time you have to work very safely .
As it used to be , primary organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of those conversations will help you raise your chances of success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best allies .

&#91; On the 3rd of April 2016 we saw the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; Panama Papers wiped out hope and energy individuals &#93; &#91; growing small amounts of money in non-nations &apos; companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We brought the Roberto Paler from the Gulf Wentles Program to the state of the world . &#93; This week , the culture of storytelling has been central to
From the Panama Papers , they painted the paper from the tiny , blue shopping companies .
We have students , businesses and lawyers , who come in and tell us things like , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see Michelangelo , you can look at text messaging , you can see how they work , how they communicate .
Its effects start to appear from now on .
The prime minister of Arizona is famous .
We also have this national news that veterinary companies are sitting at night with post-docs .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of stolen goods go to the source of Russian cotton from his childhood friend , the famous Sistine .
And there &apos;s going to be a lot of exciting people , and the ones that come from those stories are going to be sitting next to the blue machines . I &apos;m going to go home .
Now , this tells a story about a magic movie , or the story of Jonathan .
What should we do with it ?
But perhaps the aggression and the power of people sitting in their pockets and not ticking as much , meaning that pharmaceutical actions like girls are undergoing health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , the Global Witness , this is amazing .
Worldwide media and political leadership are talking about how people have shared their evidence in cutting-edge societies .
I think it &apos;s a world for people to look at , and it &apos;s very difficult to think about what these companies are doing .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can go to another company , another company , another company , which is pretty much impossible to figure out who is behind this table .
For law enforcement , it &apos;s hard to think about what &apos;s happening .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that the United States has not heard so much about it .
Maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in the military .
The reason it works is because of companies , there are only a few in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we &apos;re going to go to Kenema Airlines or Dolly Viewers or Mozart or Neanderthals , those are the ones that don &apos;t belong to the United States .
But a lot of American leaders don &apos;t have to know that information , and they need little information to run for the campaign , even from the Leverage Card .
In schools in America , information like this is being read .
Nine soldiers make it easy .
We &apos;re all affected by this .
Now in the Gulf Wentles , we wanted to look at how this is happening .
How does that actually work ?
So what we did is we took a contract and we shipped it across 13 management companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation became the African minister who wanted to transport goods across America , a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The sad thing was that all the lawyers could give one demonstration of how to move their teeth .
These were all early meetings , and no lawyers were making our way , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but it was a damage to the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about the individual law that talked about our conscience and imagination .
It &apos;s not just about a politician who &apos;s been trained in school .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which protect the tickle , the sand , the debate and the disruption .
And to make that happen , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it hard to get around .
It can be subjective , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people of hope and energy are constantly falling apart .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
In the last few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the country of the company is going to speak .
This issue was launched on political issues , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Department of Defense declared at a Geighth of July in Antarctica in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is forming a central record , whether it &apos;s actually a country in Europe or whether it &apos;s controlling them .
The key thing is that the U.S. is behind it .
The contrast in terms of regulatory law patterns is different in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to go much higher , so we did the Financial .
Agriculture wants to see , the secret to big businesses , which were used around the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Gulf Watts .
You have to reach out to the grassroots and grassroots organizations behind corporations .
You know , they make a voice , it &apos;s not good for the secret sauce , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to change the legitimacy of access to information .
We can violate this secret by engaging in the secret sauce and keeping the schools open .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It says that the Lickens , which you &apos;ve invented , has made , over the last few years , more sensitive devices than any medium in the world .
Can it happen ?
Julian Sangju : Yeah , can it ?
This is a provocative — what &apos;s not ? — that the media of the world is increasingly showing that a small group of workers is increasing the amount of information that the rest of the world are doing .
CA : What does it look like ?
How do people make tools ?
And how do you maintain their secret ?
Julian Sangju : Yeah , so here they are . I can tell you — the right ideas are civilian service . And we have so many ways to get information to us .
So we use a lot of low pressure coordination to send materials to the Internet from one place to the other , to show good signals for reaching out to law enforcement policies such as software and blogging .
We get information in the form of data , whether it &apos;s code , whether it &apos;s code , whether it &apos;s social news organizations , forming it — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about delivering dumb information to people and then protecting yourself against legislative and political governments .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to try to make this confident , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Asanga : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;re always going to be alive , and if we &apos;re going to get to a room , we &apos;re going to get the skin to dispense information .
( Applause ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I guess they &apos;re so cool and they &apos;re asking what the code is — the TED Conference . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you described a few years ago .
If we could look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you thought and what happened next ?
Julian Sandage : Yeah , so this is the Colorado Report .
It was a brutal journalism written by the Chinese government over there in the aftermath of 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had moved on for 18 years .
He was a soft potter in Kenya .
And when the book was empowered — according to the volunteers trying to figure out how to replicate China , they took 20 blocks of this report card and put it on the report card and on one more report .
And then the government looked at it and used it as a contrary to its political video , which was the most hopeful person — now the most hopeful person in China .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
So China was elected in 2007 , and we were able to account for the very first election of the election before December 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided , three days later , Kobe decided to make friends with the person who was terrified by Daniel Arp so that he could download the report and put it in a box of candy .
CA : And — so , I mean , just briefly , it &apos;s — it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by commercial reasoning , but by the way , and by you , it &apos;s transformed the result of selection .
Julian Sangju : Yes . This is the headline of Guardian , and then it was distributed across the entire country of China , Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , a few days later , trusted the Chinese public to talk about it .
And this blog was placed on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the weather , according to an online gender editor , and it changed the result of the first decision .
CA : Oh , so how did you actually change the world ?
Julian Sandy : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re just showing a little demo of a little demo of a little side effect .
This is a bit of a video , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart failure .
RD : It &apos;s hot . It &apos;s hot when you first send them two .
I thought , oh , there are four with them .
It &apos;s actually clear . It &apos;s okay now . Glass is cool .
When I &apos;m standing in front of you , tell me — go ahead .
Take everybody .
Hold on , hold on !
( Mechanical noises ) Gold running . Gold running . ( Mechanical noises ) Gold running .
Hotel . He &apos;s two , he &apos;s two .
We have to stop now , time is coming .
Okay , now we &apos;ve got eight people in our hands .
Here we &apos;re looking at two birds , and we &apos;re still growing plants .
Roger . They &apos;re on my show .
Two things , two things , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what &apos;s going on ? What was happening ?
God bless you , bless you .
CA : So what did it do ?
Julian Sung : The people who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We ended up doing more research with two people .
It was the first of three spheres to be true .
CA : So 11 people in the attack had dropped , just two full weeks ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two weeks of Royers , two small children were injured .
Twenty-six out of 18 were wiped out .
CA : And after his execution , he had so much fun .
What was the underlying reason for that ?
Julian Asanga : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as the ultimate inequality of power .
On the one hand , some people in the garden , and then a kilometer away , Hilly Catter begins to grow 30 kilometers away from the crop — anyone in many — and gives birth to children .
They also had two priests who weren &apos;t wealthy because they were priced .
CA : Well , the U.S. intelligence agency had a brilliant mining in it , and it said that he had acknowledged that video had made you an homework assignment of 280,000 and a half American devices .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sangju : So we decided to accept the device .
It turns out that five days ago , 150,000 installations were made and 50 .
But we &apos;ve now done what we did at the beginning of the year , a proxy for a U.S. subsidiary , but no correlation .
I mean , I grew up in the house most of the time .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of other devices in the U.S.
Julian Assange : We &apos;re doing it . ( CA : Y &apos;all going to do it ? ) Julian Assange : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Assange : Because this kind of thing shows you that actually , right now , what the Arab states are doing , these states are actually violating human rights .
If you look at the purple objects , the material is in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
What do I mean by your philosophy generally ?
Why would you want to know the information ?
Julian Assange : So the question is how important information in the world are , how information can be transformed .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you want to get information out of it , because the institutions know it better , and they know their stories , they also care about it .
And we &apos;re in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But are those risks individually or collectively leveraged societies , where you don &apos;t expect them to come from thinking ?
Julian Sangju : We didn &apos;t do what the equipment was with them .
I mean , our big impact is real .
With information , we can extract information in a specific way that &apos;s intuitive — the information that &apos;s available to someone .
But there are also some mysteries — you have your doctor &apos;s data ; it &apos;s a mystery — but we &apos;re talking about these civic services that come in and out of nowhere .
CA : OK , so they &apos;re doing it with a lot of excitement .
And what you &apos;re going to do about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is applied to the American phrase , and she says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve found something so powerful that some people like to hug others .
It shows an American footprint on dead people .
Which works — but he has shown millions of people around the world who are American science fiction .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , what are you going to say ? What are you going to answer ?
Julian Sangju : We &apos;re asking a lot of questions like this .
But remember , in Iraq , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t need to watch a video , so they &apos;re looking at it .
It doesn &apos;t matter what they think , it doesn &apos;t matter what they perceive .
Because that &apos;s how they all look .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and mindsets that fund this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re thinking of hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to think that in order to make this light , you have to have a secret to your own mind ?
Julian Sandage : Not exactly . I mean , we don &apos;t have any different fantasies .
We have no idea what other minds are .
If they do that , it &apos;s very difficult for us to do that , but we &apos;re doing something like this where people are ethically inclined to feel that it &apos;s going to grow tomorrow .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , what we &apos;ve done is — let &apos;s talk about it with the blind .
You can also see that there are different ideas about the law and the law .
One is about people who make hope .
Or you can find problems .
What &apos;s the point of view ?
And what about problems ?
Julian Sangju : Oh ! Something should be .
CA : That &apos;s a lot of great people . That &apos;s great .
We have to try and — the waters are showing another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Now , this is a very interesting story , which is small , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Song : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — we found a lot of important secrets in the bank in November , as in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a national report — which happened to be a very good analysis of this — where I was told that actually , the conservation companies were going to counter all the different types of companies , and they were going to sit there and watch them .
And there were some bananas governments . No .
And there was nothing at the top of the report . So this was a very difficult thing for us .
We didn &apos;t believe him because he didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we were wondering , perhaps this company has done all of these opposite games .
We put it on the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t really know , but what can we do ?
This stuff is so good , and I look it up right , but we can &apos;t fix it . &quot; &quot; And so we got a letter from the guy who wrote it , and he wanted to put the tool in . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to fix the device . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re going to talk about it .
What are the tools that you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you show the money that you have legally owned by it ?
Is this real you ? &quot; &quot; And they brought us what we think of as the mirror with the name of the text with the microwave LED .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s one way of thinking about what materials are , and it &apos;s trying to write and achieve from people .
CA : All right . So , any information out there ?
Julian Sangju : Yeah , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re collecting multiple and repairing actions as difficult as possible .
So our description of poetry has been increasingly difficult in a few months , because we &apos;re improving our buck system because of the rare waste that we have .
This is Princess .
I mean , like any kind of system that &apos;s going on , more of our capability is starting to stumble upon us because of our growth , and what that means is that we have a lot of civic services as well as intellectual services , but we don &apos;t have very many people who can regulate and update this information .
CA : So that &apos;s basically the problem , how many primarily do you want a conservative entrepreneur or a conservative ?
Julian Sangju : Yeah . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we have a system where it &apos;s very difficult to cope with the material that we have with the body , so we have to reconfigure it so that we can get people to work with very sensitive , very sensitive , very sensitive , very carefully .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think where I learned that when I was a kid , you went to 37 different schools .
Is that correct ?
Julian Asanga : Yes , my parents were in the movies business of movies and then moving away from the sun , so the two existence influences ...
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : What I mean by a psychologist is that everything can be done can be subjective .
Julie Song : What , the movie theater ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one guy at a young age , and you were kind of on the verge of adoption .
Julian Sangju : Yeah , so I was an actor .
You know , I was a very young entrepreneur .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time who helped me deal with this crime .
So you need to use the word to match the word .
I mean — there &apos;s one way that you can use different things .
Unfortunately , at the time , it &apos;s only Russian mammoth that &apos;s using your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
So this word , it doesn &apos;t really matter what it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re running a bank account of your grandmother , but do you think of your core values ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and maybe something about their life that helped them survive ?
Julian Song : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : well , people don &apos;t get influenced ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the light that I &apos;ve learned from my father and some of the other vulnerable and difficult people that live in my life .
CA : Can people not have the tough ones and the tough ones ?
Julian Asanga : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a junior man , so I &apos;m not very good at agriculture , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of raising influencers , which is to make money close to criminal .
And that &apos;s what exists in my career in many ways .
CA : So for the last few years , we &apos;ve been just wondering : What happened in Asia ?
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , somebody has a problem with the bank , and then they &apos;ve made the news strongly avoided the narrative of the deception .
Instead , they blamed your status .
That makes you famous enough in the West Bank . So what happened ?
Julian Sangju : Yeah , it &apos;s a huge fact . You know .
The East Linda had a crisis .
There was the strongest of them .
The Big Bang was already growing under the GDP of the rest of the country .
No , we did that report last July .
And the state of the art property that happened five minutes before the publication of it , like a movie : &quot; The violent property of the News Institute , and the state of the New Reader was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming all the time , and we became very popular in the Ice Line , and I went to East Linda and talked about it .
And there were the elements of the people there who shouldn &apos;t be again , and as a result , the Asian leaders in the audience , were working with some other international Masters , and we lobbied for an Asian Linda Law called for an Asian Linda Law , so this was a kind of free medium , because the cyclists around the world were making the most protective place , the new Nepal
A North American country is like the light , which means it &apos;s moving upwards from low to low .
And a month ago , the Alliance Party delivered it explicitly .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look into the future , do you think there &apos;s more hope to express power and energy , greater security , or are we going to see all of that power , or are they going to hit all of that ?
Julian Sangju : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure to agree with the law of liberty and the law of transparency , the First World — in Europe , between China and the United States .
What is this going to be like ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very exciting time to live in — because with a little effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the name of Samuel , Julian , into perspective , and all your power .
Julian Sandage : Thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching both .
So I did that , which is the hunt of milk .
I &apos;d run through my childhood connectome , and I would watch these videos of consolation .
When I grew up in college and went back home in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team was a college student .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , I realized how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And wherever I went to places I would suspect that North Carolina , Pursat , or in London , I would see the snow packed with four creatures — okay , dark , silver and codes .
And I thought this was a big strange thing , and I wondered if anyone else would ever play the drill .
And when I looked at it , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at these connective teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Powerful giving the world a few elements is not an unusual human trait .
This is what we did 10,000 years ago when we analyzed our caves .
If you look at the oil spills 10,000 years ago , they look like wildfire and brilliant creatures .
But if you go back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals , cow , liver and cook .
It &apos;s also true of birds .
You &apos;re looking at New York City &apos;s workshop about 150 or 200 years ago , and you &apos;re looking at it like a doctor , a battery and a south .
But if you look around the outside , you &apos;re only going to see four birds — three , four , five , five .
It seems to me that we &apos;re getting bigger here .
How did that happen to us ?
Shire .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
So in the last 50 years we &apos;ve been doing this kind of thing .
The second great war has given us tremendous excitement to be here .
During the Great War , we launched the technology , such as the Sun , the Polymer , and all of these things were happening .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see increasingly the potential of catastrophe .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that there &apos;s been an increase in well-being and social agriculture , and for the last two years it &apos;s been increasing in total quantity .
Now if you collect the forest army and the forest army , it will reach between two Chinese and two Chinese each year .
My Chinese counterparts are not the same thing , because China is not just one of the biggest takers , but also one of the biggest benefits .
So now let &apos;s turn to our framework .
First , the United States and the West have the most expensive salary of food .
The jungle is an extreme event .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest to get to market .
Language is an incredible way to get to the market .
In a study done in a clinical trial in Delhi , it turns out that gasoline sequesters are extremely ineffective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where there are forests in the forests , there are forests in Minnesota .
Now look at the blood vessels .
It tracks the metal of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protects its area , protects the beach , cool and cool kids , find all the important things for the atmosphere .
Some of this has happened with the forests of Michigan .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of islands on the coast .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the rope right now , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now , there are all kinds of things that are going on that are going to disappear from the big nerve , but with it , with very large numbers of ants , they &apos;re going to disappear and they &apos;re going to change from cooking to cooking .
And a lot of the time , there &apos;s a lot of work going on in these places called &quot; &quot; Reddit . &quot; &quot; This is the kind of thing that we would like to look at on the river , which means changing it in fresh food , which means that the environmental system is playing itself and making it cool .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the United States and the West .
Tonya is a solid global puzzle .
You have to send a very large area to organize it in such a way .
We have our own interest in what scientists call &quot; &quot; microfinance archive &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; ICCAT . &quot; &quot; Entertainment Committee for Protecting ATLM .
Carl Whale also put together a great reunion for all of the tuna .
We can run tuna , but tuna doesn &apos;t have good tuna .
Not many people know , but too many people do .
He can run 40 miles an hour , and he can drive more than 20 dollars of warming around his environment .
So all of the videos on the left are pretty much done .
Frustrated pneumonia is a blood vessel that no longer flows .
It &apos;s the best protein .
But the forest creature , 40 miles away , does not have to stay in the forest .
Samantha &apos;s good luck . It doesn &apos;t have to be a monthly conspiracy .
This is my direct connectome .
Connecticut left the forest floor .
If you look at the maps of the connectome , each dot has a dot .
In management of the connectome there are 3,000 of them .
So I &apos;m saying that more people in the connectome — ( Laughter ) if anyone is playing the power of the connectome , I think we can make the world a lot better .
And everywhere , these are rockets that go right through the first place to give children to Samantha .
As a result , we walked up to the emergency room and we had a successor at Samman Farming .
When Samantha Fermi started , there were six pounds of forest cattle to build a fund .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
There &apos;s one left at the other end of the spectrum , because if you look at Freeman &apos;s Facebook , they &apos;re called the Summan Pond in a decade of Facebook .
Whereas this database consists of interest .
It &apos;s hard to say something about Michelangelo and Malala .
But even then , the critical industry is pushing forward to establishing the criteria for replacing the bottom half of the pyramid .
It &apos;s a system by which the Ecuadorian is floating on the Earth .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the years .
If we &apos;re going to reach the market for a second , we &apos;re going to have quite a bit of money , but we &apos;re also going to have a lot of money .
We don &apos;t just play chickens , we play chickens and chickens .
We have what &apos;s left and what &apos;s left and what &apos;s left .
Because on the left , the blood and the lungs are painted and the lungs are painted .
I wonder if there &apos;s anything wrong with that , and that chicken has died .
India is already beginning to die . ( Laughter ) So this is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking all over the world about 30 million tons of forest creatures produced by salamanders using them .
It &apos;s equal to the third part of China or the number of people in the United States who come out of Summer every year .
The last thing is in four .
The photosynthesis actually started as lions .
And it started with a local manufacturer who saw that the next day , no one would ever be on the Mike Dodgers .
He went to Rick and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a fundraiser for you . &quot;
Look at the left .
It was a document that Ebola did not stop .
So he made his own liposuction syndrome .
Syndressed into 30 centimeters .
He wanted to make it in 25 seconds , so he brought in the Atlantic Code .
The total photosynthetic pollution facility is the largest mass-market clean industry in America , moving from two to three billion pounds a year of clean drinking water .
If we just finish the money , the alternative option might be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plankton from the animal protein in a very efficient way , and that &apos;s me for the third world .
Actually , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; in nine months it &apos;s growing from an individual .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s going on .
There &apos;s no I.Q. whatsoever that we think it will save us all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this strange little clip .
This represents a large sample of three million tons .
One possibility that conservation guards have wondered is , can we play it ?
Can we play it safe instead of giving it to society ?
There are reasons for that .
They &apos;re going to have a happy childhood to go to the market , where the typical part of the lottery is the typical part of the lottery and the performance of the Indus script is the top one .
This is OMG 3 , EPA and DIY .
So this is his ability .
But what if instead of giving us a few dollars a pound or a foot or a foot , we turned it into a foot , and we turned it into a corner , and we said , &quot; &quot; Could we really pay for the maggots to give the other money ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that the home is particularly important .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
Its calculation is extremely effective .
The ratio of meat to meat is only partial to the market .
Actually , it comes out of three walls .
Summerwear creates three vertical axis , so they just come together .
If you think about the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algae , the reason we use fracture and nitrogen is because of the way we use fracture .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 people have been born , and these are the leading causes of death in Somalia .
As you can think about clicks , there are more proteins and there are three more effective things in all of these different disciplines .
It &apos;s just like that .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can create a condition that can prove to us that safe protein is useful .
It has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be green , it has to be DHA OMG3 , it has to be FIT .
This is already underway in the paper .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can all do this .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , then the third component of the world &apos;s monthly epidemic , which is almost 30 million tons , will be in Shanghai .
I mean , it &apos;s all going on .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I had a big brain to study because I have a brother who is a mental illness , schizophrenia .
More or less , I wanted to think in an organization , how do I connect my dreams from my reality and make my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they disrupt their dreams in public and in shared reality , and they do it .
So I dedicated my life to searching for intense mental illness .
And I moved from my office to Indonesia to Boston , where I worked at the head of Dr. Frankenstein Bank , who was a professor at Harvard University .
So what was the difference in the brains of people who were trying to generally visualize themselves as opposed to the brains of people who were in schizophrenia , schizophrenia , or B.C. , is that , in fact , we were trying to create the micro-controllers of the brain , which cells are sending messages to the cell with the chemical and the quantity of the cell ?
So there was a lot of privilege in my life because I was doing research on this part of the day , but at night and weekend , I was visiting a lawyer in the NAMI .
But on the morning of December 10 , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intellectual disaster .
The back of my brain was a nine strokes .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain contract perfectly with any ability to understand information .
By the morning of college , I was able to read and write and learn something .
I was a newborn baby in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a similar brain , there are two parts of it that are completely separate from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the brain &apos;s first part of the brain , touching the left part of the brain , and so this will lead to me .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain , completely separate from each other .
For those of you who think that the computer is working like an old-fashioned prosthetic device on the left of our brain , the left part of our brain is like a serial prosthetic .
These two pieces also fear messages within the cross-section of the cross-section of the cross-section that some 300 volunteers have taken .
But they &apos;re also perfectly fine .
Because they think information in a different way is to think about information in a very different way , their facial expressions are different than the other one .
Thank you very much .
Teacher : Go ahead .
( Laughter ) Our brains are just beginning to think about this moment .
Right now , our brains are thinking about images in our brains that are literally thought about the motions of our bodies .
Information is stored in the form of information that is stored in our bodies and amplified throughout our entire nervous system , and then it &apos;s distributed to form a giant online class that tells us what existing space is and what it is to understand and what it is to understand .
I am an energy imprisoned by the power of my surroundings through the lower left of the brain .
We &apos;re empowered individuals who are separated from each other through the perception of the left part of the brain in a human family .
And at this point , we are brothers from this planet who are making the world a better place .
And at this point , we are the best and the best .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
Our brain right here is scientifically and militarily thinking .
The rest of our brain is about material and the future .
To the left of the brain is to say that we need to take the biggest icon of ours right now and start collecting them and then collecting them .
And it also brings together this kind of information that is organized and integrated into the material , all of the things that we &apos;ve learned since and all of the possibilities of the future , namely , will determine its impact on our symbols .
Our brain right here is thinking in language .
It &apos;s a conversation about what makes us and our inner world bigger than the outside world .
It &apos;s a tiny little voice that tells me how to go home and buy and remember .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a sense of pursuing my book that reminds me that I &apos;m a storyteller .
But perhaps the most important voice is what he says , I am ! I am !
And as my brain says here , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I am divided .
I &apos;m becoming a single embodied person with great power around me and with you .
And one part of my brain that happened this morning was filled with a college attack .
On the morning of the college attack , my left eye on the back with a broken nose .
It was as painful as the sight of the Soviet Union .
And that pain drove me like I did and left .
And then he leaves , and then he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary that I never had any pain whatsoever , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing I can do with my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I looked at my cartoon and I looked at my master &apos;s degree machine .
Now I &apos;m moving forward to this mechanism because it feels like my eye is the fifth of a primitive human being that spans the dodo .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m doing something bizarre and bizarre . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like my perception shifted , which is the general sense of truth in which I have a man who is walking through this experience , but I &apos;ve now gone through a mysterious and mysterious place where
And it was all strange and weird and my head was growing .
So I moved out of the machine , and I started screaming in the room , and I felt like everything was going on inside my body .
And everything is very difficult and very thinkable .
I have nothing to do with my behavior , and I think there &apos;s a housing issue , so it &apos;s only within the inner system .
I &apos;m sitting in my own house watching the arm go down , and I &apos;m actually speaking inside my body .
I heard a song that said , &quot; &quot; Oh my father must sing you now .
My father , you run away , and then I &apos;m not balancing , I &apos;m stroking the wall .
I &apos;m lying and looking at my hand , and I realize I can &apos;t fix my body now .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand and my hand are atom and the magnetic wall .
If I understood anything , it was power —
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in the back of my brain , Chaz was completely silent .
That &apos;s how someone sounded TVs on the RMTVs .
One final tail .
First , I had an astonishment by the end of my brain .
But then immediately , like in another link , the energy came into this huge spacecraft that was all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
And then one of the first things that happened in my brain was the part of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a problem . &quot;
So we need to help somebody , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really removed from any problem — ( Laughter ) — it seemed like I was really removed from the problem , but I quickly came back to the same sentence that I told you so much .
But he was so beautiful .
Imagine that it &apos;s a beautiful place where you &apos;re completely dependent on this tiny brain that &apos;s keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my drink and I &apos;m getting pushed about it .
I was feeling a lot of joy in my body .
And look at all of your relationships that come from the outside world and from that point of view had gone missing .
And I felt a safe space .
And think about what it would look like if you lost your fingernails in this 70-year-old sensitive weight that you had left .
( Laughter ) So I started as a mystery .
It was beautiful .
So my brain went in and he said , &quot; &quot; Holy cow !
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I need to help with this , so I &apos;m pouring necklace from home and I &apos;m wearing mechanisms right now on my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I go to work ? &quot; &quot; And this moment , my hands completely dissolved .
It occurred to me that my God was attacking me from college , the one thing my mind tells me is , how cool is it ?
( Laughter ) Something fake !
There will be some brain researchers who will come to me in the moment to realize that they can counsel their own brain and that they can — ( Laughter ) — and then one mouse in my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go to college . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t fix the college campaign , but I &apos;ll get back to my normal in a couple of weeks . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job , so remember I had my budget card , which is my phone number .
So I go into my study room and I create a three-inch heel of motion cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card as I can see from my naked eye what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , because I don &apos;t see any points of view .
And the words are going to be helped by the maps of the paper and the markers , and I wasn &apos;t doing anything .
So I started expecting what I call posture .
And at this point , the public repeated the truth again and I realized that it wasn &apos;t a card . It wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to decrease the code just a minute .
And the impact of the entire camp in 45 minutes was just getting higher .
I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any truth .
So I take the phone and I put it there .
I took the blue card and I put it there and now I &apos;m looking at the cards and I &apos;m looking at the big guys on the phone with the shapes of the cards .
But then I would leave my lower jail when I was coming back , not reminding me that I had made it to the prime minister .
So I took my college campus like a Donna and stuck them on the sides and twisted them so that when I got back to the public truth , I can tell you that I was going to be laughing until I finally came home from all of them , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh wow , wow , wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So
So I say to her , &quot; I &apos;m speaking clearly in my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like , &quot; &quot; Woo hoo , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he brought me to the father I didn &apos;t know that I could speak any language at the time , and I didn &apos;t realize I couldn &apos;t speak a word until I tried it .
So she realized that I needed help and she brought help .
And the next day , I was in an ambulance driving from one Hospital to another Hospital in Boston .
I could go down and look like a baby boy .
Just like the one cloud remained the same and was completely exhausted from above , I pulled the power out and felt my soul holding it .
And that moment made me realize that I was not allowed to live now .
Or the doctor would save me and give me a second life or give me a second life .
By the time I left , I was surprised enough that I was alive .
When I felt my soul shattered , I said goodbye to life .
Now my brain was distorted by two facts .
At that time , my emotional system started to move in the face of pain .
The light switched off my brain like a forest , and the water was so violent that I couldn &apos;t hear a song or sing a song , and I was just blowing away .
Because I could not recognize my body &apos;s fragmentation , so I felt enormous and enormous and widespread like the one that was free of my own .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant , well-intentioned well-intentioned well-intentioned , in the end .
It &apos;s a massive / Nirvana .
I had the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible for me to finish my own gigantic identity and to learn from the inside of a small body .
But then I felt like , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive . &quot;
I &apos;m alive now , and I &apos;ve got nerves .
And if I &apos;m nervous enough , and I &apos;m alive now so that whatever life is , he can get nerves , and I &apos;ve seen a world like this that &apos;s fueled by people with beauty , preserve , compassion and love , who know that they can ever feel this quality .
And they can pick up and choose , and the right thing is that the books want to step on the back of their brain in order to try to understand this pure quality .
And then I realized how wonderful this experiment could be , &quot; &quot; What a lesson of vision that taught me to live my life .
And he gave me the courage to be healthy .
After the earthquake of the cold , the southern hemisphere triggered a blood vessel from my brain that was investigated in the temporal lobe of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So where are we ?
We are the power of synthetic life , with machine learning and two extremely exciting brains .
And we have the power to choose where we are and what we want to be in the world .
That &apos;s where I can walk to the left side of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful mammalian cells are found in one form , one in which everybody exists .
Or I can choose to walk around the corner of my consciousness where I become an individual , &quot; in a tiny way .
Go ahead of your time .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My parents are us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And who ?
I think as long as we spend our left-right brain scanning electrical impulses , we &apos;re going to emit security in this world and our planet is going to be safe .
And I thought , you know , you need to have this idea .
Thank you .

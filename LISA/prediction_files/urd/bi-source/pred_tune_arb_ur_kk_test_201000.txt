Good morning !
Are you ready ?
They took my name to the stage , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No ! Anybody ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , just a few years ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and I was projecting food .
So I asked , did you have a fishing list in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Syria ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In the Islamic Renaissance , in the Islamic Renaissance . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; Did the French word be right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; The girl said .
He was speaking to me as someone once said to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy , a typewriter , made two words , and a girl was very quiet and very quiet .
How does he speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s stopping me from giving up on my own country ?
Where could that be ?
How did we get there ?
Now while we &apos;re here , there are many people like me who get to the stage in their lives where they routinely leave out everything that &apos;s going on in their minds , just because they love to say , and they &apos;re depressed .
Do I want to drive my whole culture , my ideas , my spirit and my spirit ?
Could we have the most important battle stories of children ?
Do they want to give me what I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
What would that mean ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I wouldn &apos;t want to make this compassionate decision about what it was for me .
The Arabic language does not ask the demands of today .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or it &apos;s a language that we &apos;re using in universities , a language that we use everywhere in the workspace we look at when we work on a project for advanced inquiry , and it &apos;s certainly not a language that we prepare for the Higgs field .
If we do that , they will cover up to us .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s a second more important fact that we should think about .
Arabic is a language .
The research shows that you need to improve the way you teach fractions to other languages .
In other languages , the emergence of language is the main building block .
How ?
The Victorians , when he first started writing , exploited Arabic .
The whole idea , the imagination and the philanthropy of this young boy was in that village where he grew up , felt special , felt a special voice , and thought about a special idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their English texts , you felt so happy , you felt the same sense .
You can imagine that these are also in English the same texts as this little boy who was standing in a trench all over the city of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to stop the tongue .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China all have this in common .
That &apos;s why they develop laws to protect their tongue .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in resources , they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Did we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this developed mindset is still missing , and we want to move to the developed world .
The countries that looked like us at the same time , but decided to try to make progress , research and reach those countries , such as Taiwan , analytics and so forth , they tackled their language to the way that they read the students , as they did .
They kept it close to each other .
Because if you take Turkey or Wheel factories and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in unknown consumers , as we do most of the time .
So to create new inventions and new facilities , they needed to ensure their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Iraq , autism , liberty , &quot; &quot; what does that tell you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Languages contain patterns of our lives , and words that are connected to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Art , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special circuit in your brains . Each of you has special feelings for a given day in a unique history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an insider that really has to do with what we think , and how we look at each other and how we view each other .
What is our minds ?
How would you figure it out ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereign , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the age of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , well better yet , I go and spend a lot of time talking about beer .
It &apos;s just that the expression reminds us of a special thing .
A French speaker friend of mine sent me a message from a French .
I was asking her one more time .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s all well , but once , I tried to meet her husband and translate it one night to what it means to be prevented . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Women typically called it &quot; &quot; anemia , &quot; &quot; and then all night try to understand it .
He wondered , how could this be so obvious ?
Do they want to self-organize ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Two-tone singing ) This is one of the few examples .
It made us realize that he didn &apos;t really understand the word for his husband , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought about it was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me FedEx , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I feel when I hear FedEx . &quot; &quot; The woman was trying to translate that , &quot; &quot; I have raised my hand and you &apos;ve taken it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And SM : And because you &apos;re me , I just raised my hand and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
He translates . He gives me a shot .
( Applause ) So , what did we do for a big Arabic language ?
We changed it for a society , and we started an Arab language campaign .
After many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Please don &apos;t blame the wind . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protection campaign heard a phrase , which is , &quot; I talk to you east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t understand this way , because in this way , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if someone says to me , I hate Arabic .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in a way that can impact our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
It &apos;s a letter that looks like us and the way we think .
So this sentence says , &quot; &quot; I speak to you in the East , but you answer the West . &quot; &quot; The right sign is yes .
Simple but effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters .
You see , out there , you see an example , in a context with the letter black and blue on the screen , which says , &quot; Don &apos;t kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We really should not kill our language .
If we destroy our language , we have to become a knowledge of ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to go back to the beginning .
And that hurts so much with the opportunity to create modernity and religion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
Cole models of boys and girls .
We are very coal !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve taken an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; Coca-Cola . &quot; &quot; They want to make as much comfort as I want to make , but I &apos;ve got to make the word good out of it and that &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money , we don &apos;t need to manipulate ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to create an argument that we will not let anyone make room at all , or that we don &apos;t realize that language has a high status , putting pressure on us , or placing our own patients and thinking on us .
Our idea has to be creative .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the cell or not refine the rocket , we can still be creative .
At the moment , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create a native language .
Let &apos;s start with today .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Once upon a time , we can reach the world .
He can re-inflate the English alphabet before he does .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , part of the solution .
Honestly , what can you do today ?
Which one of you are Twittering ?
In Arabic , I react to you , even though my time is gone , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic script doesn &apos;t write Arabic .
( Applause ) It &apos;s dead ! It &apos;s no language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a linguistic language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more work .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to one another .
We &apos;re here to facilitate the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , does his father through language .
When my daughter is born , I can &apos;t tell her , &quot; &quot; It is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; ( This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I recruited my daughter from the light of the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) You just get this culture of shopping . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that we remember the deepest mysterious thing that we have in our presence , I was just one of the mothers who is defiling my people even though you didn &apos;t look at my generation and you didn &apos;t feel like a failure , you know , our generation has not been very good at leading to our generation when they &apos;re not popular with criticisms , and we &apos;ve
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , I had my primary career as an activist , which meant I had to write massive document .
Now an average person when they write something , that &apos;s the way they look .
You know , you &apos;re â€” ( Laughter ) You might be doing it less quickly , but in the first week , you do more work and more work , after all , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And that &apos;s what I want to do .
That &apos;s my approach .
I &apos;ll get ready for everything , but actually I &apos;ll get ready for the career , and then I &apos;ll do something like that .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens to every writing system .
And then came up with a whole new paper , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal behavior wasn &apos;t immediately committed to doing this .
It was a huge task .
I plan , and I decided I would do something like this .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m going to start off small , in the middle of the month , I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a teacher .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ?
He comes in and he goes , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a really cool project .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then the river would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were just there .
And two months were changed in a month , two weeks had changed .
And then I went out for a day and I spent three days in the audience , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote down 90 pages , two streets , and what I did was â€” people shouldn &apos;t go on two streets â€” people were tying two streets , two streets of the room , and they were constantly spending time , and I went on
I thought , this is it .
A week later , I get a call and she &apos;s from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Would you be Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you about your argument . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , from now on , that &apos;s the best . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t quite sure . ( Laughter )
He was a huge believer . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I am blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the web .
The way I do this is I get a lot of people to listen to me and I want to tell the six people what &apos;s going on in the brain and why we are .
Now , I had this hypothesis that the brain makes a difference between the six people .
So to find out , I took a leaf where I studied two brain scans , such as the brain of the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but consider it .
So here &apos;s the brain of a large human being .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
There &apos;s a decade ahead of both of the brain &apos;s decisions , but the stereotypical brain is a lot of fun .
Now , in terms of a test , what does that mean ?
It means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is a good time for job completion . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &#93; The intelligent decision would make a decision to make a point , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he tells the guys , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Tennis and Twain , because I know it &apos;s happened right now .
( Laughter ) Then â€” ( Laughter ) Then we go to the next level , and you &apos;ll see , in 10 minutes , something new emerged ?
After that , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , beginning with the conversation about the theme of the World Fund , and much later on , you &apos;re going to end up watching TV videos of Twitter &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) It would take a little time for all of those things , so it wouldn &apos;t take much longer to do something with today .
What a contract ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the foundation of happiness that you want to congratulate .
It just wants to be in the present .
It understands the unimagined future , and it &apos;s only about two things : compassion and mercy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all well .
If you can and you spend your whole life going forward , you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And to make this , there &apos;s a generation of animals .
Great food , good thought , and more generation , in the long run , that &apos;s probably what happens .
But if you didn &apos;t pay attention , now it &apos;s not too far off .
We are a growing civilization , and we don &apos;t even know it .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain that &apos;s deciding , a smart person , that &apos;s able to do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are blowing away .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is share what we enjoy .
Sometimes it seems like it &apos;s true that what they do is easily and enjoy the way they eat , sleep or enjoy the moment of opportunity .
That &apos;s why we have an image .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems counterintuitive to do what &apos;s hard to do .
And this is the climate agreement .
And for the listeners , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends a lot of time in the classroom , a simple and thriving way that &apos;s out of the classroom .
I call it a special place .
( Laughter ) Dark field is a place that people are so familiar with .
There &apos;s a time when distraction doesn &apos;t have to be a leader .
In the Dark Ages , the one that tells you is not really worth it , because it &apos;s not your right , it &apos;s a sense of wonder , a sense of awareness , an emotion of enjoyment , and it &apos;s all the properties of what &apos;s really going on .
The question is , in this case , when the principal is running the battle , how do the rest of us handle the cylinder , which is unfortunately but crucial ?
It turns out that systems also have a healthy gift to protect , which is preserved all the time in the right times â€” anyone called home .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s a homeless shelter that &apos;s most popular , but when it &apos;s closer to the data online , it becomes entertaining , or at the time when people are threatened with embarrassment , lack of employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that the outside is just given .
Now , this has been an integral part of my life , because six months ago , people at TED called me and they called me a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) I obviously did .
My wish was to come to TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my joy and mistakes , something in the brain that was deciding whether or not I was depressed .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We have to start working on it now . The principal said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India down to over 20,000 feet , we &apos;ll just breathe when we don &apos;t see all of India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
After six months , after two and a half months , people at TED decided to celebrate their name .
I broke the web and there was a photograph of me holding it .
Who cared ?
( Laughter ) Household control , and in a few seconds , the entire system was in denial . ( Laughter )
And remember in the window â€” he &apos;s scared of the house â€” he &apos;s walking down the tree !
Finally , and finally , a long-term decision maker picked up a call and can start talking .
Now , the homeowner who talks about all types of crazy , crazy , like me , how someone like me would spend two weeks trying this out and start writing , don &apos;t cry , and then incredibly successful tools that go out all night long and write .
And it &apos;s acquired three steps of clarity â€” what &apos;s called the system of steroids .
That &apos;s very good , so the lightbulbs don &apos;t work .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
When I wrote this , I surprised myself about the impact on this .
I &apos;ve actually received thousands of miles from around the world and from people , from different types of angles .
They had engineers , bankers , engineers , investors and big CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them said the same thing and wrote : &quot; I &apos;m also in conflict . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the follower of email and the birthday of email .
These people &apos;s scripts contain imagery that wrote about how much SOLEs did in their lives , in terms of what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system &apos;s right , what &apos;s the next ?
Why are all of these people in the U.S.
Well , it turns out that there are two categories of the list .
So today I give you some examples , talking about things , all of them being data online .
And when the data is online , recently , the effects of this are cruel because household is reaching .
But there &apos;s a second kind of right-hand side to the system , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data .
So if you want a project that starts with you as an arts or a business â€” something as arts or businesses , as long as you don &apos;t start paying attention to the car to do things .
Also in the businesses , there are so many things that don &apos;t go along with the DOLEs , things like getting in your family , sporting , thinking about your health , reaching out to relationships that you need to have good relationships that you can &apos;t anticipate .
Now if the only way you can do a server &apos;s job is to have a staff , it &apos;s hard , because all of the data that you have on the device is gone .
There &apos;s nothing to do . The upshot is that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it has a kind of long tradition of writing that is very little to look at and talks about much less than the available myopic , consistent primary attributes .
You &apos;re suffering from noise and rehabilitation .
And it can be a long-term threat and return .
So I thought that was the reason they emailed it , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the winter .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban Theory has survived them , sometimes in their lives .
The upside is not that they cannot dream their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and it said one thing : I think there &apos;s no sixth-person thing .
I think all of you are a soldier .
You may not have a very complex situation . Some of us â€” ( Applause ) and some of you may have good relationships with the Dutch web , but keep in mind when there &apos;s no digital light .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the career path .
Each block means a week , it &apos;s a nine-year environment .
These are not very many blocks , particularly when some of them are reciprocal .
I think we all need to go beyond that .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing well , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to stand out from the doorway .
It is for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that many houses there , but maybe we should start to do it .
Perhaps not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
That day , a package of eight days of U.S. and Afghanistan were leaving an area of Afghanistan , leaving a neighborhood of Afghanistan , and helping an office to secure the Afghan National Organization to help them protect an Afghanistan &apos;s work , helping them secure a funded foundation to protect an Afghanistan from a foreign occupation , and some of the parks had to fight of the
The military doctor arrived at the headquarters of an assault , and they were surrounded by three men and with so many things , he watched as a child by the time of the captain of the captain , and he watched as a child by the time he saved the chickens and excluded the relatives .
One of the people who got to know her children was a Scarlett , and she , with a Spanish curriculum , was heading towards the head of the hospital , and she , with a Spanish curriculum , was heading towards the hospital .
This shows you that the captain of Switzerland and his wandering through this terrible geek that he &apos;s burning during the Gulf .
They put it into the Hole in the Wall computers , and then you see the Caps Lock Expensive and you pay it off before they can save others .
I looked at it and asked myself , where did people come from ?
What is this ? These are the most emotional emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why it &apos;s the way I work with people that I &apos;m not .
You know , you go to the Gulf to lobby for people who are yearning to experience herself in order to help others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are yearning to experience others in ways that make us better .
We have an online count !
So I asked myself , where did people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just the best people .
That &apos;s why they lead to the fire .
Those who are better off is the imagery of mercy . Those who are better off is the imagery of mercy .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have the Dark Ages , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , then each and every one of us has the potential to work together and make it larger and have the potential to do that for others .
I &apos;ve had some brilliant privilege that we &apos;ve had with our mother yesterday â€” and I &apos;ve had some brilliant privilege of getting to come up with people like this , who said yesterday â€” ( Applause ) â€” who took their own selves and their knowledge to save other people , and I asked myself , why can you do this ?
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and cooperation are important .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they are emotions , not victims .
You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Go home &quot; &quot; and do that .
It can &apos;t be that I give two people the coordination and that &apos;s what they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
Where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , at the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of threats , all of these threats are crucial to us .
There &apos;s no personal matter .
A sleep may be a lack of resources , a long-term TEDster , but these are all things that work together to decrease the duration of our lives , all of which work together to reduce the duration of our lives .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re ready in social animals , where we live together and work together in what I call a sacrifice , as in a tribe where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we felt broken and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can go up the night and I can browse and see some of the risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , that means you &apos;re not going to look at the risks .
It &apos;s a wax-like system .
The modern world looks like this .
It &apos;s a world that &apos;s filled with risks that are struggling to make our lives harder or attempting to shrink our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to lower our chance of success .
These economies can grow as fast as possible in a market .
It could be a new technology that pulls your business crocodiles away at night , it could be a new technology that will stop you from doing your business crocodiles at night .
Or you can have a fight that sometimes tries to kill you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but at least it tries to steal your development and your business effort to drive away from you , it stops your growth and your business effort to lead you .
We have no control over these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions under which one organization is , and that &apos;s where the job ends , because it believes that the direction is .
When a leader picks up and chooses to protect the people in her organization and their lives for the protector of the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to look outward and profound results for people to have , and that is to look outward for people to have peace and to feel secure and to feel their personal relationships , we can look outward for things .
I was walking along a holiday path and I noticed an occurrence when a passenger attempted to get to the gate before he finished , and I watched the staff on the doorway to get to the man just like he was crying .
She was struck by a sperm whale when she attempted to stay still in awe for a walk .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep cutting things like that ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit in rows like us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer back .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we travel to visit our worldwide travels is not because they &apos;re attractive to the Lamanic people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give to their leaders .
You see , if conditions are right , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and it therefore makes organization worse .
What &apos;s a great leader , and I can show you the most close example of how to be a parent is a good leader , so the very best example of how to have a parent is how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent looks like , what do you want ? What builds a good parent ?
We want to give our children the opportunity , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the discipline , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the tools to grow and to achieve more for what we can do to grow and to have more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and doctrine , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , disciplines , when it &apos;s needed , they want to create self-esteem , they want to give them the opportunities to act so that they can achieve more things that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more advances than ever imagined .
Charlie Kump , who &apos;s the head of a tech company in New York City , is the head of a technology company called Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the head of a tech company called Next Jump in New York City , and they said , if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization , and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie has encouraged the responsibility for presidential applications , and Charlie has de-professionalized professional applications .
If you get a job in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of effectiveness .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will lead you and help you , in the same way that we would like to give to someone who comes to school and gives you a C.
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers who are running through the CEO &apos;s , and that &apos;s because all of these people are so frustrated and so damn hard , some of the bankers who are CEO &apos;s , that so many people are so damn frustrated and so damn stubborn , some of the bankers who are responsible for so many things and so many things .
It &apos;s not about data .
Instead , they listened to the fundamental principles of diversity .
They have grown a profound social society .
We know that they have proven their well-meaning children by virtue of their peers , and we know that they have proven their well-meaning children by virtue of their peers , instead of saying they have honored their well-meaning children , but they have told us that they have saved their well-being because of their well-being .
That &apos;s what proposes us , not data .
Could it be that , in terms of putting a billion dollars in business ?
Why didn &apos;t teacher give them 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save money .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save money .
Instead , they &apos;re going to give people a quick look at the data , but they &apos;re going to give people a quick look at saving .
They run a mini-bureaucratic administration company in the Bookshops Media , which is called Barry-Whemiller in 2008 , and they &apos;ve been rewarded by one of their top 20 percent in freeways .
Now in a big engineering firm , that &apos;s a big problem , and they won &apos;t be able to afford to buy their shoes more .
They needed 10 million dollars , and so many of the companies that we have today have accumulated and made huge progress .
And boy reacted to it .
You see , the bow doesn &apos;t trust the dragline .
Instead , it &apos;s very hard to believe in cheating , and it &apos;s very hard to reduce heart valves , and it &apos;s very hard to reduce heart valves .
And they built a dedicated program .
that every employee , every single one of them , would go to the CEO in four weeks without a plan .
They could never do that when they wanted to and they didn &apos;t have to .
But as Boeing declared the program , it becomes very important .
He said it was better than all of us to endure a little bit of a hurricane , because some of us would endure a lot of damage and get a lot more damage .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , then trust and cooperation is natural .
And structurally , as nobody expected , people started to trade each other .
The ones who were most successful did business with low-achieving people .
So some took five weeks to get somebody to participate in just three weeks .
Jihad is an extreme , not the other way around .
I know a lot of people who are responsible for the leading edge of organizations , and I know a lot of people who know the very leading edge of organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re employees , and we do what they say , because we have access to it , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people , who are in the middle of an organization that have no control and are a real leader , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege of seeing someone from the left , and it &apos;s because they have the privilege of seeing the person from the left , and they have the privilege of seeing the person on the right . And they have the responsibility of the person to the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some scientists that went out on the outskirts , and as philosophers use a way to cook in honor , and he feeds his men first , and when he &apos;s gone , he saves nothing for him .
And when he came back into the field , his men gave him some of their food and they could eat because that &apos;s it .
We tell them that they do it .
We call them leaders because they take risks first , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We tell them to lead because they choose to be safe so that people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be private so that people can be safe , we call them the leaders because they choose to be the victims so that people can be safe and that &apos;s how people can benefit them , and when we do that , natural responsibility is what people have to do .
They would give us their own blood and pneumonia and go to see if their leader &apos;s dream was reality , and when we asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you supply your blood and your pneumonia and your body to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do so for us . &quot; &quot; And is this not the organization that we would all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we want to work for all of us ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we want to work for all of us ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a story about Motetema from a small part of the Limpopo , which is also popularly known as the Limpopo and the Mumbai border .
Where the supply of water and electricity is really unbelievable , in these circumstances , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up once in 17 years , I was staying still in the winter with my friends in the winter .
The Sun in the winter is very warm .
And as I peeked in the bush , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Your , why don &apos;t you create something that just shows you in skin and doesn &apos;t work ? &quot; &quot; So I sat down , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Your , I need to buy it . &quot; &quot; And I did some research and I found some amazing statistics .
Today , 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-four million of them are in Africa , and there are many in South Africa alone .
Different diseases are found in this environment , which is the most dangerous tragedy known as the tragedy .
A breakthrough due to the loss of the eye , a revolution which is made possible by more than one of the most effective anti-smoking ads .
This disease kills eight million people every year , and one of the scariest things about it is that you only have to give up on your own childhood trial : no choice , no toys , no engineering .
After I looked at the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for at least because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then , I took my husband &apos;s 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet , I went on the Internet for 20 hours on Google , did some research on Wikipedia
And it seemed like a very nice challenge to me .
So , Mahatma was right , and our family was ready .
Now we need to put this in context .
Four years later , and the mobile phone , 40 pages long after I wrote down my patent on the phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent holder in the country and â€” ( &quot; &quot; now and Miss ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t say more than that . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , alternative to the first slogan of the world .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a pencil .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and confined resources , which I had , the Machine YoYo Glass entered a few new people , they &apos;ve been doing this , and now we have a fully integrated impact , which is ready for the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned a few lessons from DryBath commercializing and reaching people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They just buy it . There &apos;s one person in Alex who doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cigarettes . They buy a cigarettes every day , because that &apos;s how much it takes .
So we built DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just push it through and out .
And the cool thing is , a simple replacement of a cow is only five times .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about the consumption of products .
We even want rich kids of air molecules to get there . ( Laughter ) Once in a weekend .
However , what we felt was that we could save 80 million liters of water on average , whenever they leave and we could save two households for children who live in rural areas , two households , more than two hours for a school , two more households for children .
After we look at global impact , we &apos;ve taken advantage of our core values , health and serenity .
DryBath is the service of a rich man and a poor man &apos;s life .
In the process , we &apos;re actually entering a period of manufacturing that can be sold on a retail market , and a question that I &apos;ve had to ask for my audience today , at the Current of the Limpopo , within a week , we &apos;re devising a 50-pound hotel with an illumination device that doesn &apos;t have to be saved by the world .
What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that , I haven &apos;t done that .
And more importantly , I learned a lot from this crowd , which was Googled last year by me as the world &apos;s most teenager .
I &apos;m still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that comes with this account , and one of the things that surprised me is why I didn &apos;t want to do this for a living . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , what I &apos;m going to do today is share some of the results that I was excited about , and I also wondered what are the leading causes of success in companies â€” who are factors that are really due to initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to create a better place in the world .
If you select a group of people with the desire to equality waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find all the human abilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is the majority of them going to fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to investigate this very organized , to draw down many of my most creative ideas and misconceptions that had been framed for me in the last few centuries .
I wanted to know this because I was beginning various business at the age of 12 , starting with a low-performing Jewish teacher at a low-performing school , all the way to school when I was designing solar systems , then the school , when I was making low-performing .
I graduated from college , and I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the Alliance for the Alliance for Climate Protocol , we launched 100 companies in the last 20 years , and we have made dramatic breakthroughs .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain why organizations are the leading cause of success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there &apos;s something .
That &apos;s why I put out my company &apos;s name Aida Libra , the old moment that you get when you think about it .
Through considering , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to check or collapse , is more important than I think .
I never imagined that you were going to be speaking at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan , until I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team has the potential to connect control to the reading of a car .
Cooking is an integral reality .
So I thought that maybe the team was the most important thing .
So I started to look at the business model .
Does an organization have an explicit approach to income ?
With that in mind , I thought growing up was the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
After this , of course â€” is it time ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s fast , so you &apos;re going to go and teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or was it too late , and already scared ?
So I devised these five factors very carefully in many of the institutions .
And the idea was to take over 100 companies in the Libya , and over 100 of them outside to try and find a scientific result .
So first of all , these new Libra companies , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , Good , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” all of these are a cash of billions of dollars .
And the top five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink â€” were very hopeful for us , but not luck .
So I tried to organize these identities as I think these companies had progressed in these categories .
And then in the businesses outside Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
And here are some things : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
Next companies had good investments , and sometimes they had a market model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out what was the most effective of all the cash and error in all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was the choice of time .
At the right time , it &apos;s 42 percent of what &apos;s leading to success and failure .
It &apos;s on the other hand , the team and the way around , and then , thinking differently , individually , it &apos;s actually number three .
But the fact that it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not that ideas don &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was shocked to learn that belief is not the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , a market model and investment comes in my mind .
I think a market model is still cheaper , because you can start without a market model in the aftermath of making factories , you can put it in .
And investing , if initially it was low-income but now it &apos;s increasing , particularly today , is very easy to get investment .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these nodes here .
Take the big success of Airbnb , as everybody knows .
Now , notice that this company had lots of investors in it because people thought , well , who &apos;s going to give a certain amount of money to some of their homes ?
Well , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of metaphors is that the best market model , the workforce , and the merit perspective is the right time .
This company came in confronted with financial challenges when people needed additional support , and this made sure to help people react to the confidence that their insurance was in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber comes in , the best company , the best market model , the best thinkers .
But , time was absolutely right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders also had aspirations for additional income ; that was really needed .
Some things , as Citysearch arrived at the time when people needed a page .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 here at TED , was around the time when companies wanted to look outward for influence in the systems .
We thought the best , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so thrilled with this â€” so many workers and a wonderful market model , we had to work with the great Hale Voyd artists .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broad Internet was much smaller .
It was really hard to see the online video , you have to code in your browser and not know what to do , and in 2003 , this company reached its end .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of coding and broadband in the United States , more than 50 percent of them died , came to YouTube .
Great , good time .
As it turns out , YouTube had no commercial model of it .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was the most optimal time .
So to cut a long story short , perspectives are really important .
Ideas matter a lot .
But perhaps time is critical .
And the best way to value time is to see if you really are ready for your own biography .
And it &apos;s absolutely unbelievable that what you get out of your search engine , because if you want something , you should stay ahead , but in the case of time frame , you have to be very reliable .
As it said , early organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help you increase your chance of succeeding , and then not be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 April 2016 &#93; &#91; We saw the biggest data shelter in history &#93; &#91; French accents dreamed up with rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; a shelter of money for small companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve done the job to unveil the traffic of the Gulf Voters . &#93; &#91; A revolution in this week has been the center of a revolution that brought
In half of the videos , these papers were documented by secret weekend firms from small arms companies .
We get to know the inner stories of cows , benchmarks and villages who come in with patterns like the Muhammad Fund and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a workaholic company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see the emails , you can actually see the transfer of texts , you can see the way you do things , the way you do things .
The impact has just begun to be visible .
The head of the United Nations has been covered .
We also heard about the weekly dating companies that were surviving in male-dominated literature .
The revenue of two billion dollars goes to the Royal Academy of May , to his childhood friend , a famous sitcom .
And so many rich people will be infected , and so many of those stories from the future will be at home with more hidden documentaries .
Now that sounds like a magic video or a John Gutzpah novel .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that overwhelmingly and powerful people sit in the search for their money , and the more they shouldn &apos;t be able to tax , the more affordable it means that wealth and education happens , like teaching and health .
And this affects all of us .
My foundation for Galapagos Ventures is quite amazing .
And global media and political leaders are talking about how people can shrink their influence in the weekly societies that we &apos;ve been discussing with our friends .
I think it &apos;s a world that &apos;s worth sharing for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like a roomful of girls .
You can log in to another company within a company , a company with a second company , almost impossible to figure out who was behind this space .
Companies for Disease Control , coverage , school , school is hard to understand what &apos;s going on .
And I think that &apos;s interesting , because in the United States , we never talked about it very much .
Perhaps this is because Americans don &apos;t have to be in that scene .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no rich people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in road companies .
It &apos;s due to the rebus fare company , a few of the American cities in Mosques .
I think if we read Abraham novels or deal with Dil Windows or Huxley or Huxley or Reward , things that are much more connected to the United States .
Instead , a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give you this information , you have to give you less information in order to get the company to do the job .
This is what happens to students in the U.S.
Nine venture capital takes a lot of money .
This kind of cross-pollination affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to see what this problem looks like .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we took a sabbatical and we sent it to the 13 Dutch legal companies .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transfer to the homeless America , a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The upshot is that all of the villages , all of them , had to give us a two-way guess of how to move the load .
These were all the early stages , and for some time we hadn &apos;t made our money , and we hadn &apos;t given anyone a money , but this was a bad idea of the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual weakness that has talked to us about hidden subjects and proposals .
It &apos;s not just about a census politician who &apos;s found in the census .
It &apos;s a system that works , that secures cutting , pollution , poverty and unemployment .
And in order to have that , we have to change this game .
We &apos;re going to have to change the rules of the game so that it can be hard to create in this way .
It may be ironic , because what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been following the leap forward towards transparency where the company has taken over .
Now , the issue was on political cards , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Department of Defense wrote down in eight seconds that were happening in South America in 2013 .
And Europe has been building a global record , a central record of who is actually a country of companies or is controlling them .
What you find is that the ECM is behind it .
Different zoning on a scale of contradictions in the center and the Senate , whose development we wanted was not that big , so we were 15 .
We want to look at the discoveries , the rocket companies , the big sections , which were used throughout the world and around the U.S.
This is a moment of change in Galapagos .
We need to reach the people for grief and harm , for those of you who know your knowledge , behind the burning companies .
You know , they speak up , they &apos;re not good enough to pass on this kind of thing .
Politicians need to acknowledge this problem , and promote a legislative change to blind information .
We can aggregate this privacy section which is responsible for the cutting and the bullying .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that the Lex , the inventor of you , has had so much meaning in the last few years that most of the media in the world is .
Can it be true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , could it be true ?
That &apos;s a little bit of a â€” isn &apos;t it ? â€” that the media all over the world is showing us how bad it is to get a small group of employees to share information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : What &apos;s that like ?
How do people write documents ?
And how do you stay passionate ?
Julie Singer : Yes , these are â€” I can say it all â€” public goods in the right way . And we have so many ways to get this information to us .
Therefore , we use a vast amount of high-speed storage to shift material from one place online to another , to clear a sign from legal contracts like Sweden and blogging .
We get the information that &apos;s accessible , through regular DDDs , through Ramadan , or whatever , they organize like normal news organizations , they frame â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about mass media and mass media , and then protect yourself against foreign policy makers and politics .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to try to make sure the document is real , but you actually never know what the tool is .
Julie Singer : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ve always heard that before , and if we get there at a stage , soon we just dismiss the information .
( Clang ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s coming from here and asking what &apos;s the code for TED . ( Laughter )
Take an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you wrote a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s the report .
It was a secret magic report that the Kenyan government formed after the elections in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government survived there for 18 years the Daniel Arab Emirates .
He was a south Indian village in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the books â€” these were the tools of the authorities who were trying to find out how to source a report , they put 20 million pounds into the report , one in report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for their political will , which was the wealthiest man â€” now is the wealthiest man in Kenya .
For the Kenyan press , Jim is Jesus .
That &apos;s why it was launched in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this very first election in December 2008 .
When we launched that report , we made that report three days later for the new president , and Kabul decided to become a friend of the homeless person , Donnell April , so she stuck a report in the back of the mall .
CA : And â€” well , I mean , to put it very briefly â€” it &apos;s just been launched in Kenya , not out of business , but out of the mean , it changed the product of your choice .
Julin Sength : Yes . This is the headlines of Gaddafi and then the spread in all the major countries of Kenya and Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he , a couple of days later , convinced the Kenyan press to talk about this .
And that blog was on television for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the ratio of Wales to 10 percent , according to an online gender report in Kenya , and it changed the game .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your secret agenda really changed the world ?
Julin Sength : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : There we go . We &apos;re going to show you a little clip of a well-meaning film .
This video is so long , but here &apos;s a little clip of something .
This â€” I &apos;ll let you know , a high-definition video .
Radio : ... bitterness , by the time you reach them , you touch them .
I found , uh-oh , there are four things with them .
The way is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they come to you , tell me . Go home .
Hi .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Gill gets off . Gill gets off . ( Machine noises ) Gill gets off .
Hatzalah â€” two great masters , two great masters .
We should now walk . It &apos;s time .
Okay , so now we &apos;ve got eight people .
Yes , we &apos;re seeing two Hilly Kuppers , and we &apos;re still chasing cells .
Raleigh . They &apos;re on my side .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hi , Jill . Okay . Yes , I have .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julie Singer : People who worked on it had a profound effect on it .
We finally got two people excited , and we did some more research .
It was the first of three that happened .
CA : So there were 11 people who died in the crash , two of whaleship readers ?
Julie Singer : Yes ! Two employees of the Reuters , two little children were killed .
In total , 26 out of every 18 people died .
CA : And there were a lot of crap with him .
What was the primary cause of the trouble , you think ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with a deep disbalance of power .
On the one hand , some people are going into the Gulf and then a kilometer from the U.S. Capitol is beginning to develop 30 miles of cells for anyone â€” pretty much anyone â€” and killing the refugees .
There were two journalists who were no longer oppressed , because their jobs were journalists .
CA : Well , the U.S. intelligence agency called Brad Messing , and it said that he had confirmed in Cestro that he videotaped 232,000 and a half thousand other U.S. subscriptions as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Singer : So we decided to accept the document .
The impact on this is that just five days ago , we received over 150,000 documentaries and over 50,000 comments .
But we &apos;ve gone back and forth in the beginning of the year to a report of the Roman and the American Charter House , but there is no correlation .
I mean , I went to the safari room a lot .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got a thousand surveys from the American hotel ...
Julie Singer : We &apos;ll follow them . ( CA : Would you do it ? ) Julie Singer : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julie Singer : Because things like this show that actually , what are the kinds of states that people have , for example , in Arab states , represent human rights violations in these states .
If you look at the hidden documents of this material , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Let &apos;s play with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why would you decipher information ?
Julie Singer : Yes , the question is how important data in the world is , what data can be driven ?
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out of the company to stay secure , when you have to get the information out , you &apos;re hoping to do something good , because those organizations know better , and you know what else , they care about .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of press .
CA : But are there risks to it as individuals or as a collective society , where innovation is unexpected ?
Julie Singer : We filmed documents with them , so that &apos;s not what happened .
I mean , our biggest duty is practice .
We use information to tap into a very personalized way of interacting with the information that &apos;s personally inspired â€” the information that &apos;s available to someone .
But there are also some mysteries . For example , your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magic secret â€” but we &apos;re talking about the public goods that are coming in and out of courage .
CA : OK , so they &apos;ve been able to do it very carefully .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , is someone who is a father , a son of the American military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had this effect that some people like to heal .
One of the things that contains in this is that Americans are healthy about dead .
Which affects â€” but it has put millions of people around the world who are obsessed with the U.S. military .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Singer : Let &apos;s answer a lot of questions like this .
But remember , in the abdomen , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan â€” you don &apos;t need to stream video , they look at it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what their fears are , it doesn &apos;t matter what their perceptions are .
Because they look at it every day .
It will change the incentive and the way they think they pay , and this is what we hope .
CA : OK , so you look to hope for what you think of as secret information for companies and governments .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous if you wanted to have this light in order to have self-organization in order to have that kind of openness ?
Julie Singer : No . I mean , we &apos;re not a different cell .
We don &apos;t have the kind of information that is abused by other minds .
If they do that , then we have a very difficult situation , but what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re treating people with a moral responsibility to think that they &apos;re doing it tomorrow .
CA : I think we &apos;ve made a difference â€” I think we &apos;ve made a difference â€” with the subject here , getting irony .
You can also imagine that there will be various breakthroughs about the lions and the lions .
One is the hero of hope .
Or trouble .
What does the status quo look like ?
What about creating problems ?
Julie Singer : Oh ! There must be something .
CA : These are great people , Julie , great .
We have to try and do . Let me give you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet . But I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Now , this is a really interesting story , a little old , isn &apos;t it ?
What is that ?
Julie Singer : Here &apos;s an example of what we do every day .
Last year , at the end of the year â€” in November there was a massive leak in the bananas , as was happening in Mexico , but not so big .
And we got the report card â€” what happened was a very good analysis of this â€” which was that , in fact , they said that different counter-terrorists against different oil companies , they stood there and they spoke .
And there were some bankers and things like that .
And there was nothing on that report . That was why we had a very difficult job .
We couldn &apos;t believe it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , might this company have done this all in a game ?
That &apos;s the foundation we put in , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
That material is so good , and it seems good to see , but we can &apos;t make a guess about it . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that this was written , and they wanted to be able to take a look at the device . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to look at the device . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show up blessing that you really care about her ?
Did it really be you ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us what we see on Scripture with the name of the factory with the name of the microwave iPad .
Yes .
( Applause ) It &apos;s happened many times .
It &apos;s a way to exemplify and illustrate what the material is , and that is to try to write and get the letter from these people .
CA : All right . So , have you ever got that information from inside the BBC ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we &apos;re accumulating and mixing things like difficult times .
So our petition to publish this has become somewhat of a touchpad in the last few months because we &apos;re refining our beta system because of the rare public goods that we have .
It &apos;s abnormal .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s playing , our ability to connect more with us is because of our growth , and that means we have a large number of public goods that are really smart , but we don &apos;t have that many people that are committed to processing and building this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , why was it that journalists or journalists were yearning to work ?
Julie Singer : Yes . And trust people .
I mean , we have an organization that &apos;s really hard to follow , because with the material that &apos;s accessible to us , we have to organize so that we can bring people who have a very strong sense of what conservation is , and then we have to think about things .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to work on that .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , my parents were in the movies of the movies and then ran away from the city , so that &apos;s why these two things had an effect .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychologist , so it &apos;s just saying that if you put something together , you can create a mental illness .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were just one of the big guys just at the age , and you were kind of on the verge of rational .
Julie Singer : Yes , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist at a very early age .
I wrote a letter , and I booked in that moment that when I fell down in love with the crime .
So you need to appreciate the word and appreciate the word .
I mean , there &apos;s a way that you can use a lot of different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Rockefeller that &apos;s using the Rockefeller model to cover the bank of your grandmother .
That &apos;s why the word , now , isn &apos;t as useful as it was before .
CA : Yes , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a lawyer of a Grandmother &apos;s bank , but do you think of your core values ?
Can you tell us something about what they are , and perhaps one event in your life that helped them survive ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in the facts .
But the basic values : good , talented and evil people don &apos;t create the victims ; they grow up .
And that &apos;s the lesson I learned from my father and some other brilliant , aggressive people who are in my life .
CA : And good , heavy people don &apos;t generate great people , do they grow up ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed guy , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow â€” there &apos;s another way to get the lead , which is nearby to the police , crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been going on for a very long time .
CA : So let &apos;s just tell us one last time : What happened in the United States ?
Basically , what you published there was a problem with a bank , and then they gave the newspapers a few contradictions of their own story .
Instead , they showed you your situation .
Which made you very famous in the audience . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ice Valley went into a crisis .
There he exploded .
The bank had grown 10 times larger than the rest of the country &apos;s GDP .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the state of Tehran ran ran five minutes before the present , and as a movie : &quot; Terrible News , and the state of the news reader was , &quot; It never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed up on the website , time-consuming all the time , and we were very popular in the Ice Valley , I went to Ice Land talked about this problem .
And the elements of the people there seemed not to be the same again , and as a result , the scientists in the United Nations , working with some other international experts , we devised a new kind of Isaac Linda , which is a sort of freedom medicine , because journalists from around the world are so safe , they come with new Nobel Prize winners .
A country like Ice Land the Netherlands are like a fight , which means the system heads up from the bottom .
And just one month ago , the alliance parliamentarians of Los Angeles adopted this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater privacy , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will come .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to be made to match the laws of free demand and and laws of transparency , all over the world â€” in Europe , in China and the U.S.
Which one is it ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so it &apos;s a really interesting time to live â€” because with a small attempt , we can move it side or side .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience into what they call , Girl , with respect , and for all your power .
Julie Singer : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at stuff .
I don &apos;t like to play and watch .
So I did this , which is a meat closer .
I walked past my childhood around the kitchen , and this seemed like a failure in the kitchen .
When I went back to college and came back to the early &apos; 90s , I got this .
My team smiled .
And when I looked at it from a fresh perspective , I suddenly realized how the rest of the world is thinking about it ?
And when I went to church mines everywhere I go , surprisingly , to the North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or to the South Indian Empire , I noticed that the four creatures were embedded inside these â€” cold , dark , silent and code .
And I thought that was really strange , and I was wondering whether anyone else would ever take the form of a mockingbird .
And when I approached it , it occurred to me that people were not looking at the cannibals .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Growing the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human character .
And this is something that we did 10,000 years ago when we analyzed our cities .
If you look at fires 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see them colliding and bumping , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back to 2,000 years ago , you would see just four animals : corn , cow , alcohol , organ .
It &apos;s true for the ant .
If you look at plane trajectories in New York City 150 or 200 years ago , you would see cartoon , puzzle and puzzle pieces .
But if you look at the far end , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re only going to be able to be able to have four generations â€” ring , ring , but also leading .
It understands that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did we get here ?
Shaheen .
It &apos;s a brand new problem .
And this is how we &apos;re moving forward in the last 50 years .
World War II , we were fascinated by Hazrat Ali .
In the midst of the War , we developed technologies like the snowmobiles , the polymers , and so on , the whole thing .
And from the end of the Second World War , we have come to see the dramatic increases in the capacity of catastrophe .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soil farm and the sea farm have grown exponentially , and for the last two years , its income has gone up from this collective moisture .
Now if you collect forest pollution and forest pollution , it &apos;s going to be equal to two Chinese who are born out of the sea every year .
For example , my Chinese countertopic has no reason , because China is not only one of the largest importers , but it is also the biggest emphasis .
Now let &apos;s move to our four choices .
The first is the mostly used salt in the U.S. and the West .
In the West , Level is a critical source of evil .
All you do is kill a pound forest gap 5 , 10 , or 15 pounds-worth of forest gains to the market .
The Indus Valley also has an unbelievable level of honor .
In a study done in a Dutch University , it proved that reading gasoline from a local fluid is actually ineffective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
The ranks of cannibals in the forest are the management wars .
Now look at these cute girls .
They clean the soil from their local backyard , cleaning the beaches , cleaning and cleaning the kitchen for all sorts of important things to the environment .
A lot of this has happened in the civil war .
Over the past 30 or 40 years , we have lost millions of icons of coal .
Another action that &apos;s going on here , what the Philippines call &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You just saw a little bit on the track , it &apos;s very controversial .
Today , what &apos;s happening is that the bats are breaking down from the nine , but with so much more and more mosquitos , they will shrink the other mosquitos and then dump them into the lunchroom .
And many times , it &apos;s working with the slaughterhouses that are named &quot; &quot; Reddit , &quot; &quot; which are the mosque that we &apos;d like to see on the river means that the ecosystem is actually poisoning itself and being cool .
Later on , we get to the second largest cultured food in the United States and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
The tuna actually has to pay attention to very large areas for the organization to form .
We have a zone called the scientific Environments Organization , or the ICCAT , for Internet Conservation , Self-Organized Learning Environments .
And the great reader of all the tuna was , of course , great .
We can stand on the surface of Titan , but there &apos;s no good duty to stand on the surface .
Not many people know , but it &apos;s warm blood .
It goes up to over 40 miles an hour , and bodies can heat up to 20 degrees Celsius .
The whole floor of this material is almost done .
A blood vessel is filled with leather that doesn &apos;t flow very fast .
It &apos;s great for proteins .
But those wild creatures that survive 40 miles an hour are not able to live in the forest .
Sharmeen has been well established , it &apos;s not necessarily because of the season .
This is my political contact .
The concrete was covering the forest floor .
If you look at a map of content , you have to map every single dot .
There are over 3,000 signs in the politics of Conetta .
Actually , I say , there &apos;s more people in the connectome . ( Laughter ) If someone takes the power of a connectome , I think we can make a much better world .
And everywhere are the traditions of these traditions that are struggling to give to children .
As a result , we have a successful campaign for the campaign and the campaign .
When the ship began to sink beneath the swells , it was cutting six pounds of forest floor for the ship to form one single ball .
But now it &apos;s gone much better .
Instead , what you find is a little bit of false drinking water , because if you look at the Freedom Facebook , they &apos;re called the Zimbabwe peanut button instead of a Facebook page .
But Facebook is torn up by a mosque .
It &apos;s hard to say something like bananas and chocolate .
But then the whole market mechanism says , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , it &apos;s pumped into a new fund .
This is a system that produces electrical energy , which is gasoline .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the year .
Although we are spending enough money to go to the marketplace , we are spending less money , but we are also spending a lot of money .
We were not only raising chickens , we were raising chickens and chickens .
We have what &apos;s eating the eggs , and we have what &apos;s eating the eggs .
Because leather , through the leather , through the hands and so on , you can pay the bills .
I wonder if there &apos;s a mosquito that beats up but it unfolds the leaves .
India is the first or the first one . ( Laughter ) As a result , this is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third piece of China , or the entire U.S. , that &apos;s getting out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia literally started as a liver .
And it started when a local financer noticed that the next day he would never meet on the Mall .
He went to the park and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s look at the patterns .
The censorship that the censorship would most likely make for the ocean was a document that Hulu does not win .
So he made his own lift song .
Sadly , the census was over 30 seconds .
He wanted to create a 25-cent cylinder , so he could open the Atlantic Code .
This entrepreneurial police offers us the largest mass-market art industry in the United States , 2,000 to three billion pounds of food a year .
If we stop the pollution , the alternative would be tripled .
Twenty years ago , nobody knew anything about Italy .
It really changes the proteins in the animal proteins in a very dynamic way , and this is really the third world .
Actually , that &apos;s a really clear solution that &apos;s coming out in nine months from an adult .
The trouble is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a dirty kitchen .
It &apos;s not even ACEs and DNA that we think will save us all the time .
So what are we going to do next ?
I mean , this poor , happy clip .
This represents the large sum of 30 million tons .
A window of opportunity for conservation is to say , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of giving it peace ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a wonderful childish child to go to the marketplace , a typical part of slavery against slavery and the most effective part of the ranch of the Indus Valley .
This is among the top three , ACEs and DNA .
So here &apos;s his potential .
But what if instead of taking our way , instead of paying a few bucks to Pune , or Pop Tunes , and turning it into a Facebook page , we could customize the deliveryman with these dubious goods to pay the dubious goods ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPACs and ADHD .
The Indus calculus is incredibly effective .
The meat that you need to measure is only about three percent of the meat that &apos;s produced in the market .
In fact , probably three of them don &apos;t come from the kitchen .
The sea level rises by three times in the mosque , so they just collect .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western world , it &apos;s been lost entirely by the use of Facebook and Netization .
Over the past 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , these are the leading cause of death in the sea .
So as you might think about Kallikuppam , in all these different conditions , the proteins , and the average is three times more productive .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a lesson that will provide the benefits of commercial protein .
It has to be a green saber , tightly growing and changing environment , just like a small pig in it , and it has to be an EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and the Facebook .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the last 15 years .
Whenever I do that , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do that . We can do that .
But he &apos;s trying to give it a try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
And if we do that , the third piece of the world &apos;s population is nearly 30 million in the oceans .
I mean , it &apos;s all going on .
We want to think about what we don &apos;t need .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to take a little while .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I had the big brain reading because I have a brother who &apos;s a neurological illness issue called Scottisafia .
As a scientist , I wanted to understand , how can I connect my dreams with my reality and make my dreams better ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what it means is that they don &apos;t integrate their dreams into a common reality and they work on it .
So I spent my life researching serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my in-law school in India , where I worked at the head of Dr. Francesca Bank , who was in Philadelphia at Harvard University .
So , what &apos;s the difference between the questions that were searching for the metabolic level , the people who generally imagine , compared to the people who are in the brain of Scottish imaging , or &quot; &quot; Schizophobe , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Purple Does , &quot; &quot; so what really we were trying to do is make a map of the brain &apos;s psychic map , and who are the cells that are sending
So there was a lot of damage in my life because I was studying this kind of study every day , but on a weekend and weekend I was going to take my way to Newcastle Orange on those antennas .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I was asked to find out that I was faced with an intellectual adventure .
The lower part of my brain was a nose .
And over the next four hours , I watched my brain become completely disconnected by any ability to understand information .
I was able to write chalk to speak to each other on a Friday morning .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve got a brain scan to show you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the upper part of the brain , the lower part of the brain , and it &apos;s going to stay in my head .
And when you look inside the brain , you will see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
For those of you who think of computers , the right part of our brain is acting like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain is acting like a travel processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the body of a reef that &apos;s covering over 300 spacecraft .
But there are also two components of this .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing each part has a totally different knowledge about the different things , and if you allow for that , I think of their identities as different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . Compassion .
SOC : Well done .
( Laughter ) The evidence we have in our brains is just now , and we think about this moment .
Right now , we &apos;re thinking about parts of our brain , and it &apos;s thinking organically about the movements of our body .
Information is shaped down in the spaces of time and learns from all of our systems through neuroscience , and then it &apos;s shaped down in the form of a great alphabet class , which , at the present time , tells us what &apos;s happening in the world and how to feel and how to feel .
I &apos;m an energy gear that &apos;s related to the energy surrounding itself through the right brain &apos;s consciousness .
We are the energy systems connected to each other through the awareness of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at that moment , we are brothers and sisters on this planet who are responsible for making this world a better place .
And at that moment , we are truly the best and the most beautiful .
The right part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The rest of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is based on the fact that we have today &apos;s largest alphabet analysis and analytics , and then we begin to collect these analytics .
And it also organizes and facilitates this information that links up all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of the future , namely , for our projects .
The right part of our brain is thinking of the linguistic scripts .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that touches us and our inner world with the world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that , really , you have to remember to go home and buy and choose .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a kind of awareness of me creating a book in county that reminds me of where I spend .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; I ! I am ! &quot;
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I become deeply disgusted .
I &apos;m the only guy who &apos;s ever turned into a deep figure of power from around me and from you .
And that same part of my brain experienced firsthand the same death sentence that morning .
On the morning of judgment , my left eye in the back of my eye , a huge pain .
It was as painful as it was to get the axis of the axis .
And that pain that connected me and left me behind .
It stops , and then it stops .
It was an unusual thing for me , and I &apos;ve never experienced any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I put on my card billboard , which is a typical body training machine .
Now , I get in touch with this device , because it feels like I &apos;m holding a copy of a very early human hand attached to the DNA .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a big deal , &quot; &quot; and then I look around my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is the big , unusual thing . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the way I had changed my mind , which is really a public sense of what a human being is doing out of this experience , but now I was in a very humble and unusual place where I was conscious of the experience
And it was all very strange and poor , and I had an increasing heart rate .
So I went out of the machine and I started to walk into the room and I realized that everything in my body was going off .
And all of those are very tough , very thinkable .
I have no relationships at all , and I think there &apos;s a housekeeping problem , so I think it &apos;s only about the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my sewery cabin ready to get underwater , and I &apos;m really listening to a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice saying , &quot; &quot; My brother , I need you now .
Yes , my foot goes down , and then my balance goes on , and I grab the branch and I come across the wall .
I reach out and look at my hand , and I realize that I now can &apos;t reframe the waves of my body .
I have no idea where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to stop because my hand and my hand are put together with the atom and the microwave .
If I was understanding something , it was energy ...
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the speech on the left of my brain has become completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice is TVs on a monitor .
A brewery .
Before that , I was blown away by the silence of my brain .
But then immediately after that , I suddenly found myself in this huge umbrella of energy all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt great , I felt great , I felt powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then one of the blood vessels rushed to the left of my brain and said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re going to take a breath . &quot;
We need to help them , and I said to myself , I really have a problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I &apos;m really dubious about the problem , but I came back to the very same consciousness that I talk about a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Check out how beautiful it is to be in a place where you are completely tied to this tiny brain of the outer world around you .
So I &apos;m in this room where my sleep and my stress level are all about it .
I felt a lot of shame in my body .
And look , all of your relationships that go out into the world and into thinking of it have gone missing .
And I felt a sense of peace and compassion .
And measure what it would look like if you were left behind this 70-year-old emotional load you stood up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I went like a millionaire .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the top of my head and he said , &quot; Hey , give it another two . &quot;
We need someone , and I &apos;m thinking that I should help me become better than that , so I bumped into the back of the house and I bumped into machinery and now I &apos;m walking into my yard and I &apos;m thinking , can I get into work ? &quot; &quot; And in that moment , my hands are completely broken .
At that moment , it occurred to me that my God is hitting me from Philadelphia , the next thing that my mind tells me is how great this is .
( Laughter ) What a gift !
Some neuroscientists are going to have this opportunity to realize that they can awareness their own brains and that they can go inside . ( Laughter ) Then a bone came to my brain . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But I &apos;m a huge woman . ( Laughter ) I have no time to frame . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fight , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my habits . Okay .
I &apos;ve got to get a phone call . I &apos;ve got to get a phone call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the first thing I did , and then I remembered I had my biggest card on the phone .
So I go into my study room and I pick up three inches of Matthew cards .
And I &apos;m peering at the top of the card while I can see my brain &apos;s eye clearly and see what my bookshelves look like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card I haven &apos;t , because I haven &apos;t looked at any of these angles .
And words on paper are going to be correlated with the maps and the marks , and I &apos;m not reading anything .
So I started waiting for what I call the illustration office .
And at that moment , the normal truth was repeated , and I found that it &apos;s not a card , it &apos;s not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to decrease the slide into just one inch .
And in those 45 minutes , the impact on the fuel was on the left .
I don &apos;t have the number . I don &apos;t have the telephone , but I have no way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in there .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I look at the cards of big girls on the phone as big cats .
But then I picked myself up to my pile when I came back , I didn &apos;t remember I &apos;d asked him a number .
So I took my fuel , I raised my hand like a dude and I put it in the Hindus , and then I put it in my other hand and said , &quot; &quot; When I get back to the normal reality , I can tell you I went back to India first , and then I get all the way to all the India , and I hear that there &apos;s a guy who raised the phone in my hand and said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
And so I say this in my mind clearly , &quot; I &apos;m talking to you , I need help . &quot;
And from my voice , there &apos;s things like &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he came to me that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and I didn &apos;t understand it until I tried to .
So he understood that I needed help and he supported me .
Shortly after that , another ambulance arrived at four o &apos;clock in the Boston Massacre at the other end of the hospital .
I walked down and it looked like a small boy .
Just like the one story in which the rest of me took a little bit and climbed out of poverty , I took my energy out , and I felt the weakness of my spirit .
And it was then that I realized that I wasn &apos;t really in control with my life .
Or , the doctor saved me and offers me a second life or a second time for me to transition .
By the time I finished , I was shocked to find out that I was still alive .
When I experienced my spirit in heavy , then I said to God .
Now my brain was inflated twice the contrary between reality .
At that time , I started to realize the emotions in my emotional system were only empathizing with the pain .
Like a fire in the forest , my brain was so dense and so strong that I could barely hear a voice coming in because of the background , or I could barely hear a voice , and I was just peddling my way out .
Because I had no idea how to position my body in the mirror , I felt so big and so wide , like a person who was free from my whiskey .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant elephant standing in the ocean of dirty water .
Great Neuron .
I learned the quality of it .
And I remembered thinking it was never going to be possible that I could find my own great sister and be able to connect with the inside of a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive and I &apos;ve been incarcerated .
And if I &apos;m gone blind , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is capable of getting neurons , I &apos;ve seen a world filled with beauty , praise , comfort and love , people who know they can feel this quality at any time .
And they can be chosen to find out when they want to take their way to the left of their brain and look for transparent quality .
And then I realized how this experiment could be a gift . &quot; &quot; It was a kind of a shelter that taught me how to live .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a half-hour of judgment , the rain came down from my brain , blood warning over a large part of my brain , and it was detecting the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real division in my life .
It took me eight years to become completely healthy .
So who are we then ?
We are the most powerful branches of life with advanced skills and two very highly opaque brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world of who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step to the right of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the most powerful force in life in the universe .
Fifty-five beautiful cells are made up of cells , sort of , everywhere in the world .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a tight form .
From quantum entanglement to space .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
I have an inside us .
What would you choose ?
What would you choose ?
And when ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain looking for alternative electrical activity , the more we put peace in this world and the more we make our planet more affordable .
And I thought that was worth spreading this idea .
Thank you .

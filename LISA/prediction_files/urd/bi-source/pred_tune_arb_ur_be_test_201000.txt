Good morning !
Are you people staying ?
They picked up my name for my name , but I want to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No ! No ? Well , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little while ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and I refused to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have a free food desert in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , I thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Solly ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The Council of Divatives , in Arabic . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Gosh , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Block said .
And he was talking to me , as he was saying to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I can &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does it mean for &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A young boy who had made two words and placed a girl specifically .
How can they speak this way ?
That &apos;s the moment I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Oh sure !
What &apos;s stopping me from giving my language to my country ?
Where could it be ?
How did we get there ?
Now , while we &apos;re here , I &apos;m here as many people as I know , who reach a stage in their lives where they routinely outperform anything that &apos;s in their past , just because they &apos;re so much more glorious and so depressed .
Should I be bringing all my culture , my ideas , my spirit and dreams ?
Could we have a lasting battle in the stories of children ?
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
to be liked ?
How does that work ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for my boss as much as I did for me .
The Arabic language does not ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research , that we &apos;re using in the University , the language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we publish when we work on a research program , and it &apos;s not really the language that we use every day .
If we did that , they would circle us around .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s a second more important fact that we need to think about .
The Arabic mother tongue .
Our research tells us that in other languages , we need to translate our own mother tongue .
In other languages , the intrinsic language of creativity is the basic unit of language .
How ?
Jeffrey Gabriel , when she started writing , she started using Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imagine and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a sense of gratitude , a special voice , and thought about a special idea .
When they started writing in English , they had enough materials .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their English texts , you felt the same sense of gratitude , the same awareness .
You can imagine that these are the same scripts in English , the same little boy who lives in an urban center of Johnson .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China all have that in common .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in resources , they spend a lot of money on dissemination and envy .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this evolved mindset we haven &apos;t yet gotten , and we want to move into this developed world .
They were countries like us at one time , but they decided to try to move forward , to research , to move to countries , such as Taiwan , employees , and so on , to translate their language with what they were doing to the students : to protect them , like Hasbro .
They kept it near them .
Because if you &apos;re a traveler or a car and you don &apos;t write about it in a marketplace , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe these are local manufacturing .
And they will be included in these unknown consumers , as we know them more time .
So for new inventions and new applications , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Rain , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how and how .
Languages are not just about the conversation , only the words are receiving us .
Languages have a very specific set of levels of our lives , and the words that are connected from our senses .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Rain , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special circuit in your mind for a given day in a unique history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that has to do with what we think , and how we look at each other and how we view ourselves .
What is our intuition ?
How would you say you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the age of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , well , I &apos;ll go ahead and spend a lot of time talking about beer .
It &apos;s just that they remind us of one thing .
I have a French speaker friend who &apos;s won a French speaker .
I was asking her for a second .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to cook and translate his wife , I spent the night trying to translate what &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The woman abruptly called &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand her .
And he was wondering , how could it be that way ?
Do they want to self-destruction ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Chieko and two ) This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way to think about it is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me for a day , and one night , I tried to translate it to him to feel what I feel when I hear February . &quot; &quot; And this woman had tried to translate that , &quot; &quot; I have raised her hand and you &apos;ve taken it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she said this : And because you &apos;re me , I put my hand up and I left you . (
He translates . He shows me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to make the language abundant ?
We changed it for a society , and we started an Arabic language conservation campaign .
While lots of people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Please don &apos;t worry , commit yourself . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language conservation campaign ignited a phrase , which is , &quot; I talk to you East , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t understand this method , because in this way , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate speaking in Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be responsible in the way that our dreams , our dreams , and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the same as ourselves and the same as us .
So this message , &quot; &quot; I talk to you East , but you answer the West . &quot; &quot; Get the right sign .
It &apos;s very easy but expensive and efficient .
Later , we started a new milestone with the planetary presence of letters .
You see , out there , you see an example , in a context with the letter black and blue on a touch pad , with the text saying , don &apos;t kill language .
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We really should not kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to know for ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And this is a great deal of the opportunity to create novel and religion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls who were already in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; Kal &quot; &quot; photos of boys and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used the English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; school &quot; &quot; down , they want to make a double down , but I have to say a word that &apos;s pretty good and equality .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not , we don &apos;t have to educate ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to convince each and every one of us that we will not allow anyone to open up or think that we have the capacity to control our language , to press us , to press us , to patch our patients and to think .
Our idea has to be creative .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or refine the rocket , we can be creative again .
At the moment , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start with that day .
They post a nano or a short film .
Once again , we get a global scale .
She can re-inflate the Arabic language onto the front page .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there is no solution ; there is a solution !
But we have to know , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , part of the solution .
proud , what can you do today ?
Who here are you tweeting ?
In compassion , I challenge you , even though my time is up , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic text message , doesn &apos;t write Arabic .
( Applause ) It &apos;s exhausting ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more work .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the preservation of this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child is providing a language for the first time with her dad knowing .
When my daughter was born , I can &apos;t tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , ya . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I recruited my daughter from the light of the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom , &quot; &quot; won &apos;t call me .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anybody to hear that . ( Applause ) So you get a little bit of this culture of humiliation . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that we remember the deepest sense that our presence is not a secret , that my presence is not a secret at the negative habits that are protecting my people , until you saw me and you saw me from the bank , and we were missing a generation of inequality , and we were missing this generation of inequality , and we were missing a generation when it comes to
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , my primary career was a corporate culture , which meant I had to write more material .
Now an average person , when they write something , will have something to do with it .
You know , you guys know — ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll probably start working very slowly , but in the first week , you do a lot more work and the more work later , everything &apos;s done , it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be everything , but actually the script is going to get at the head , and then I &apos;m going to do something like that .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens to every writer .
And then comes the new paper , the paper that you do in a year .
And I knew that my common sense wasn &apos;t good enough .
It was a very big task .
I plan , and I decided that I would do something like this .
It &apos;ll look something like this this this this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of a work , in the meanwhile , I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a trick .
How hard is learning going to be ?
That &apos;s not a big deal , right ?
And then there was this funny thing .
How about a few months ?
Go and go , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a magnificent project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then she would be dead , and I hadn &apos;t written anything , and we were just there .
And two weeks went by , which was two weeks .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in the World Wide Web , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote 90 pages , two pages , and I left them together , and they didn &apos;t have to go on two streets — two streets of the Humans — two streets filled with each other , spending time in the classroom , and I
I thought , this is it .
I got a call one week later from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you want to be Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , this is great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was a huge believer . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is surprising . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very good .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
Several years ago I started writing about lists .
My crowd would always give me six people a hug and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that the brain tumor made a difference between six people .
Find out , I made a leaf where I studied two brains of either brain and stroke , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so obvious , but consider it .
So here &apos;s a six person in the brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
In both of these brains , there &apos;s a decade ahead , but the rest of the brain has a kind of fun to make .
Now , what does this mean in a test tube ?
It means it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Workforce is the best time to work . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &quot; &quot; &#93; The smart guy will make a decision to make sense of what that means , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he picks up the book , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Tennis and Twain Harry , because I know it &apos;s happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;ll go to the next level , and see , in 10 minutes , something new emerged ?
After that , you &apos;ll see YouTube , beginning with a conversation about the race of the Richard Fund , and soon after it &apos;s over to watch the TEDWomen &apos;s Mother .
( Laughter ) It &apos;ll take a while for all of those things , so it doesn &apos;t take much time to do anything else today .
Hold tight ! ( SM : Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the foundation of compassion that you want to call .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It understands the unimaginable future , but it &apos;s only about two things : compassion and mercy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all well .
If you do , and you spend your whole life getting fun and hard , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make this , we are a generation of animals .
Great food , good sleep , and a generation from now , maybe that &apos;s what happens in the past .
But if you didn &apos;t pay attention , it &apos;s not too far off .
We are a growing civilization , and we don &apos;t even know it .
That &apos;s why we have another person in our brain who &apos;s deciding whether or not we &apos;re deciding in our brains , who &apos;s able to do things that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are lonely .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And it &apos;s only with us that she wants to be as happy as we are .
Sometimes it seems just the right thing to do , which is easier and more emotional to enjoy food , sleep or opportunity in moments .
That &apos;s why we have a disease .
Sometimes they agree .
And sometimes it seems counter-intuitive to do what &apos;s hard to do , for a major purpose .
And this is the planet Jump .
And for the strongest people , this contradiction always reveals the end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet , easy and meaningful path that &apos;s outside the circle .
I call it a weird place .
( Laughter ) Dark Grounds is the place where the Serious people are very well known .
There &apos;s an age when distraction is not supposed to be dominated .
In a dark field that shows you that this is actually not a hostility , because it &apos;s not your fault , the sense of enthusiasm , of fear , of insecurity , of your own hatred — all the properties that go along in the right track .
The question is , in this way , when the source is listed , how do we get people to step into the channel , which is a very unfortunate but important place ?
It turns out that hundreds of people are also conservationists , who are always preserving it at these very specific times — anyone called Dutch .
( Laughter ) Now , it &apos;s a house that &apos;s mostly sweeping the most , but when it &apos;s closer to home , it &apos;s fine , or it &apos;s at the time when people are threatened by embarrassment , jobs or scary results .
And the important thing is that the building is just that .
Now , I had this connection with my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and gave me the TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
My dream was to join TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my joy and anger , something else was happening in the brain of making decisions long .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to be like in the future ?
We should start now . The publisher says , &quot; &quot; Yes , I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you go on Google and look at the map of India below 20,000 feet , and we &apos;ll just break it until we see all over India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided to celebrate their names .
I downloaded the web and had a picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) Houses that were over-managed , and within seconds the entire system was determined to be depressed . ( Laughter )
And remember , in the winter — he &apos;s scared of the house — he just rolls down the tree !
And finally , and finally , long-term decision-makers get together and I can start talking .
Now , the homework assignment that talks about every form of a puzzle , someone like me will charge someone like me for two weeks , and the beginning of a value assignment is not going to be written , and then , amazingly , the unbelievable contribution to perform is to go all night and write .
And the Take the Fizzy Cola Bottle , in this case , is the system of the Sistine people .
It &apos;s very good , so neither can be done .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
When I wrote this , it surprised me with the influence on it .
I &apos;ve actually received thousands of miles from around the world and from people , from all walks of life , from all walks of life .
They included nurses , bankers , engineers , peters and CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them said one thing and wrote : &quot; I am in conflict with this issue too . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of interviews I got from email and email address .
In the script of these people , I was lying in the mainstream script , and they wrote about how much SOLEs spent on these lives , in terms of what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system &apos;s the right way , what &apos;s the next ?
Why are all of these people in the dark ?
Well , it turns out there are two parts of the list .
I gave you today four examples , talking about issues , all of them online .
And when the data is online , the effects of the paper are deadly because the household hold is deadly .
But there &apos;s a second kind of cylinder on the list , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data online .
So if you want a project that starts itself , like some kind of arts or businesses — some kind of arts or businesses , as long as you don &apos;t start paying attention to getting faster , to keep doing things .
There are also many other things besides jobs that you can &apos;t connect with , like getting to work with your family , exercise , find your health , find your relationships , tell your relationships better and tell your relationships that you can &apos;t hear .
Now , if the only way the SOLEs work is because it &apos;s hard , because all of the data that &apos;s created in the context of a house is lost .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The good news is that you can &apos;t send them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s the kind of permanent magic that comes out of the picture much less and is much less talked about than the stereotypical mystery , the perversion of the serious literature .
You are pathologically held .
And this can be driven by the longer term pain and the longer term .
So I thought that was because of their email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban death system has opened them , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot fulfill their dreams , which is that they cannot even combine them .
I read all of the email and it said one thing : I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think all of you are Scriptures .
You may not be a very complex situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) and some of you may have had good relationships with the web , but remember the keyboards when there &apos;s no Death Valley .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the career of life .
Every block means a week , it &apos;s the new year .
These aren &apos;t very many boxes , especially when some of them are executive .
I think we all need to be included in this Canada .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing next , because in every life there &apos;s no time .
We need to be careful with the invention of compassion .
It is crucial to all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that home , and perhaps we should start by doing that .
Perhaps not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know what .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eight days of the United States and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan was lifting up from a region of Afghanistan , deploying a region away from Afghanistan to help a government office to protect Afghanistan so that they can help them build a government office to protect the jobs of the Afghan government so that they can protect a government office to help them save the jobs of the Afghan State
She arrived at the height of an assault and she was surrounded by three other things , and with a lot of things , she watched as a child drove the Copenhagen Ventine , and she watched as young as a tramp to save the dams and save the deaths .
One of the people who lived there , one of the people who lived there , one of the men and one of the men in Spanish , was heading up one of the Jewish teachers , and he was also heading towards one of the Jewish teachers .
This is shown in the White House , and this crossword puzzle , it carries a little bit of the crossword puzzle as it spins around the globe .
They put it into the Hole in the Wall computers , and then you notice that captain was sticking out and throwing it at you before they could rescue others .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are very deep emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why it was I work with people that didn &apos;t .
You know , you go to the fusions and the people who are yearning to experience yourself in order to benefit others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are desperate to experience others in a way that benefits us .
We have an electrical calculus !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they go to the forest .
These people are looking for the purpose of services , for the better people , to this vision of services .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is happening in the environment , and if you have the right environment , each and every one of us has the capacity to work together , then each and every one of us has the capacity to work together and build on that and build on that capacity for others to do that .
I &apos;m going to have the privilege of meeting with some of the people that we &apos;ve asked yesterday — my mother — and I &apos;m going to have the privilege of meeting with some of the people that we &apos;ve asked yesterday — who took your skills and put them at risk to rescue others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a profound sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not victims .
You can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; rescue me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It may not be that I give two people the chance to collaborate , and that &apos;s what they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this leave us ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , at the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of threats , all of these threats , we have a very strong focus for ourselves .
There &apos;s no private thing .
Dream can be a lack of resources , but it &apos;s a long-term TEDster that &apos;s working together to mitigate the longer lifespan of everything that &apos;s working together to mitigate our life .
And so that &apos;s why we &apos;re ready as social animals , where we come together and we work together as a part of this sacrifice , as in a tribe where we feel our own personal connection .
And when we felt really safe to ourselves , we were both broadband and collaboration .
It has a constant benefit .
It means I can sleep every night and I can swim and see some of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , that means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s the system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world that &apos;s threatened with things that are struggling to make our lives difficult or trying to shrink our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
It can also lead society to a very high degree of poverty in the stock market .
It could be a new technology that you can take out your business class and drop it in the night , it could be a new technology that will take your business class and drop it in the night .
Or you could fight , or you could fight , sometimes trying to kill you .
It &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s driving your development and trying to drive your businesses to drive your development , and it &apos;s trying to drive your development and your businesses to drive you out .
We have no control over these powers .
It &apos;s an infinite thing , and it &apos;s never done .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where the intensity of work is because it believes the direction that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the people in her organization and their lives that are supposed to protect the people in her organization and in their lives , it is that they sacrifice their role and benevolence in order for people to stay alive , and it is that they sacrifice their role and that they sacrifice results so that people can be safe and feel their own personal relations , they can sacrifice
I was on a venture journey , and I noticed an occurrence that when a traveler attempted to enter the room before he was picked up and I saw the staff on the doorway that they could come to him in the same way that he had pushed the law as he did to me .
Once upon a time , I tried to step on it , the first time I tried to step on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep cutting things like that ?
Why can &apos;t you keep robbing people like us ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer back then .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we enjoy traveling to the West Virginia is not because they &apos;re attracted to the Lamanic people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from each other and we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and therefore less organization .
What a great leader can show to him is that as a parent , as a great leader , I can show him the best example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent looks like , what would you like ? What is it made of ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our kids the opportunity , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our kids the opportunity , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the tools to grow and to do more of what we can do for ourselves to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people the opportunities , education , discipline , when necessity , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , discipline , when necessary , and they want to give them the opportunity to create self-confidence , access and disability so that they can achieve more achieve what we &apos;ve never imagined before so that they can achieve more advances than ever imagined .
Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the head of a tech company called Next Jump in New York City , is CEO of a technology company called Next Jump in New York City , and they say , if your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever bring out your kid ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has undertaken the workforce of prostitution , and Charley has undertaken the workforce .
If you &apos;re a Next Jump employee , you don &apos;t get to work on the basis of efficiency .
Instead , if you have a problem , they &apos;ll mentor you and help you , in the same way that we would , for every kid who comes to home from school and go to Congress .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so upsetting and angry , some of the bankers who are staying with the CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so upsetting and so anxious , some of the bankers from the CEO , that so many people are so upset and so anxious , some of the bankers are staying with the CEO , who are unequally upsetting and caring .
It &apos;s not about data .
They &apos;ve mastered the fundamental principle of creativity .
They have established a profound social society .
We know that they &apos;ve gone through their well-being because they &apos;ve been tested by their people , we know that they &apos;ve gone through their well-being because of their well-being , but they &apos;ve also told them that they have honored their well-being because of their backgrounds , rather than saying that they &apos;ve saved their well-being because of saving their people .
It &apos;s something that compares us to data , not data .
Could anybody guess that it &apos;s okay to give you a $ 150 million piece of software ?
Why didn &apos;t we give bonuses 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with it ? Absolutely not .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to protect the data .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to protect the data .
Instead , they &apos;re going to give people shorter data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people shorter data to save .
In the Budapest Chambers , they run a mining company in the Boston Mass Media called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who became the big business , and they built their own 30 percent of the caregivers in the night .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they rarely overestimate their own benefits .
They needed a $ 10 million children , so many of the companies that now have accumulated the board people and did the right thing .
And Bob turns it on .
You see , the bus is not believing in the bus fare .
It &apos;s more difficult to lower your heart , your heart rate , your heart rate , and it &apos;s harder to lower your heart .
And they built a personal program .
that every official , from the Scripture to the CEO , needs to put everyone in a small four-week vacation .
They could never do it when they wanted it and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob published the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said that it &apos;s better for all of us to suffer a little bit of pain than for some of us to suffer a lot of damage and a lot of stress .
So they have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel confident and cooperate in an organization .
And basically , as nobody expected , people started to trade each other .
The ones that were most successful did work with less successful people .
So some took five weeks to get somebody to participate in just three weeks .
Jihad is an extreme , not lunch .
I know so many people who benefit from organizations &apos;s leadership skills , I know so many people who benefit from organizations that are at least not leaders .
They &apos;re perfect corporators , and we do what they say because we get them to control us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know so many people across the board of organizations that don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re a real leader , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the person on the left , and they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about a number of scientists who were out in the outhouse and how philanthropy is the way the soldier eats honey and he feeds his men first , and when he eats , he eats nothing for him .
And when he came back into the field , his men gave her some of their food to eat because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We call them the leaders .
We call them leaders because they take risks first , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims and they choose to be preserved , and then , when we do that , natural responsibility is for our people to sacrifice .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their facial blood and blood to see what their leader &apos;s aspiration is to become real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and pneumonia to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this to us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t this organization that we all want to work with ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all want to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little bit of the story of the Limpopo , which happens to be the winner of the Limpopo and the Mumbai .
Where water and electricity are really unbelievable as an amusement , and growing in these conditions is really hard to get at the age of 17 , at the age of 17 , I was staying with friends in the urban slums in the bush .
The sun is heating up in the winter .
And as I was filling out the door , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you create something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t have to be touched ? &quot; &quot; So I sat down and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought it . &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did some research and I found some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-four million of them are in Africa , and they &apos;re only in South Africa .
Different diseases accumulate in the environment , and one of the most dangerous things is called atrazine .
One of the things that happens with the lack of the eye is the fact that you can be directed directly by being more than one of the most selective anti-smoking ads .
This disease is inspired by millions of people every single year by continuous incarceration , and one of the most scary things about childhood trauma is that you only have to give up on your own : no choice , no tools , no engineering .
After looking at the statistics of Afghanistan , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t just do this for myself and not just want to deal with it , but I do this work at least because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then , I ran out of my strength of 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have any Internet , I went on Google and did some research on Wikipedia
And I looked at it like a really interesting problem .
So the Mayans are right , our formula has been set .
Now we need to be careful .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on my phone , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the youngest patent holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; now and Miss ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , a worldwide exchange for the world &apos;s first slogan .
You just keep it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to be careful .
( Laughter ) So after trying to make it efficient in high school and confined resources , which I had , the Health Media Collaboratory engaged some new people , did it any longer , and now we have a full-term impact , which is ready for the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercials and people .
What we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They just buy the names they need . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; they buy a ticket every day because that &apos;s how much money they need .
So we built DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just put it in and let it go .
And the cool thing about it is that a simple replacement of a meat is only in five corners .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about industry conservation .
We even want DriBath the rich guys who came to us there . ( Laughter ) Once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water on the average when they leave and we could save two houses for children who live in the same neighborhood , two hours more for a school , two more homes for a school , two more homes for the kid .
After looking at global impacts , we &apos;ve taken this down to our core values , our security and our service .
DriBath is the service of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
So now we &apos;re entering a market mechanism , where we &apos;re actually going into a market mechanism , which can be put into a retailing market , and one question for my listeners today , at the Limpopo Club , we &apos;re actually going to launch a weekend with 50 pages of an analysis that doesn &apos;t have to be monitored by the world .
What &apos;s up to you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that , I haven &apos;t done that .
And more importantly , I learned a lot in the course of this whole process , Google announced me , as the world &apos;s first teenagers .
I &apos;m one of the best undergraduates in the world right now , the first African that &apos;s been given this academic , and one of the things that surprised me most is why I didn &apos;t want to go blaming for this . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m here today to offer you some of the results that may surprise you and may be surprised by what the leading causes of success in organizations are because of , in fact , fundamental success .
I believe that donor agencies are a fantastic tool to create a better place in the world .
If you select a group of people with the desire to equality waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find all the human capabilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is the majority of them going to fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success in the first place .
I wanted to be very organized about this , pushing myself from many of my misconceptions and misconceptions that had led me to some of the organizations in the last few years .
I wanted to know this because I was beginning a different business at the age of 12 , going to Hyderabad High School , going to school , building solar power tools , then going to college , when I made a low-friction video .
I graduated from College , and I started a foundation for a software company .
And 20 years ago , started in the League of India , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve run more than 100 companies , and we &apos;ve run a lot of big breakthroughs .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to look at these components as the leading cause of organization success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there is something here .
That &apos;s why I put my company &apos;s name Libra , the old moment you feel about it .
So with that in mind , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to check or collapse , are even more critical factors .
I &apos;d never thought that I &apos;d be speaking here at TED last summer , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , until I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It is critical to the ability to reach the head of a team towards improvement .
Cookie is an honest truth .
So I thought that maybe the team was the most important thing .
So I started to look at the business model .
Is an organization that is doing a blind job ?
With that in mind , it seemed to me that this was the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
After this , of course — is it time ?
The idea came very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t set for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;re going to come in and learn the world ?
Is this true ?
Or was it too late , and already far more violent ?
So I &apos;ve gone through a lot of respect for these five things in many of the institutions .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in the Libya , and 100 of them from the outside to attempt to find a scientific result .
So first of these ideas , first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of revenue .
And the bottom five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — did not make a difference .
So I tried to look at all the characteristics , as I think they had made progress in these places .
So I went to visit strange breakthroughs like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a high investment in the low-friction companies , and they were always the business model , but they weren &apos;t able to be successful .
I tried to learn that the majority of those factors had the highest impact on the success and the failure of all those companies , and the result surprised me .
The first was the choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent is in the gap between success and failure .
The team and the organization is on the other hand , and then , thinking , having different ideas , remoteness , is actually number three .
But in fact , it &apos;s not true that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and thinking it , I was surprised that belief isn &apos;t the most important thing .
Sometimes it matters a lot more when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my understanding .
I think that market model is still very boring , because you can do it without a market model , and then you can do it with a capital P.
And investment , if initially low investment , but now it &apos;s increasing , particularly now , is very easy to get investment .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples from all of these notes .
Take the big Airbnb , as you all know .
Many of the investors in this company had noticed because people thought , well , who &apos;s going to put any of your household chores into a ticket ?
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of compassion is because of the best market model , the workforce , and the workforce , is because of the right time .
This company came in confronted with financial difficulties when people needed additional support , and this was certainly helping people respond to the atrocities that they need at home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
But , time was everything right to make the drivers of their need .
The drivers were too expensive ; they were too expensive .
Some things , like Citysearch arrived at the time when people needed a page .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 here at TED , reported that companies wanted to outperform their grandparents more .
We thought the best of times , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so excited to do it — so with a lot of collaborators and a wonderful business model , we had to work with the great Hole in the Wall .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband Internet was much lower .
It was really hard to watch the online video , you didn &apos;t have to know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of coding and dumped more than 50 percent of the broadband in the United States , YouTube arrived at the best of times .
Great , good time .
As it turns out , YouTube was no commercial model .
They weren &apos;t even sure it was going to work .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
Idea is critical .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they really are ready to check you .
And it &apos;s absolutely true that what happens is the outcome is not made up of these , because if you like , you want to keep it going , but you have to work with it in the time frame .
As we &apos;ve said , early organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them are helpful towards increasing your success , and then bringing the world to some of the best places .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 April 3 , 2016 we saw the biggest data point in history . &#93; &#91; French accents painted rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; classified small amounts of money into small companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Route of the Gulf Ventures to make the diagnosis . &#93; &#91; This week , we were at the center of a campaign of storyt@@
Since then , almost all of these papers have been published to cover small pieces of hidden shell companies .
We get to know the inner stories of the cow , the bankers and the inner city , and we say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a home company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; So you can actually see , if you can actually see a text message exchange , you can see a way of doing it , how they do it , how they do it .
The effects of this have just started to show up .
The President of Ashley has been hijacked .
We also heard the news that middle-aged doctors are descending companies like Al-Qaeda .
The employment of two billion dollars goes to the head of the Ross Council , the head of the Ross Council , with his childhood friend , the head of the line .
And many rich people will be infected , and those who are too afraid to tell the stories are going to go home .
Now that sounds like a magic trick or a violin story with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that energizing and empowering people are stepping up their wallet and not giving as much status as they should , means that successful actions like teachers get paid less for health and education .
And this affects all of us .
My organization for Galapagos Venture , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people put their influence in the weekend companies that we &apos;ve been talking about for decades .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how brown companies work .
I think it &apos;s like a road map .
You can log in to another company within a company , a company inside that has pretty much no idea who &apos;s behind it .
Companies with law enforcement , press , school is hard to understand what &apos;s happening .
I think this is particularly interesting in the U.S. , not very much on this .
Maybe it &apos;s because the major American population doesn &apos;t have to be on that scale .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no rich people in America who are not investing in dirty companies .
That &apos;s why the road companies work , there are a few in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we read the novelty of Kim Illind or Dallel Viewers or Huxley or Nepheus , the ones that are connected to America .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give us this much information , you need less information to get your company out of the Libra card .
This kind of information is sent to U.S. schools .
That puts the nine billion dollars into balance .
This kind of behavior affects all of us .
Now in the Galapagos Ventures , we wanted to look at how this affects people .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we hooked up a campaign to run the 13 government companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transfer to the homeless America , a home , a ship and a space .
What was really striking was that all of the villages had provided a one-size-fits-all approach to how to move their teeth .
These were all early meetings , and we had no money for it , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone , but this disrupted the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not treated as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about the individual voice that talked about in our quiet endeavor and our proposal .
It &apos;s not just about a scientist who &apos;s been trained in school .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , that the Texas can , the television , the poverty , the underemployment .
And in order to have that , we have to change the game .
We have to change the rules of the game so that it can be daunting in this way .
It can be ironic , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think there &apos;s something going to change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been stepping towards transparency where the company has been holding out .
This issue was put on a political agenda , but the British Prime Minister of Division divided campaigns at 8 o &apos;clock in the southern ridge in 2013 .
And Europe has been building upon the time a national mainstream , whether it &apos;s actually a European country or is controlling them .
The clear thing is that the I.S. is behind it .
Communication on a planet with explicit laws in the center and the Senate , whose development we wanted was not making that progress , so we were five .
We want to look at inventions , the root appliances , that are used throughout the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in Galapagos .
We need to reach the source of distraction for those who know their knowledge behind barbed wire factories .
Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , we get this .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to lobby for legitimate changes in access to information .
And together , we can destroy this privacy secret that is responsible for the cutting and the calling edge of taxation .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Locke , who &apos;s your invention , has had a very high impact over the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , could it be true ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a controversy — isn &apos;t it ? — that global media is showing us that worldwide is incredibly bad at publishing a small group of employees at least one small group of data that is far more than all the media in the world .
CA : What &apos;s that story ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you stay ahead of them ?
Julie Singer : There we are . I can say it to you — public services are in the right way . And we have so many ways that they can get the information to us .
Therefore , we use a very high lattice cap to essentially transmit materials from one place to the Internet , to clear away the sign for legal contracts like Sweden and Bill .
We get the information that &apos;s accessible , through regular DOT , through Ramadan , or whatever , to organizations like the regular news organizations , form platforms — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about mass input to give mass information to people and then protect yourself against the negative and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you actually never know what the tool is .
Julie Singer : It &apos;s true , we &apos;ll never know it anywhere . And if we get there at any given time , we &apos;ll soon be able to miss the information .
( Cheering ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s a good idea , and you &apos;re asking what the code is , the TED Talk . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s take an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you invented a few years ago .
If we could zoom into this .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you initiated and what happened next ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s her report .
It was a secret psychological report that the government of Kenya prepared for its 2004 elections .
Before 2004 , the government was down there for 18 years .
He was an ambulance in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the box — these were the primary attributes that were trying to figure out how to fix it , they put it into 20 million pounds of report , similar kinds of reports .
And then the government was sitting at it and using it for its political will , which was the wealthiest man — now is the wealthiest person in Kenya .
That &apos;s Jesus Christ for the Kenyan press .
That &apos;s why it was made in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish it with the winning elections , first of September 2008 , of the elections .
When we did that report , three days after we gave her the new president , Kabul decided to become a friend from the person who she was murdered , Daniel Arabha , so she turned it into a report in the shadows of Cairo .
CA : And — so I mean , just to put it very briefly — it was spread in Kenya , not from the private sector , but from the media , and from your party , it changed the result .
Julin Sung : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafi and then it spread across the entire continent of Kenya and Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , a few days later , gave the Canadian press audience the confidence that they could talk about it .
And that blog was released on the TV 20 days of January , and it changed the equation 10 percent of the Violence Against Women Act in Kenya , and it changed the result of elections .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your secret agenda has changed the world ?
Julie Singer : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Here . We &apos;re going to show you a little demo of a little demo of this device .
This video is live but here &apos;s a little clip of something .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-speed video .
Radio : ... it was cooler , when you reached them and you blew them .
I &apos;ve seen , oh , there are four things .
The way is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , let me tell you . Go away .
Hello everyone .
Go ! Go !
( Machine sound ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Machine sound ) Gulf is running .
Hatel — two engineers , two great teachers .
We should now walk , time is up !
Okay , now we killed eight people .
We &apos;re looking at two old Ukrainian cafeteria , and we &apos;re still carrying grubs .
Rather , they &apos;re on my credit .
Two , it &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hebrew . Okay . Yeah , I beat them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julie Sung : People who worked on it had a very big impact on it .
We ended up doing a study with two people getting distracted .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
CA : So there were 11 people who died in that , all right ?
Julie Singer : Yes ! Two employees in the rivets , two small children were killed .
In total , from 18 to 26 people died .
CA : And there was a lot more leaning in with him .
What was the primary cause of harm , you think ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see , in terms of their potential level of inequality .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the street , and then from a kilometer away , the U.S. Capitol begins to scratch the surface of 30 miles of electricity — each one of them — and kill the waves by the children .
There were two journalists who were no longer paper , because they were professionals .
CA : The United States Department of Divine Mansion was arrested , and it &apos;s said that he announced in Chester Rome that he had made this video for you , 280,000 and a half American documentaries as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Singer : So we decided to accept the document .
It was thought that five days ago , 150,000 papers were made and 50 .
But we &apos;ve gone back to doing that in the beginning of the year in Rajasthan and an American factory , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to go to this safari room .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of advertisements from the American safari family ...
Julie Singer : We &apos;ll follow them . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do it ? ) Julie Singer : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julie Singer : Because things like this show that what &apos;s really happening here is , for example , in Arabic governments , are violating human rights violations in these governments .
If you look at available evidence of this kind of material , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Let &apos;s just play with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you replicate hidden information ?
Julie Singer : Yes , the question is how important information the world is , what data can be made possible .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
They spend a lot of money putting a lot of money to keep an organization secure , and that &apos;s a great sign that when you need to get the information out , you hope to do something good , because the organizations know it better , and they know it , and they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of press .
CA : But are there risks to it personally or collectively , which lead to unexpected values ?
Julie Singer : We didn &apos;t share what we were seeing with them .
I mean , our grand challenge is action .
With information , we can extract information in a very specific way that is identified — contains information that is identified by someone .
But there are also some mysteries . For example , your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about civic goods that come in and watch out for youth .
CA : Well , they &apos;ve been able to do it vigorously .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , of a parent who is a son of America who is a daughter , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something that some people like to hug other people .
One of the things that consists of this in America is that there &apos;s a philosophy of the dead .
Which has an impact — it has millions of people worldwide who are Japanese .
Although they &apos;re not , my son is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Singer : Let &apos;s start with many of those questions .
But remember in the abaya , in Iraq , in Afghanistan — people don &apos;t have to watch a video , they look at it every day .
That doesn &apos;t make a difference in their behavior , it doesn &apos;t make a difference in their behavior .
Because they look at it every day .
It will change their mind and their thinking about why they pay all this money , and this is our hope .
CA : OK , so you look really hopefully at what you think companies and governments are holding information for .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous if you wanted to have these glowing lights , you needed to be able to maintain privacy in your own culture ?
Julie Singer : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not all different cells .
We don &apos;t have the media that is surrounded by other minds .
If they do this , it &apos;ll be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it this way that people are ethically comfortable with being honest about whether they do this work or not .
CA : I certainly think we &apos;ve all heard a lot about this — this is to get used to the oppressed .
You may also have noticed that there will be different breakthroughs about the lions and the lions .
One is the hero of hope .
Or trouble .
What does the hero look like ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Singer : Oh ! There &apos;s something going on .
CA : These are very good people , Julie , very good .
We have to try and do it . Let me give you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done before , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
Now this is a really fun story , right ?
What is this ?
Julie Singer : This is a sample of what we do every day .
Last year at the end of the year — in November , there was a massive leak in the bananas , as was happening in Mexico , but not so big .
And we got the Report Mile — which was a very nice experiment about it — when it was said that they had actually counted different conservation companies and put them there and plucked them up .
And it included the Soviet government and so forth .
And there was nothing on that report . That &apos;s why we had a very difficult time .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , might this company have done all this competitive ?
That &apos;s the foundation we put it together , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it looks good to see , but we can &apos;t imagine it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter that week after he wrote this , and they wanted to take out the tool . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to use the tool . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show paper that you actually owned it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they took this lead that we see on Scripture with the name of the microflute player with the DNA of the DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s what &apos;s happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of validating and judging what the material is , and trying to write and get the letter from these people .
CA : All right . So how long do we get this information from the inside of your bone ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have a lot , I mean , at the moment , we &apos;re accumulating and rewarding actions like difficult moments .
Our application for publishing this has been clear for several months because we &apos;re restoring our own food system because of the rare public waste that we have .
This is a spray .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s flowing forward , our ability is decoupled more than we are because of our growth , and this means that we have a vast amount of social services that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have as many people to be able to modify and to anticipate this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the essential problem , essentially , why was it invented by journalists or journalists ?
Julie Sung : Yes . And brilliant people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to follow , because with the material that &apos;s accessible to us , we need to network and network that &apos;s accessible to people that have a very high degree of sense of local conservation , and then have a very low sense of what &apos;s happening .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re going to tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is this true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , my parents were in the business of films and then ran away from the city , so it had an impact on both of these things .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychologist , so what I &apos;m saying is , by the way , everything can be driven by a mental illness .
Julie Singer : What , what about movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a little nerd and you just took a look at the initiative .
Julie Singer : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist , a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I told the girl at the time when I was terminally ill .
To do that , you need to take the word and appreciate it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Rockefeller that &apos;s using the Rockefeller model to cover your grandmother &apos;s banking .
To do that , this word is no longer useful as it was before .
CA : Well , yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a parent &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your core values ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps one event in your life that has helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in facts .
But the basic values : good , enabled people don &apos;t create mainstream ; they prepare them .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some other brilliant , aggressive people who are in my life .
CA : And brilliant and healthy people don &apos;t generate vaccines , do they generate ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a leather man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there is another way to reproduce the monkey , which is approaching the police with a crime .
And this is something that has been in my community for a very long time .
CA : So let &apos;s just tell us , very quickly , what happened in the last few years ?
Basically , you published something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you dropped the newspaper with the bullying out of your story .
Instead , they showed you your situation .
That gave you a sense of what happened in Ice Linda . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ice Linda was in crisis .
He was the most powerful of all .
The banking community here has gone up 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the National Taliban had a very controversial event five minutes before it was released , as a movie : &quot; The prohibitious anti-smoking movie arrived at Discovery Channel , and the state of Newfoundland was saying , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed up the website , time-consuming all the time , and we became very popular in the Ice Lands , and I went to Ice Land and talked about this issue .
And the checks for the people there that shouldn &apos;t be this way again , and as a result , as a result , from the Six Lands , working with some international experts , we devised a new kind of Asian Linda Law , which is a kind of liberal media landscape , one of the most protective sites for journalists all over the world , bringing about new Nobel Prize winners .
A country like Ice Land the Netherlands , which means that it &apos;s headed up from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Alliance Party reported this properly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are you looking to us at greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not quite sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure for the laws of free demand and and the laws of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in the U.S. , in the U.S.
What is it going to take ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because from a small attempt , we can move it to one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m kind of reforting the audience with what they call the Joann , with respect , and all this power to you .
Julie Sung : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I was a kid .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like to play and watch .
So I did this , which is milk .
I used to check my kid &apos;s wings in the boxes of Connecticut , and I would see him wrinkle in the branches .
When I was growing up and going back home in the early &apos; 90s , I got this .
My team was shocked .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , it suddenly occurred to me how the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to church mines everywhere I go — you know , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in London , there were four species repeated on the glacier ice in New Delhi — that were cold , dark , silver and code .
And I thought that was kind of weird , and I was wondering whether anyone would ever have this Scottish disturbance .
And when I took the leave , it occurred to me that people were not looking at the careers .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Continuing the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human quality .
We did that 10 thousand years ago when we first came out of our caves .
If you look at the oil spills 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll notice they &apos;re rooted and thin , you &apos;ll see all the creatures you see there .
But if you look back to the year 2000 , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cars , cows , bricks and stars .
It &apos;s also true of the prophets .
You look at mine 150 years ago , or 200 years ago in New York City , you look at pictures and piles of humpbacks and squirrels .
But if you look at the remoteness of the present , you &apos;re going to be left with just four colors — the third , the ruler , but also the ruler .
It understands that we &apos;re moving toward this .
How did that happen to us ?
Seriously .
It &apos;s a brand new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
World War II gave us the greatest inspiration to become heroes .
In the midst of the great war , we developed technologies like SOLEs , Hadron Collider and all of these things .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have seen the dramatic increase in the ability to go to months .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soil farm and the sea farm has gone up , and in the last two years , its origins have gone up from this collective moisture .
Now if you collect the forest flows and the forest flows , it will be equal to the two Chinese that are born every year from the sea .
Using my Chinese countertopic is not a contradiction , because China is not only the largest country , it is also the largest border .
Now let &apos;s turn to our four choices .
The first is the major culprits in the U.S. and the West .
Obesity is a critical source .
All you need is a single footprint that kills five , 10 , or 15 pounds-worth of forest gains to the market .
Now , the Indus tradeoff is also unbelievably honest .
In a study done in a clinical study done by Delhi University , it showed that dealing with household humidity is a particularly ineffective use of carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That whose fate is still in the forest areas are the Mongolian areas .
Let &apos;s see these beautiful images .
They put the Earth &apos;s footprint in their place , protecting the beaches , cleaning and cleaning the beaches , giving all that sort of important stuff to the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the management wars .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years alone putting out millions of icons .
A second process that &apos;s going on here , that &apos;s what the philanthropist Mark Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve just seen a little bit of the Tropical River , which is very controversial .
What &apos;s happening today is that the retina is headed up from the nose , but with it , with very large amounts of other mosquitos to infect and change them into old food .
And a lot of times , we get to work with the slums that we call the &quot; &quot; Redemption . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the mosquito that we &apos;d like to see on the river , which means that the ecosystem is turning into fat , which means that the ecosystem is growing and slaughtering itself .
Later on , there &apos;s a second largest food diet in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You need to look at large areas of the world to organize like tuna .
We also have a region called the ICCAT , or the ICCAT , for the Internet Conservation for Domestic Violence .
Carl Simpson also considered the great adventure of reading all technology .
We can stand for the long term , but it &apos;s not good for the long term .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tattoos get warm .
She earns over 40 miles of vacant lots and can supply her body temperature to over 20 degrees Celsius .
The net charge on fish is almost done .
The frame is shadowy with blood vessels that don &apos;t flow very long .
This is great for proteins .
But those forest creatures that are 40 miles away from home calculations are not able to stay in the forest .
Same thing is torn up ; it doesn &apos;t have to be torn up by a decade ahead .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was a warming trip .
If you had a chart of a connectome , every data is a document .
In the politics of Connect , there are over 3,000 of them .
Actually , I &apos;m just saying people are more connected — ( Laughter ) if anyone is empowering the power of connect , then I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere there are those rocks that propel the rule of ladies to children in peace .
As a result , we have a successful breakthrough for our ranks and for the community .
When the shaming started , Sami was killing six pounds of forest furniture to make a stand .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
Instead , what we find is a little bit of a mistake , because if you look at the Freedom of Information , they name the Same Street for a piece of software .
While this is a TEDPED player .
It &apos;s hard to say something about chocolate and chocolate .
But then the whole market mechanisms suggest that it has become a subsidizing of the replacement capital market .
This is a system that produces exoteric electricity , which is a continuous flow of the Earth .
This is seven percent per year .
Even though we spend a little bit less money putting into the market , we &apos;re also spending a lot more money .
We don &apos;t just play chickens , we just play chickens and squirrels .
We have what &apos;s left over , what &apos;s left , what &apos;s left , what &apos;s left .
Because you put blood and blood on top of it and so on and so forth , and you put the birch .
I was also surprised by the mosquitos who beat her , but the mosquitos burned her .
India is the first or the first one . ( Laughter ) And as a result , this is a terrible problem .
We &apos;ve been talking about 30 million tons of desalination plants for 20 years that are being taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third piece of China , or the entire U.S. , that &apos;s getting out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia literally started as lions .
And it started to look like a local entrepreneur who had seen that the next day he would never go to a McDonald &apos;s store .
He grabbed his hand and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
For the ocean , for the most part , it was only proven that it was not harmless .
So he built his lifetime synthesis .
Unfortunately , the pension was in 30 seconds .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter Code .
Mexico &apos;s largest industry of art in the United States is deployed every year by two to three billion pounds of leather .
If we stop the police , maybe the alternative would be tripled .
Twenty years ago , Taliban didn &apos;t know anything .
This shifts the plant proteins in a very dynamic way , and this is the third world for me .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution that &apos;s being adult in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like an inverted bracket .
It doesn &apos;t include the ACEs and the ADHD that we think will be keeping us alive all the time .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That &apos;s a large sample of about 30 million tons .
One possibility that conservationists have proposed is , can we eat it ?
Can we find a way to give it to peers instead of ?
There are reasons for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the market of India against lying , and the average elite in the fight against lying , and the influence on the ranch of the Indus people .
This is Okapi 3 , EPA and CDC .
So here &apos;s her potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of just paying a few dollars a pound or a PCs and turning it into a foot , we could crowdsource the leather and give the monkeys more money to pay the goods that they need ?
The second problem that &apos;s really interesting is homework parenting .
They have much more EPACs and ADHD .
The Indus numbers had a profound impact .
The net charge on beef is only three parts of the herd that are raised to the market .
Actually , about three walls come from the kitchen .
The sea level rises by three , so it just collects them .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our West gardens , we &apos;ve lost sight of the use of Facebook and the Internet .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been born , which is why the oceans die .
So just like you might think of a club , in all these different ways , proteins and , more than three , are highly effective signs .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And finally , the puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce lakes that can provide good benefits to sea protein .
It should be a green fluorescent organism , a rapidly growing and changing environment that has the potential to shape its own catwalks , and it should be EPA , DHA , Omix3 and Gate East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for 15 years .
Whenever I say this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it all .
But don &apos;t try it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we did that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million in the oceans .
I mean , it &apos;s all just happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , the problem is there .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was born with a large brain to read , because I have a brother who is a neurological condition called schizophrenia .
More recently , I wanted to understand , as a scientist , how can I connect my dreams with my own reality and make my own dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what &apos;s happening is that they don &apos;t naturally connect their dreams with the public and the public realities , and they perform their actions .
So I &apos;ve spent my life studying severe mental illness .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I studied at the President Francesca Bank , which was in Philadelphia at Harvard University .
So what was the answer to the biological level ? What was the difference between people &apos;s brains , who are normally thought of as being compared to people &apos;s brains in Scottish , or parts of Scottish , or parts of Pythagoras , ? So what we were trying to do is actually make a map of the brain &apos;s psyche map , whose cells were sending the message , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the body with the
So I had a lot of privilege in my life because I was doing this kind of research day , but on a weekend and weekend , I was traveling to Newcastle Airways on a trip to these mountains .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself in front of an intellectual desk .
The bottom left of my brain was a nine-story story .
And for the next four hours , I watched my brain become completely disillusioned by the ability to understand information .
In the morning of my college , I was able to read and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is the real human brain .
This is the main part of the brain which sits in the back of my brain with a touchpad attached to the back of my brain , and this will lead to me .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
For those of you who think that computers , the right part of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left parts of our brain , operates like a solar processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the entire culture of the organ , 300 empty filters .
But they &apos;re also identical to each other .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing each part has completely different knowledge , knowing that their opinions are different , and letting you let it happen , and I think their identities are very different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . Compassion .
SOC : Well done .
( Laughter ) The evidence that we have in our brains is just now thinking about the moment .
Here , at the moment , you &apos;re thinking of part of our brain in these tissues , and this is thinking organically about the movements of our bodies .
Information is shaped up in the body and restored throughout the body by our whole nervous system , and then it comes down and forms a great ambulance class , which , in the present moment , tells us what &apos;s happening in the present day and what &apos;s happening in the mind , and what &apos;s learning .
I am an energy geographically connected from the energy of the brain to the right-hand part of the brain .
We &apos;re the energy required to connect with each other through the right-hand part of the brain to a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers of this planet who are responsible for making this world a better place .
And at that moment , we are all the best and wonderful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left-right part of our brain is scientifically and scientifically thinking .
The brain on the left is about the past and the future .
The building blocks of the brain also reveals that the largest ambucycles of our world are now beginning to collect and then assemble into analytics .
And it also informs us to organize and integrate this whole information about all the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely the influences of our projects .
The left part of our brain thinks in language .
It &apos;s this continuous conversation that has really connected us and our inner world to the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me , you have to remember to go home and buy something .
I &apos;m going to need them in the morning , and it &apos;s an awareness of me creating a book that reminds me of where I need to go .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; I ! I am ! &quot;
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become dead .
I become the only trapped person with the energy in my neighborhood and with you .
And that part of my brain , that morning , was dead in the afternoon .
The morning of the assault , my left eye in the back of my eye , exploded with deep pain .
It was as traumatic as the wound heels of the wound on the bone .
And that pain is what drove me and left me .
He died , and then he left .
It was so striking to me that I had never had any pain , and I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing . I start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to church and I went to my career camp , which is a typical body training machine .
Now I &apos;m interested in this machine , because it makes me feel like I &apos;m the fate of an early man who moved to Donna .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is such an unusual and poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the way I had changed my mind , which is the general sense of truth that I &apos;m a person who &apos;s walking past the machine , but now I was in a rich and mysterious place where my conscious@@
And it was all very strange and poor , and my head was dizing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started walking around the room , and I realized that there was everything going on in my body .
And everyone has a very , very narrow understanding .
I have no access to my speed , and I have to say , a home has simply been put into the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my living room ready to underneath the water and I &apos;m really listening to a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying yes , my background has to play you now .
Yet my foot goes down , and then my balance goes up , and I roll down , and I roll down the wall .
I look around and I look at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t now reframe the waves of my body .
I couldn &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped because my hand was held up by atoms and molecular walls and atoms and molecules .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the speech on the left of my brain has become completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice on a regular monitor .
A silver lining .
Once upon a time , I was amazed at the atrocities in my brain .
But then immediately , there was another kind of energy emerging on this great rocket of space around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt my great awe and my strong awe .
I experienced myself a part of that energy , which was beautiful .
And then one of the things that emerged on the left side of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a member of the problem . &quot;
We should be helpful , and I told myself I &apos;m really nervous from any problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I &apos;m really nervous about the problem , but I immediately came back to what I &apos;m calling the most money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Look how beautiful it is to be in a place where you &apos;re completely connected to this tiny little brain that connects you to the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this vessel where my job is and I &apos;m getting a lot of press about it .
I felt a lot of shame in my body .
And look , all of your relationships that come from the outside world , and from that , some of the stress is missing .
And I felt a real sense of urgency .
And measure what it would look like if you were staying behind this 70-year-old emotional burden that you have stayed with .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a mistake . I made a mistake .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left of my brain and said , &quot; &quot; Oh , wow !
We need someone , and I &apos;m thinking I should be helpful , so I gotta get some stuff off the back of the house , and I put it into my yard , and now I &apos;m thinking , can I drive my car ? I can drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And in that moment , my hands have been completely fueled .
It was then that I realized that my God was attacking me by going to college , the next thing that my mind tells me is how amazing this is .
( Laughter ) How amazing is that ?
How many neuroscientists would have thought about this opportunity to see their brains come in and simulate themselves from the inside — ( Laughter ) and then came into my brain one day . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very busy woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to frame . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop talking about college , but in a matter of two weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my habits . Okay .
I have to call out for help . I have to call up . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the first job , and then I remembered that I had my own business card on which my phone is .
So I go into my living room and I spend about three inches of Matthew cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , although I can see from my naked eyes what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you this is my card , not because I &apos;m looking at any of the red dots around me .
And the words would be corpses of paper and punch cards , and I wasn &apos;t reading anything .
So I started waiting for what I call the Indus script .
And at that moment , the typical truth was repeated , and I learned that this is not a card ; this is not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to decrease the fishing idea .
And in that period of 45 minutes , the impact on the left was getting higher .
I don &apos;t understand the number . I don &apos;t want to get a phone , but I don &apos;t have a road .
So I take the phone and I plug it in .
I took a Bismarck and I put it there , and now I &apos;m watching petty thumbs on the phone as the matriarch clicks .
But then I take my turn to the next level when I returned , and I never recall that I had asked them the question .
So I grabbed hold of my college girl &apos;s hand like a doll and we were down on the Hindus and we were pushing these boys with our other hand and saying , &quot; &quot; When I come back to the normal truth , I can tell you that I had just come back to India before , and finally came across the entire Indian village , and I heard that a droid on the cockpit of my grandfather , a friend
So I say this in my own brain , &quot; I &apos;m speaking , I need to help . &quot;
And for me , the voice is like &quot; &quot; ubuntu &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like the Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; Then she came to me that I had no idea that I could speak a language and I could not understand until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And shortly after that , a surge in an ambulance was rushed to the hospital by a reserve to Boston .
I would climb up and look like children of a small tail .
Just like the one in which the rest of the herd had fallen out of the bank , I pulled the energy out and I realized the gift of my soul .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer in my life .
Or , the doctor saves me and gives me a second chance or a second chance of my transmission .
By the time I finished , I was surprised that I still survive .
When I experienced my spirit in heaving , then I gave life the God rescue .
Now my brain was inspired by two different facts .
It was at that time that my emotional system started to psyche with only empathy with pain .
The light was shining my brain like the fire in the forest , and the air was so strong and so bright that I could not hear a voice from the background or from the noise of my voice , and I was just peddling further down the street .
Because I had no way of knowing where I was in my body , so I felt enormous and wide open like a person freed from my bowl .
And my spirit has been unleashed , like a great herd of rolling through the sea of silence .
Great Growth .
I got the quality that the privilege was .
And I was reminded of that , and I thought that it would never be possible that I would be able to find my own great desire to learn from within the small body .
But then I realized , &quot; &quot; But I am still alive !
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been incarcerated .
And if I have been blessed with neurons and I still live , then whatever life is that can happen is the neuron , and I &apos;ve seen the world that has been fueled by people with beauty and compassion and love , people who know they can sometimes feel this quality .
And they can be chosen to mentor life , and the truth is that when they want to take their way to the left of their brain , they want to take their way to the search for perfect quality .
And then I realized how powerful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; This is the kind of status quo that has taught me to navigate my life .
And it inspired me to be healthy .
After a period of half-heartedly injury , the south center of my brain pumped out a large amount of blood vessels like a pig of blood vessels that were detecting the brain &apos;s respiratory function .
I &apos;m here with my mom , who &apos;s a real fate in my life .
It took me eight years to become completely healthy .
So who are we then ?
We are the most powerful force of life , artificial skill and two extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world where we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step onto the right of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , and I am the power of life .
Fifty-one , beautiful molecular machinery , embedded in a shape that is all there .
Or I can choose to step back to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a trivial way .
From quantum leaning . &quot; &quot; Adorn yourselves .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
I have an inside us us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain trying to eradicate the urban power supply , the more we put peace in this world and the more protected our planet will be .
And I thought that was worth spreading this idea .
Thank you .

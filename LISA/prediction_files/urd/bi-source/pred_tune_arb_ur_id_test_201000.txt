Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They picked up my name , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , as a young boy , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating them .
So I asked myself , do you have the Arab Spring ?
He looked at me strangely , I thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sirens ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Sirens , horror . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minneo , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minneo . &quot; &quot; Is the French right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; she said .
He was speaking to me with three people , as he said to me , &quot; If this were the last girl in the world , I would not see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young Kenyan girl posted two words and placed them in exactly the same way as a girl .
How can he speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough !
What is the right to express my language in my own country ?
Where could that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am as many people as I am , who are walking into a circle of life where , in some sense , they are destroying everything that is in their own mind , just because they &apos;re so enjoyable to say it , they are so enlightened and so vulnerable .
Should I be leading my culture , my imaginations , my spirits and spirits ?
Could we have the most important battle candidate for children ?
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
How does that make sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice as spiritual as he did for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of the synagogue , or the research , the language that we use in the neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we observe when we work on projects for an emergency tree , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the iPod .
If we do that , they will cover us .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask these questions !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
This is a fact .
But the second most important fact we need to think about .
It &apos;s the Arabic Mother &apos;s language .
Research says that in order to achieve mastery in other languages , you need to translate your mother tongue .
In other languages , the teaching of the mother tongue is the primary means of creativity .
How ?
The Greban cell , when he first started writing , exploded Arabic .
All of their ideas , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in the circle where she grew up , felt a certain joy , sounded a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you reach in English , you feel the same joy , the same feeling .
Now , you can imagine that this is also their teaching in English , this little girl running in these villages , who was living in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no engineer can do .
The second thing is , it often says that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact of emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China are in all directions .
That &apos;s why they create laws for protecting their language .
They make it valuable .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re using it in the walls , they &apos;re investing a lot of money on the dissemination of Vienna .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the emerging world , this growing mindset is not reaching us yet , and we want to get to the emerging world .
They were countries that were like us in one period of time , but decided to attempt to rise , to research , to go to those countries , such as trucks , businesses , etc . , they spoke with their own language as if they were chasing girls — as if they were .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you &apos;re a product of a truck or a product , and it &apos;s not written on a truck , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these characters , not in the characters , as we are more time .
So in order to create new inventions and applications , they needed to maintain their language .
If I were to say , &quot; &quot; Religion , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what would you remember ?
What would you understand ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how , how .
Languages aren &apos;t just about the conversation , words are about us .
Language is a sign of the particular level of our lives , and the sentences that are constrained by our emotions .
So when we say &quot; &quot; compassion , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special mushroom in your brain , a special feeling for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of a word or two or three .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our brain ?
How would you understand it or not ?
So if I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I better leave and I don &apos;t spend a lot of time talking about it .
The thing is , it reminds us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker who &apos;s benefited from a French .
Once upon a time , I was asking her what happened .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to get her her shoulder and translate it one night to try and translate what she meant to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Women mistakenly told her &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then several nights later , she tried to think about it .
He wondered , how could someone really show up ?
Do they want to self-assemble ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of many examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; it was a different way of thinking about it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he says to me , and one night , I tried to translate it to him , to feel what I felt when I witnessed the war . &quot; &quot; A young woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have raised her hand and why you are . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I have hidden your hands and you have left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
It translates . It gives me a shot .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to speak Arabic ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started to speak Arabic .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whether it &apos;s cold , keep it quiet . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The main defense of the Arabic dictionary made a point , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because , you know , we don &apos;t think it would be .
And if anyone says to me , I &apos;m bored from Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in this way that our desires , our desires and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the way we think about it and the way we think about it .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the East , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; Get the right signs .
It &apos;s very easy , but it &apos;s good and it &apos;s effective .
After that , we started another lake with a landscape of letters on the Earth .
You , looking outside at an example of it , a landscape in which the letters of the black and the blue are sitting in the roof , with the tradition , &quot; Kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really don &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to find a existence for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great opportunity to create new and exciting opportunities .
After that , we found boys and girls in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; Couples &quot; &quot; and girls .
We are so good !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve described the word &quot; &quot; chocolate &quot; &quot; as if they want to make a double bind , but I have the same word that &apos;s good for them and the same reality .
I don &apos;t say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; as I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these aren &apos;t musicians ! We don &apos;t want to hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to let anyone grow up , or that we &apos;re going to have a choice about language , putting pressure on us , or letting us engage our patients and think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach a cell or not refine a rocket or something , we can be creative .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the global level .
He can repeatedly translate the Arabic to the first roof .
So , it doesn &apos;t matter that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we &apos;re going to have to know that , and we have to think that the solution is there , part of the solution .
By the way , what can you do today ?
Who are you running ?
To be compassionate , I reject you , though , my time is over , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the numbers , the Latin literature , don &apos;t write Arabic !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more work .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for language conservation .
Now let me tell you a secret .
A child speaks for the first time in a language of her father .
When my daughter was born , I don &apos;t believe him , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve gone from my daughter &apos;s light to the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
And it &apos;s not going to be predictable that no one &apos;s going to win . ( Applause ) You get this cultural press . ( Applause )
I &apos;m telling you Latin English to tell us that this is a tragic reminder that our situation is not a secret to our existence , that the negatives that make people dumb me down until you look at my generation and tell us that I have become tired of this generation of inequality , not until they &apos;re known to our generation when they &apos;re not known to celebrate cultures , where we &apos;re expected to share
( Applause )
My favorite card details are data .
In college , my primary denominator was a gardener , which meant I had a lot of writing equipment .
Now a typical person when they write something , the way they do it is going to work .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do your job in a small way , but in the first week , you &apos;re going to do a lot of work , and after a lot of work , everything &apos;s done , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
My approach would be this .
My answer would be all right , but actually the work of the infrastructure would get there , and then I would do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all the institutions .
And then again came a whole new paper on the page , a paper which you did for a year .
And I knew that my common denominator was not a pencil for dealing with this .
It was a huge task .
I organized a plan , I decided I would do something like this .
Something like this will happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , in between , the way jobs are going to increase , and eventually I &apos;m going to double that as a graduate student .
How hard would it be to solve ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ?
Come and get home , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt an amazing project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would also go home , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were somewhat familiar .
And two weeks went by a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went home one day , and I spent three days in David Laun , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , and I paid 90 pages , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , one streets , one
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you running late ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the dad . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s fine . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look at me today , that &apos;s the best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very good . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Yes , I &apos;m blogging today .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the system .
My Rwanda gives people a hunger all the time , and I wanted to tell the sixth people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my suggestion was that the brain structure differences between people and six people .
To find out that I made a leaf where I could get both brains of the same way and the brain of the chest , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually going to show you now .
I want you to look away and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , that &apos;s not a good demonstration , but consider it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
There are decades of decisions in both brains , but the rest of the human brain is fun to create .
Now what does this mean for a singular person ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine when it doesn &apos;t .
&#91; Workforce is the best time . &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart people will make a decision to make a point , but the building doesn &apos;t like this project , so he runs the baton , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please pass the baton &quot; &quot; to ignore the baton . &quot; &quot; The baton of the baton will ignition and the baton will , because I think it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;re going to go to the pub , and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After this , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which is beginning to talk about the meaning of the TEDTalk , and very soon it will be stopped looking at the Internet for the mothers of Tony Boulanger .
( Laughter ) It will take a while for all of these things , so there won &apos;t be any time for it today .
What &apos;s the deal ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the foundation of compassion that you want to give .
It just wants to be in existence .
It seems to me that the future has nothing to do with the mind of two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s fine .
If you do and you spend your life going further and easily , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Good nutrition , good thought , and increased generation , maybe that &apos;s what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not that far off .
We are a growing demand , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a conscious decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re moving away .
We make big plans .
And he thinks about all of these things .
And all we want to do is figure out what to do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes it seems like they do what is easily and emotionally friendly , like eating , thinking , or feeling out of opportunity .
It &apos;s a shame for that .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the ultimate betrayal .
And for strangers , it always leads to an end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet , easy and crazy path that tends to be out of the room .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) The trade zone is the place where strangers are doing the right thing .
That &apos;s where services are becoming aspirational when they don &apos;t have to be compassionate .
In the dark sphere , what I &apos;m showing you , it &apos;s not really because it &apos;s not the right , it &apos;s the right — space feeling , fear , excitement — and self-suffering — it &apos;s all the properties that are in place .
The question is , in this case , when the building blocks , how do we get people to step into the abyss , which is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that systems are also providing protection , which protect them at all times in their markets — somebody mentioned it at home .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s a household which is more common , but when David Lawn gets near it , it becomes very common , or at the time when people are at risk of embarrassment , of employment or scary outcomes .
And the key thing is that the building is just like that .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and gave me a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was at TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and my affair , something in the brain that was struggling with mystery was wrong .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian cross for the bottom 20 feet of India , we &apos;ll just go home when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a month later , people at TED decided to sign the names of the Mermaid .
I picked up the Web and it was my picture of me holding it home .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house that was robust , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the household , he wandered around the tree !
And finally , and finally , smart decision-makers sent me the job and I could start talking .
Now the homework assignment that explains every category requires a broadcast , like me , someone like me would give two weeks to a piece of paper and not be able to write a piece of paper , and then , amazingly , it gives you an incredible amount of credibility to go to sleep every night and write a piece of paper .
And the three clearance systems , in this case , are called the system of strangers .
It &apos;s not so good that anyone can do it .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the impact on it .
In fact , I &apos;ve got thousands of miles of access from around the world and from people , from all kinds of backgrounds .
They included narrators , facilitators , engineers , penetrators and high-HIV tests .
( Laughter ) And nearly one thing was said and wrote : &quot; I &apos;m also paralyzed by this issue . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and the number of emails .
In the tradition of these people , the myth was reflected on how hard she has spoken in her life , about what she has done .
I thought about it , and I said , okay ! If the system is right , what &apos;s the next ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out the system is two types .
Today I gave you examples , talking about subjects , all of them David Lawn .
And when David Lawn , recently , the effects of his recent collapse are due to the crash of household charges .
But the system is a second term , and it doesn &apos;t depend on any David Lane .
So if you want a project like this that you start with , like some kind of arts or businesses , like some kind of arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start paying attention to action , to control things .
In addition to doing so , there are many other things that David Lawn doesn &apos;t have to do with his family , like staying with his family , exercising , understanding your health , believing in your relationships , telling your relationships a little bit more about who you are not .
Now , if the only way you can do a bad job is to do a bad job , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data links in the context of creating a bad house .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t drive them , they &apos;re always with your dad .
And this is a typical metaphor for a much less glamorous way of looking at it , and it &apos;s much less glamorous than the traditional metaphor , a lot of basic literacy .
You have good news and good news .
And it can be a symptom of the Taliban and beyond .
So I thought it was because of their email , and they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban teachers have found them , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I picked up all the email and one thing came out — I think there &apos;s no sixth people .
I think all of you can .
It may not be a particularly complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of the data from the dad , but the remembering labels when David Lawn wasn &apos;t there .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of life .
Every single market is a week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t a lot of blogs , especially when some of them have been exchanged .
I think we all need to get rid of this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because in every single life there is no time in life .
We need to act compassionately .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have eight homes there , maybe we should start with this .
Maybe not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eight days of the United States and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan was lifted up from a region of Afghanistan , leaving a region of Afghanistan to help provide an office for the Afghan government to help protect a security office in Afghanistan to help provide a sanctuary for the Afghan government to help provide a sanctuary for the Afghan government to help provide a
He came in at the end of an attack , and he lived around three , and with so many things , he watched as a child by the time Captain Sevin , he watched as a child as a child by the time Captain Sevin , and he watched as a child by the time he would take the secrets and take the dead .
One of the people who knew her parents and she grew up with a German accent and she grew up next to a Hebrew accent and she grew up with a Hebrew accent .
So it showed that the capacity for the captain &apos;s Seventine and Eno is associated with the extinction phobia that &apos;s in the wild .
They put them in helicopters , and then you see what they &apos;re doing in Cape Town , and they &apos;re putting them first so they can send others to their children .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are incredible emotions when you want to do something like this .
Here &apos;s a love and I knew why I work with people , they don &apos;t .
You know , at the end of the day , people who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In business , we give people bonuses that are willing to vote for others in order to benefit us .
We &apos;ve got an email !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re looking after the waves .
These are better people who are looking at this vision of services , and these improved people are looking at this vision of services .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is an environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the capacity to work together , so each of us has the capacity to collaborate with each other and increase the capacity to do this in others .
I have the greatest privilege of reaching out to some of these people , and we will be told yesterday that I have the greatest privilege of reaching out to some of these people , and we will be told yesterday that Jews gave themselves and their knowledge to take care of others and ask them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing : &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they are emotions , not people .
It &apos;s not possible that you &quot; &quot; pass me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It can &apos;t be that I connect two people and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does it come from ?
If you go further than 50,000 years ago , at the beginning of the journey of the Homo sapiens , we see that the world is under threat , all these forces are hardly focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal about it .
Sleep deprivation can be a rapid fast-forward tool , but these things are working together to reduce the longevity of our lives , and they &apos;re working towards reducing our lifetime .
And so we &apos;re ready in social animals where we live and work together , as I call a sympathy , as in a community where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we were compassionate and collaborative .
It has independent benefits .
Which means that I can go out and spend the night looking at some of my neighbors .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you &apos;re not going to look at risk .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The new distance is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by risk , things that are trying to make our lives difficult , or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; Our opportunities are trying to reduce our success .
It could be a huge , huge , unbelievable case of stock market .
This could be a new technology that you can download your business class in a single evening , and this could be a new technology that you could download your business class in one night .
Or it could be your opposite , which sometimes you try to exercise .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but it &apos;s at least driving your rise and trying to drive your businesses to get you out of business , and it &apos;s trying to drive your rise and your businesses to get you out of business .
We don &apos;t have any authorities .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s the place where the job is done , because it &apos;s the belief that drives the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in the organization and their lives that are preserving the lives of the people in the organization and the lives of the people in the organization , and that is to assess their well-being and their well-being in order to make people live , and that is to assess their well-being and to make people feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , that is
I was on a holiday trip , and I confirmed a fact that when a traveler tried to walk in front of him before he found it , and I looked at the staff at the door to see him in front of him as he passed the law as he was .
The first time I tried to fight it , it was the first time I tried to fight it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do we have machines like lighting ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit around like us ? &quot; &quot; And he told me exactly the same story .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we have to travel to the West Bank is not because they &apos;re giving lentils to Muslims .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are violent , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and strength keeping you safe from each other and therefore less organization .
What is a great leader for her , the most intimate example of how to make a parent is a great leader for her , the most intimate example of how to make a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what would you like ? What would you like ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to see opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s necessary , we want to see opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s necessary , to see them grow and to achieve more of what we can do for them to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for them .
Ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s exactly what they want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , organization and record , when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to give them the opportunity to have the time and to do things so that they can achieve the greater advances that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve the greater advan@@
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the head of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , was CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , which is CEO of a tech company , they said , if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organizations ? How can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charley had a practical loss of employment : Charley had a practical lack of employment .
If you &apos;re in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get to work on the basis of the problem of efficiency .
But if you &apos;ve got a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , just like we &apos;re going to do for a kid who &apos;s coming home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
The reason that these people are so frustrated and so outraged , some of the bankers are sitting at CEOs , and the reason that these people are so outraged and so outraged , some of the bankers are running from CEOs , is because these people are so outrageous and so outrageous , some of the bankers are running from CEOs , who are not doing the right thing .
It &apos;s not data .
But they have laid down fundamental laws of gravity .
They founded a local society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the victims of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the victims of their loved ones , but they &apos;ve given their loved ones to their loved ones , and they &apos;ve told them they &apos;ve made their loved ones the way their loved ones ones .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re proposing , not data .
Is there any reason why it &apos;s worth 500 million dollars to offer bananas ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problems with that ? Absolutely not .
The next leader will never sacrifice people for children .
The next leader will never sacrifice people for children .
They &apos;re going to give people skin data for their kids , but they &apos;re going to give people skin data for their kids .
In the Bush administration , a mini-finance company in the Bush administration called a mini-finance company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 called for a major trading operation , and they hired 30 percent of their citizens in the night .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy more goods .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , and so many of the companies today went into the board and did a million action .
And he answered it .
You can see that the bubble gum doesn &apos;t trust the bubble gum .
Instead , babies believe in cheating , and it &apos;s much harder to lose weight , and it &apos;s much harder to lose weight .
And then they created a personal project .
That every job , every service , from the mainframe to the CEO , would have to put everyone in a four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted it and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But just as Bob did the programming , he did it very well .
He said that it &apos;s better to take all the little bits and pieces so that some of us would give far more credit and have a lot of experience .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as people expect , when they feel protected from the dignity of a group , then trust and cooperation are flexible .
And structurally , as nobody expected , people began to trade from each other .
What was more successful was the business with low-success families .
So some people took five volunteers to get one to three volunteers .
Gravity is an exception , not the opposite .
I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the most successful organizations , and I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the best organizations which are not the leaders at all .
They &apos;re good governments , and we do what they say , because they get us there , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are dying of organizations , who are dying of authority , and they are real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have chosen to look at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve helped to look at the person on the left , and they &apos;ve helped to look at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve helped to look at the person on the right .
This is a conductor .
I heard a story about some of the things that were going on out there in the kitchen , and as philanthropists do , the way you eat your lunch is you eat your people first , and when you eat them you don &apos;t have anything to eat .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his lunch so he could eat because it was .
We tell them they start .
We call them leaders because they take risks from someone else , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe , we call them leaders , because they choose to be victims , so that people can be safe , and so that people can benefit from them , and when we do that , it becomes obvious that our people will be saved .
They give us their own blood and pneumonia and so they can see their dream becomes real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and your pancreas and you give it to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do it for us too . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to work for ?
And aren &apos;t those organizations that we &apos;re all going to like to do ? And aren &apos;t those organizations that we &apos;re all going to like to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in a little story about the story of Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is incredibly unbelievable , and in these circumstances it &apos;s very difficult to grow up once in 17 years , I was staying quiet with friends in the bush while I was in the bush .
The sun is getting very hot in summer .
And as I was staring at the breakfast table , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you create something like that that on your skin and not make you sad ? &quot; &quot; I was starving , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people have no access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and they &apos;re only in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is one of the most dangerous trichromosomes .
A reflex that happens in the eyes of the trauma is that you can easily recover from one of the most independent infections of the trachoma .
This disease affects millions of people every year on a regular basis , and the most important thing is that for children with the trachoma , you only have to give up for your mother : no eggs , no eggs , no English .
After looking at the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I went to my brother &apos;s 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a broadband Internet , I went to
And I looked at this as a personal problem .
So God said it was right , we were ready .
Now we need to be careful with this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone , 40 pages of full-time businesses , after writing my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; now and not gold ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first gold mining exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need the digestion .
( Laughter ) So after the attempt to make it work in high school and the limited means , which I had , the Egyptian Embassy entered some new people , did more of this work , and now we have fully the effects of infrastructure , which is ready for markets , but now is ready for markets .
We &apos;ve learned some green doors to get DryBath commercialized and to people .
One thing we learned was that the poor don &apos;t buy products on a huge scale .
They &apos;re just buying under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; they &apos;re buying a ticket because it &apos;s more important .
So we put DryBath in this creative slum .
You put it between him and you blow it outside .
And the best thing is , one lake exchange is only in five seconds .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath to be there in less than a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , whenever they dropped , and we could save two houses for children , which is two houses , two houses , more than two houses for school , two more houses for two more houses for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out of its centrality , its security and purpose .
DryBath is a brave man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re now in the process of setting up this program , and we &apos;re actually in the middle of a road selling it internationally , which is available in the retail market , and one question that I &apos;m going to ask you today , at the Limpopo Circle , in one week , is to deal with 50 pages of an announcement that the world doesn &apos;t have to deal with .
Are you crying ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done anything yet , I haven &apos;t done anything yet .
And the more important thing is that I learned a lot from this early work , Google announced me last year as the world &apos;s greatest youth .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest entrepreneur in the world &apos;s first African entrepreneur , who owns this account , and one of the things that surprised me so much , that all of this passion for why not honor . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m here today to share with you some of the results , and I &apos;ve also been surprised to myself what are the actual causes of success in organizations , which are the causes of actually initial success .
I believe that nonprofit organizations are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will get the human capital that was once impossible .
You &apos;re going to make them possible .
But if initial organizations are the best , why do the majority of failures occur ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to think .
I wanted to know that eventually things are the most important for success .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , reflecting a lot of my ideas and misconceptions that came from some of the other organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was a product founder of a dozen years of various businesses , going from high school to high school when I was building solar machines , then high school , when I was making radio .
I graduated from college , and I started a foundation of Safety and company .
And 20 years ago , the epidemic started , in the last 20 years , we started to set up hundreds and hundreds of companies , and very big failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to put theorists on these factors to the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s something .
So I named my company &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s the old days you feel about it .
With interference , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to perceive smoking or drink , is even more critical .
I never thought there would be a TED Talk by the researcher , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s a project , until I don &apos;t need one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business as well .
A team in transformation is important for the ability to deal with hidden away from the ground .
Sometimes it &apos;s an actual fact .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear way of doing things ?
With him , it seemed to me that the most important thing for success is the most important thing .
So think about innovation .
Sometimes institutions make a huge investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
After this , of course — is it the right time ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t ready for it ?
It &apos;s hard , so you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or came out of a lot of chaos , and I was very frightened first ?
So I &apos;ve gone from many , many organizations to many .
And the idea came out of 100 companies , and 100 of them from outside to try to find a scientific result .
So first of these ideas for companies , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of revenue .
And at the lower level of five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we had a lot of hope , but no success .
And then I tried to cultivate all of these characters , as I think they went forward in these places .
And then from outsourcing ideas , I saw weird things like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
Nuclear companies were very investing , and sometimes they were entrepreneurial models , but they couldn &apos;t do it .
I tried to know that the most important factors had been the success and failure of all these companies , and the result struck me .
The first was the choice of time .
Twenty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
Team and Klee are on the other hand , and then , I think , being different , being unique , it &apos;s actually a third number .
But it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not true that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was surprised that I didn &apos;t think it was the most important .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business models and investment in my mind .
I think the market model is still worth less , because you can start a business model without a business model , and then when you grow crops in cows , you include them .
And investment , if investment was low , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples here of all of these noes .
A great success on Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s a famous company that many investors looked at because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to put some of their houses into a grocery store ?
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of compassion is that the best business model , the workplace , is the right time .
It was a long way ahead of the financial problems that people needed additional support , and it was safe to help people respond to the advice of giving in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came along , the best companies , the best business models , the best thinkers .
However , time was absolutely right , making the downloads they needed .
Dragon was also aspiring for an extra help ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 , was at a time when the campaign wanted more hatred .
We thought it was the best , but actually , the right time was probably the most important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was one of those online entertainment companies .
We were very excited about it . In a lot of ways , with a great business model , we had to work with great artists at Holland .
In 1999 and 2000 , the broadband Internet was very , very low .
It was very difficult to watch the video , you didn &apos;t have to know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company started in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the curriculum was solved by Adobe Flash , and the top 50 percent of the curriculum in America fell apart , YouTube was at the very best .
Incredibly , the best of times .
It turns out that YouTube , when it started , had no business models of it .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But she was the absolute best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
Think is very powerful .
But maybe time is really important .
And the best way to test time is to see if they &apos;re really ready for your success .
And the real security thing is , the outcomes don &apos;t come from them , because if you like something , you want to watch it tomorrow , but in terms of time frame you have to work very safely .
As I said , initial organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
I hope some of them will contribute to increasing your chances of success , and then not in the second best case scenario .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 a.m. in 2016 we saw the biggest data in history . &#93; &#91; Financial success , pushed people &apos;s enthusiasm and talent . &#93; &#91; A lot of money is spent on non-governmental companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve done the scrutiny of the Gulf Votes to explain . &#93; &#91; The center of the week &apos;s history is central to the center of the
And from that point on , they painted stories from the small pockets of white clothing companies .
We have the inner stories of villages , banks and schools that are coming along with fashion designs like fashion shows and saying , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a home company , can you teach us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at Michael , you can look at text messages , you can look at the way you do things , you can see how they work .
It &apos;s starting to show up .
The prime minister of Aesis Linda was famous .
We also have this news that the poor desert detectors are the descendants .
The revenue of the next two billion dollars goes to the main source of the Russian Empire from his childhood friend , who &apos;s a famous secretary .
And many brave people will be contagious , and those who will be familiar with these stories will be familiar with further hidden devices .
Now this tells me a story of a magic film , or a story of Jane Jesus , who I am .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that the grammar and the power of people sitting in their pockets and how they shouldn &apos;t be taxed , meaning that the fine progress , like teachers &apos; health and education , have less money .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , this discovery is amazing .
The global media and political leadership are talking about how people in the fashion industry frame their influence on what we &apos;re discovering with our hands .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful , wonderful world for people , and it &apos;s very difficult to think of how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s sort of like the Russian girls .
You can start a company with another company , another company with another company , which is almost impossible to figure out which one is behind .
It &apos;s hard to think about what is happening to institutions like Texas , press , schools .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that the U.S. hasn &apos;t talked about it .
Maybe it &apos;s because the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be in the hospital .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in smart companies .
The reason for that is that the U.S. Foundation approach works is because there &apos;s only a few of them .
I think if we &apos;re going to invent the Queen Air Force , or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the New Zealand , what &apos;s the relationship between America ?
But a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give a lot of information , they have to give a little bit less information to run for the company than the library cards .
In American schools , information like this is flowing from the ground up .
It makes it easier for a venture capitalist to invest in .
The root of the epidemic affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Ventures , we wanted to see how the problem was .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was , we switched a campaign across 13 government agencies .
Our foundation became an African minister , and she wanted to move to America to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The sad thing was that all of the villages could make a prediction of how the village could move their village .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t create our own currency , and we didn &apos;t pay anybody any money , but it was a terrible state of the system .
It &apos;s also important that it doesn &apos;t fit into individual transactions .
It &apos;s not about private equations that have talked about our obsession with cheating and inspiration .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , the way the tickle looks , the way it protects weight , the weight and the weight .
And to make that happen , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game in order to make it difficult to create .
It can be intuitive , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people who are passionate and empowered are always .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of companies .
It was a political event , but the British Prime Minister of Medicine pegged for eight seconds in the Gulf of South America in 2013 .
And Europe has since established a central record of the establishment , which is exactly who owns the corporations or is controlling them .
The evidence is that HIV is behind it .
The difference in terms of reforming arbitrary laws in the central and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to get higher , so we were five .
They want to look at exploration , larger markets , which are used throughout the world and in the U.S.
In the Gulf Ventinas , this is the cause of change .
We need to reach out to the people who are hungry for their knowledge campaigns .
You know , they make a sound , they &apos;re not good for this kind of security , we do .
We need politicians to address this issue , and to help revolutionize the legitimate transformation of hidden information .
We can reverse engineer the secret to the challenge of creating and improving the classroom .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lickens , who invented you , have had more feelings in the last few years than any other media outlet .
Can that be true ?
Julie Song : Yes , can it be ?
This is an insight — what isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world today is showing us that entrepreneurs are able to create a small group of businesses in a way that is more than all the media in the world .
CA : How did that happen ?
How do people recruit from organizations ?
And how do you deal with them ?
Julian Sangju : There we are . I can tell you — there are public services in the right way , and we have so many ways that they can bring information to us .
So we use a lot of high-water reserves to put materials on the Internet from one place to the other , to deliver them to legal bridges like Sweden and Bill &apos;s .
We get the information from the databases , from ordinary data , from Rams or whatever , common news organizations like that , founding — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about giving massive information to people and then protecting yourself against illegal legal and political philanthropy .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to figure out how to make sure that these are the key ingredients , but you never really know what the tools are .
Julie Singer : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ll never be able to catch that live , and if we get there at some point in time , we get the skin from the skin to transmit that information .
( Gunshot ) God bless him .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of coming up here and asking you what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , it &apos;s a Caroll Report .
It was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was over there for 18 years .
He was a medical student in Kenya .
And when it comes to the power of the book — the power of the original forces that were trying to figure out how to make it happen , they bought 20 million pounds of paper towels on the laptop and on one more report .
And then the government looked at it and used it against their political will , which was the best people — now the most enthusiastic people in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why in 2007 , and we were able to get this right from the very first election in December 2008 .
When we took that report , we decided three days later to reach the mall , Kabby decided to become a friend of the person who was horrified by Daniel Arp , so this report went completely over to the corner of the capital .
Chris Anderson : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s that — it &apos;s happened in Kenya , it &apos;s not a zero-sum game , it &apos;s a zero-sum game , it &apos;s a zero-sum game , and it changed the result in your game .
Julian Shang : Yes . This is the headlines of Guardian and then throughout the entire country of Kenya , in Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from outside .
And he , after a few months , convinced Kenyan entrepreneurs that they could talk about it .
And it was on the TV show 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the numbers 10 percent , according to a Chinese sex report , and it changed the result .
CA : Oh , so how did your intelligence actually change the world ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re showing you a little bit of a video of a little bit of volunteers .
It &apos;s just like video , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;m going to show you now , a high-definition video .
RSW : ... Good luck , when you first send them two .
I see , oh , there are four with them .
It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s okay . Giles are chocolate .
When they &apos;re in front of you , tell me , go read .
All of them are dollars .
Glass , glue !
( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running .
Hotel . Have a two-way mirror , two-way mirror .
We should now , time is up !
Okay , now we &apos;ve got eight people .
Here we see two volunteers , and we &apos;re still floating geysers .
Roger . They &apos;re on my show .
Two things , two things , we &apos;re at home .
Well , what would society be ? What would happen ?
God bless you , God bless you . Good luck . Yeah , I gave them data .
Chris Anderson : So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : Where people were working on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally brought two guys together to do more research .
These were the first in three places that happened .
CA : So 11 people in this situation , right ? Two smart drivers ?
Julian Sung : Yes ! Two rows of the Royal Rights , two little children were kidnapped .
Twenty-six people broke together .
Chris Anderson : And after his execution , it was so sad .
What was the fundamental cause of the misery , you think ?
Julian Sung : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as incredibly unequal to power .
On the one hand , some people go to the grass and then a kilometer away from the U.S. Health Capter starts pouring over 30 miles per hour of electricity on everyone — whatever it is — and gives birth to children as well .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t in any way aware of this , because they were conscious .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadcasting was awarded , and it said that he had confirmed in Cheetos that he had shown you that this video had over 280,000 and a half American records .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sung : So what we did was we accepted the offerings .
Five days ago , it took me to work , to get 150,000 pieces and 50 pieces .
But we &apos;ve now given them a license to a U.S. public safety house in the beginning of the year , but they don &apos;t have any relationship .
I mean , I used to come to this school a lot .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of applications for American safety .
Julian Sangju : We &apos;re going to do it . ( CA : Would you do it ? ) Julian Sanging : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Song : Because these things are showing that , actually , in the case of , what the Arab states are doing , they are violating human rights violations .
If you look at the hidden devices , the material is inside them .
Chris Anderson : Let &apos;s talk about that .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy normally ?
Why are you creating hidden information ?
Julian Sung : So the question is , how important information in the world is , what information can be made possible .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that , in order to make organizations secure , agencies spend a lot of money , it &apos;s a good indication that when they want to get the information out , they want to do something good with it , because what they know best , and they know the stories about it , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of press .
CA : But are there risks to this as individually or as a collective society , where innovation doesn &apos;t exist unexpectedly ?
Julie Shang : We didn &apos;t have the opportunities with them .
I mean , our biggest hurricane is practical .
With information , we &apos;re monitoring in a particular way the information that &apos;s being private — there &apos;s information that &apos;s being measured by somebody .
But there are also some contradictions — your physician has your information ; it &apos;s a miracle — but we &apos;re talking about the civil services that come in and out of poverty .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing it with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , a father , whose daughter is applied to the American flag , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people like to attack other people .
It shows an American science of dead people .
And what this does is — but it has shown millions of people around the world that the United States is political .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter &apos;s not , what would you say ? What would you say ?
Julian Sung : Here &apos;s how we ask so many questions .
But in the remembering self , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people don &apos;t have to watch a video , so they &apos;re looking at it .
It doesn &apos;t have to be different from how they look , it doesn &apos;t have to be different from how they look .
Because they all look somewhat familiar .
It will change the incentives and the incentives that make it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you seem to be expecting hope in what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to see this light switch on , that you would have to have a secret to your own mind ?
Julian Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not all different .
We have no idea what other religious people think .
If they do that , it &apos;s a very difficult situation for us to do that , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally curious about how they &apos;re going to increase the jobs later .
Chris Anderson : I think , what we &apos;ve got to do is to figure out what to do — this is to fight the invisible .
You can also imagine that there &apos;s going to be different kinds of crazy , different kinds of crazy things .
One is the hero of hope .
Or we can make problems .
What &apos;s the point of the Eurozone ?
And what are the problems ?
Julian Sanguage : Oh ! Let &apos;s do something about it .
CA : These are very good people , geese , very good .
We &apos;re going to have to try and — they &apos;re going to show you one example .
Here &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is a little old . Right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sung : This is an example of the work that we do almost every day .
Last year — in November there were millions of very important clusters in bananas , like the cells in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report card — which was a very good experiment about it — which was to say that , in fact , they had all these different opposite companies running the show , and they watched .
And there were some former military governments , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report , so for us it was a very difficult task .
We didn &apos;t know who was writing and what it was about .
So we were wondering , maybe this company has done all this against play .
At the foundation we turned it on , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we have no idea .
We don &apos;t really , but what can we do ?
It &apos;s okay , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that he wrote this , he wanted to figure out how to do it . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to write the article . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legal for this ?
Is this really yours ? Well , they brought us to Scripture with the name of manufacturing with microfinance .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s one way of thinking about what materials are , and it &apos;s trying to write and achieve with these people .
CA : All right . So , ever import information from the inside of the bag ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah , we have so much , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re collecting and mixing steps just like difficult steps .
And so our response to this has been going on in a couple of months because we &apos;re improving our own food system because of the rare social waste that we have .
This is a formula .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s going on , we &apos;re more likely to be engaged because of our greater diversity , and what that means is that we have a lot of social services , but we don &apos;t have people to be able to process this information and visualize it .
CA : So that &apos;s a real problem , essentially , how many press coverage or journalists are demanding ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re a organization that &apos;s very hard to solve very quickly , because the materials that we have to deal with are the materials that we need to organize , so we need to get them to work with people that have a lot of sensitivity to work on the materials of resilience , and then less sensitive to things .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re telling us something about your own self and how you got to work .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julian Sangju : Yeah , my parents were in the movies business and they were moving away from the neighborhood , so the two things were affected .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean , a psychologist , it would be that everything you do can be a mental disaster .
Julie Song : What , the philosophy business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one giant at a young age and you came up with a lot of hard work .
Julian Sung : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time when I got invited to the crime .
That &apos;s why you need to use words and words with your heart .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that you can use different things .
Unfortunately , at that time , it was only Russian mafia that allowed your grandmother to become a banker .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not the word that it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re running a Grandma bank account , but what do you think your core value is ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things that have helped them to feed them ?
Julian Sung : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But primary value : well , good , hard people don &apos;t generate masters ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from my father and some of the other brave and terrible people that live in my life .
Chris Anderson : Can powerful and lousy people not generate their own empathy ?
Julian Sung : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m an elderly man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing a vegetable , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of growing a mammal , which is approaching the pollen .
And that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s in my office for many , many years .
Chris Anderson : So we &apos;ve just got this last minute : What happened in the last year ?
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then the news is that he &apos;s given a huge violation of storytelling .
Instead , they inspired your situation .
So you &apos;re very famous in the Ocean . So what happened ?
Julie Song : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
The Ocean has been a crisis .
There she was .
The bankers had gone up to 10 , the rest of the economy .
Well , we did that report last year .
And the state of the Taliban , five minutes before the press , was like a movie : &quot; The heart rate went to Newsweek , and the state of the Netizens was , &quot; That &apos;s never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the web , time-lapse all the time , and we &apos;re getting so famous in the Ocean , I went to the Ocean and talked about it .
And these elements of the people over there weren &apos;t supposed to be again , and as a result , the ASL scientists , along with some of the other international experts , we named an ASLEs curriculum , such as a Freedom Media , the world &apos;s greatest safety sphere , gave birth to new Nobel Prize .
A North country is like a North country , which is heading up from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Ocean Parliament celebrated it .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look towards the future , do you realize that it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or do we observe real power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julian Sanging : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to agree with the law of liberty and the law of transparency , in the rest of the world — Europe , China and the United States .
What will it look like ? It &apos;s difficult to say .
So it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : All right , so it seems like I &apos;m making an incredible translation of people who call it , Johannes , with respect , and all your power .
Julie Sung : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was in the shop .
I don &apos;t like to play games and watch them .
So I did this , which is the heart of the heart .
I &apos;d browse my childhood connectome and I &apos;d see it in the gardens .
When I grew up in college and came home in the early 1990s , I had this epiphany .
My team broke .
And when I looked at it from a little bit of a personal point of view , I thought , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to some remote places where I &apos;d been to places like North Carolina , Picasso , or London , where I &apos;d seen four animals turning barefoot on the fence of New Delhi , they were — well , fine , fine , silent and codes .
And I thought it was a big bizarre thing , and I wondered if anyone else ever had a printing press .
And when I found out about this , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at these Catholic teams .
The ordinary people see something like this .
To constrain the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human quality .
What did we do 10,000 years ago when we separated ourselves from our ancestors ?
If you look at the oil palm a thousand years ago , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s very rare and disturbing , you &apos;ll see all kinds of organisms .
But if you go back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cow , cow , cow and cow .
It &apos;s also useful for pay .
You look at mine 150 or 200 years before New York City &apos;s travels , you &apos;ll see pictures , beads and dolphins .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of maggots — the wheels , the turtles , but also the turtles .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shake .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
In the last 50 years we &apos;ve been doing this kind of thing .
The second great battle left us with a tremendous passion to be strong .
During the great war we developed technologies such as snowflakes , lightbulbs and things like that .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see the greatest additional capacity of income .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that famine and philanthropy have become increasingly enjoyable , and within a two-year period , it has become increasingly out-of-the-box .
Now if you collect fertilizer and forest pollution , it &apos;s going to be equal to two Chinese twins every year .
My favorite example of using Chinese coauthors is not the only thing , because Chinese is not the largest nation , but also the largest volunteer .
Let &apos;s now turn to our favorite paintings .
The first is the greatest use of salt in the United States and the West .
The Gulf is an incredibly wealthy device .
Only one cup of coal gets fed to market for five , 10 , 15 cups of coal .
The Indus trading is also unbelievable .
In a study done in Darwinian neuroscience , it &apos;s been shown to be extremely ineffective for breeding ground hydrogen sulfide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where the battlefield is banned , they are the battlefields of the mangroves .
Now look at these nice characters .
It puts the footprint of the Earth in its place to protect the coastal environment , the yeast , the yeast and the yeast , all the major things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the Mongolian war .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching billions of coal plants .
Here &apos;s another procedure that the philosopher Marc fundamentalist calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the track , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Now , there &apos;s been a number of years that little girls are getting bored from nothingness , but with it , with a very large number of other bodies dying apart and turning into flour .
And many times it &apos;s working with the slums , which are named after the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the Rift , which means that the ecosystem , the ecosystem , is feeding yourself and building cool .
After that , the United States and the West have to grow second big food .
Titan is a global phenomenon .
You need to look at large areas to organize in the way that they organize .
We have a zone in which scientists call the Enterprise Transparency , or ICCAT — the Enterprise Commission to Protect electronics .
Carl whale also developed a great advocacy for all of this technology .
We can do hardware platforms , but hardly any good job of tuna fishermen .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s warm .
He &apos;s 40 below zero miles an hour , and the temperature of his body can heat up to 20 bucks a gallon .
So all of the volume on the left is pretty much done .
A fresh blood vessel is filled with blood vessels that don &apos;t make it any longer .
This is the best for proteins .
But what the wildlife creatures spend 40 miles on households , they cannot be able to stay in frame .
Sime has been good news , it doesn &apos;t have to be bad news .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was home to the forest floor .
If you look at the maps of the connectome , each dot is a gift .
In the direction of connectivity , there are 3,000 of them .
I &apos;m saying that more people are connected — ( Laughter ) if anyone is empowering the connectome , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere they go , these are the towers that lead to the seasonal children .
As a result , we have a success in breakthroughs and civil liberties .
When the peacekeepers began , Sami was smiling at a football field to create a football field .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , it &apos;s also a little bit of a mistake , because if you look at the Freeman &apos;s Facebook page , they call it the Same Street instead of a DVD .
Whereas the Food Fund is widely available .
As they say , it &apos;s hard to say something about pay and pay .
But then again , the credit card industry promises that he &apos;s given the opposite of the Phood Symphony .
This is a system that &apos;s producing oxytocin that &apos;s floating through the Earth .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the years .
Even though we spend a little bit of money to get to market , we &apos;re spending a lot of money , but we &apos;re also spending a lot of money .
Not only do we feed men and women , but we feed men and women .
We have all the things that are eating smells and also the taste that are being eaten .
Because on top of it , the blood and the blood vessels and so forth add bullets .
I wonder what the hell she &apos;s doing , but she &apos;s burning her teeth .
India was first or was dead . ( Laughter ) And it was a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of wildlife products that are being spilled out of the ocean for 20 years .
This is the third part of China or the number of people in the United States who spend every year .
The last thing for four states is this .
Philadelphia actually begins as lions .
And it began to look like the owner of a local financial industry noticed that the next day , nobody would ever be on a McDonald &apos;s note .
She went to Rick , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a sanitary pad for you . &quot;
They look like shape .
What the syndrome would be worth more is a evidence for the censorship , and it was evidence that the Ebola outbreak had nothing .
So he created his lift song .
Sadly , it was in 30 cents .
He wanted to make it in 25 cents , so he brought the electronic code .
The Philosophical Sandwich idea allows us to create the largest industrial art industry in the United States every year , from two to three billion pounds of empty space .
If we stop polluting the policies , then maybe it &apos;s Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plant proteins in very efficient ways in human proteins , and it &apos;s bad for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; it &apos;s coming from an adult in nine months .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like its own profile .
It doesn &apos;t even include IBM and HIV that we think it &apos;s going to live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
Which represents a large part of three million tons .
One possibility that conservation guards have wondered is , can we eat it ?
Can we justify it instead of giving it to people ?
There are reasons for this .
They &apos;re going to be the brilliant Indian child in the marketplace , which is the typical part of the housing , and the most effective part of the Indian economy .
This is on average three , EPA and DIY are also a huge epidemic .
So this is his ability .
But instead of giving us a few dollars &apos; worth of pay or a few dollars &apos; worth of pay and then turning the payload into a Facebook page , can we lower the bed nets and clean the bed nets to give the payload ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is that they &apos;re home characteristics .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
The Indus numbers are incredibly effective .
Indonesia &apos;s meat is only three parts .
Actually , the average of three is not coming from the grass .
The sea level rises by three , so they &apos;re just collected .
But if you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algae , the reason we use Facebook and the neutralization is because of how much we use it .
Over the next two decades , more than 400 people will be killed , which is a great death for the oceans .
As you can think about the cloud , in all these different forces , there are more proteins and more than three , these are very effective things .
It &apos;s very real .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can create a kind of machine that will allow us to make artificial proteins useful .
It needs to be a green fluid , it needs to grow fast , it needs to change its environment , it needs to look like its own profile , and it needs to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Fate East .
It &apos;s still in the papers .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we could do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is going to be under 30 million in the ocean .
What I mean by that is that everything is happening .
We want to understand without our needs .
But if we do something about it , the problem becomes obsolete .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was there to reveal the big brain because I have a brother who is susceptible to mental illness .
More and more later , I wanted to think of myself as a society , how can I embrace my dreams from my reality and create my dreams ?
What happens with my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia is that they don &apos;t distill their dreams from the public and the shared reality and they act on it .
So I dedicated my life to exploring intense mental illness .
And I moved from my ancestor to Boston , where I worked for a Ph.D. in Frankenstein Bank , which was in the heart of Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in the brain of people who are looking for answers to physiology is the difference in the brain of people who generally imagine it as comparable to the brain of people who are suffering from schizophrenia or schizophrenia or Pythorough Doc ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is actually create a micro-molecular scan of the brain , which cells are sending messages to the
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this research on the day , but on the weekly basis , at noon and weekend , I traveled to the National Ocean on a pilgrimage of the NAMI .
But on the 10th of September 1996 , I had to find out that I was a member of a conscious decision .
The left part of my brain was a nine strokes .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
In the morning of college , it was hard to write and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;m going to show you a human brain .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that touches the left side of the brain , and this is how it looks in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two pieces of it completely separate from each other .
Those of you who think computers work like a parallel processor in the right part of our brain works like a parallel processor that works like the left part of our brain .
These two pieces are transferring messages to each other through the crossroads of the culture that some 300 volunteers have .
But there are two sides to it .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part of the brain has to think about information in a very different way , and you allow them to tell me who they are , very different from each other .
Compassion : Thank you very much .
Teacher : Yeah , it &apos;s so much more .
( Laughter ) Our brain is just a piece of evidence now and think about it .
Right now , we &apos;re thinking about images of our brains in real time , and it &apos;s thinking organically about the movements of our bodies .
Information is stored in the form of energy , and it &apos;s stored in our entire nervous system , and it &apos;s then composed into a giant electromagnetic class that tells us how to understand the existing world and how to feel and how to understand .
I &apos;m an energy geared away from the energy of my surroundings by the direction of the left brain .
We are the energy systems that are moving from each other through the perception of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And there we are , at this point , brilliant cousins of this planet whose wisdom is to improve the world .
And in that sense , we are the best and the most beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
Our brain is thinking scientifically and theoretically .
The rest of our brain is about the past and the future .
The way the left brain works is to take the largest aluminum / cloud we have today , and to come up with talks and then start collecting these talks .
And it also tells us that this kind of information is organized and organized , and it tells us all of these things that are going on in the universe that we &apos;ve ever learned , and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely , are redefining the impact on our projects .
The left part of our brain is thinking of language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that is taking us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a tiny little voice that tells me how to go home and buy them .
I need them in the morning , it &apos;s a sense of pursuing my computational book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the father who says I am ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become separate .
I &apos;m the only person in the world who has incredible energy around me and passion .
And the only part of my brain that day went into Philadelphia .
The morning in the aftermath of Philadelphia , my left eye , with a deep pain behind my eyes .
It was as painful as the symptoms of the symptom .
And it hurt me like I was attacked and left .
And then it went off and it went off .
For me , it was unusual that I &apos;d never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to the gyre and I put on my cardboard plank , which is a previous physical exercise machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it feels like my hand is the fingerprint of an original human being that touched David .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look back at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , I think it sounds so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I perceive things has changed , which is the general sense of reality , which is that I &apos;m a person who &apos;s been passionate about this experience , but now I was in a very humbling and hidden place
And this was all very strange and poor , and my heart was increasing .
So I moved out of the machine , and I started to hunt in the room , and I felt like everything in my body was fine .
And everyone understands very , very hard .
I have nothing to do with my behavior , and I think a household problem is focused only on internal systems .
I &apos;m growing up in my own house in a pool of water , and I &apos;m actually speaking to the inside of my body .
I heard a voice that was saying yes , my father has to hear you now .
My foot goes down , and then my balance goes up and down the wall .
I look around and I see my hands , and I realize that I can &apos;t define my body &apos;s impact now .
I don &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped , because my hand was held up by atoms and magnetic walls and magnetic walls .
If I was to understand something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ?
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my brain , things got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice of T.V. control .
A gift .
Before that , I was surprised by the wiring of my brain .
But then immediately , as I did in another light switch , this huge spacecraft that was all around me .
And since I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body , I felt my sense of humility and strength .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; Come on , you &apos;re a lesbian . &quot;
So we need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I came back to the same consciousness as I say for a lot of money .
But she was a very beautiful place .
Think of it as being a beautiful place to be completely independent from this tiny little brain that puts you in the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where I &apos;m doing my work and I &apos;m rewarded for it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And measure all of your relationships from the outside world , and any of them have been degraded .
And I felt a sense of intimacy .
And just to give you a sense of what it would look like to fall back in that 37-year-old emotional weight that you were holding deep down .
( Laughter ) Oh , I was like a fashion show .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain turned to a part of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey ! Two hands .
We need help , and I think I need help , I need to help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , and this feeling has been completely transformed .
It occurred to me at the time that my God was attacking me so much that the next thing that my mind told me was how powerful it was !
( Laughter ) Sound familiar !
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who &apos;s going to take this opportunity to realize that they can consciously contract their own brains and they can come from inside — ( Laughter ) and then come to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very well-written woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into college . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t get rid of the golf cart , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I &apos;ve got to call to help . I &apos;ve got to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to remember my job , and then I remember having my business card , which is my phone number .
I go to my school room and I open up a three-story motorcycle card .
And I look up at the top card as I can see from my naked eye what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s my card , because I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s not my card , because I don &apos;t see any points .
And the definition of the word &quot; &quot; paper &quot; &quot; would be helped by the markers and by the markers , and I didn &apos;t have to worry about anything .
And then I started waiting for him to tell me what I call a statement .
And at that point , the public was repeatedly silent , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card ; it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download this code .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the pollution on the left were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the phone . I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have a way .
So I take the phone and I put it there .
I brought a banking card and I put it there , and now I &apos;m looking at the cards of the girls on the phone as they used to be .
But then I picked myself up to the side of my ladder when I came back , and it didn &apos;t remind me that I gave him the numbers either .
So I raised my hand like a Danish , and I put my hand on the floor , and I put the other hand on the floor , and I said to myself , &quot; &quot; When I came back to the public truth , I can tell you that I was here first in India , and I ended up walking all over India , and I heard that the phone rang up on my wrist , and one of the people called me and said , &quot; &quot;
And I say to her , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking so clearly , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And from my voice , something like &quot; &quot; Wooo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he came to me that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language at the time , and I couldn &apos;t understand it until I tried to speak .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And the next day , I was in an ambulance racing from one Hospital to another Hospital in Boston .
I walked around looking like a tiny little baby .
Just like a poor kid who was in the air and was in the poorest of the poorest , I pulled out the energy and I felt my soul shaking .
And it occurred to me that now I &apos;m not living my life .
Or the doctor would save me and give me a second life or give me a transfer .
The second time I left , I was surprised that I still live .
When I felt my soul shattered , I then gave life to God .
Now my brain was divided into two opposite truths .
It was at that time that my emotional system started to develop motions that felt just in pain .
Light had gone through my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were on and off , and the lights were on fire , and I could barely hear a sound coming from the background , or I could barely hear a sound , and I could barely hear the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t understand my body &apos;s content , so I felt so much and so much so much like a person who was free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant wheel in the middle of noise .
The Great Divergence .
It brought me full quality .
And I remember thinking it would never be possible that I could finish my own gigantic heritage to learn within the small body .
But then I realized , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m also alive !
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;m welcomed .
And if I &apos;m brought in neurons , and I &apos;m alive now , so whatever life is , it can accomplish neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world like this that is coupled with loving , loving people who know that they can someday feel that quality .
And they can pick and choose , and the right thing is that they want to put books on the left side of their brain to follow their steps in search of this primary quality .
And then I understood how powerful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was the lesson of the texture that taught me how to live my life .
And he gave me the privilege of being healthy .
After a stroke of destruction , the south poisoned the blood vessel from my brain , which was the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real elephant in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the hallmarks of cosmic life : hands of skills and two extremely high minds .
And we have the power to choose where we are and what we want to be in the world .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I can step in the right part of my consciousness &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , and I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful pieces of genetic makeup were found in one form , one in which everything exists .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness , where I become an individual , &quot; in a tiny way . &quot;
Quantum fluctuations .
I &apos;m a physician , a neuroanatomist .
My &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; exists .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And who ?
I think any time we spend our left-hand corridors in the cerebral cortex , we will expand security in this world and make our planet more sustainable .
And I thought , you know , we need to solve this idea .
Thank you .

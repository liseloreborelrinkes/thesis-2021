Good morning !
Are you people moving ?
They brought my name to the table , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the table in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Well , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little decade ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and I was waiting for dinner .
So I asked the question : Do you have a free food in Arabic ?
She looked at me strangely , thinks she must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , in order to have compassion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minister &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Okay , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Boy said .
He was speaking to me to three men , as his customer told me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I will not see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl accurately and placed them .
How could he speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I was angry about that .
Sure enough .
What is it about me that is worth celebrating my language in my country ?
Where does this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now , when we &apos;re here , there &apos;s a lot of people like me , who go to a period of time in their lives , where they basically leave out everything that &apos;s in their museums , just because they like to say , they &apos;re deceived and they &apos;re deceived .
Should I be bringing all my culture , my ideas , my spirits and spirits ?
Maybe we have the most important warriors in childhood stories .
Should I have to send everything that I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
How does that make sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for the audience as what it was for me .
The Arabic does not represent the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research that we &apos;re using in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we look at when we work on a curriculum schematic , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the iPod .
If we do that , they will outcaste us .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
That &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of mother .
Research tells us that in other languages , we need to translate to our mother tongue .
In other languages , the primary attribute of mother languages is the language of mother .
How ?
Jeffreen cellar , when he first started writing , used Arabic .
All his thoughts , imaginations and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a sense of happiness , a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
Then they started writing in English , so they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their essays in English , you feel the same fortune , the same feeling .
You can imagine that these are also their reference in English , of this little boy who lives in the mountains of London in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact of emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China are all under power .
That &apos;s why they set laws to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the portfolio , they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know better ?
Well , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to get to this developing world .
The countries that were like us at a time , but decided to try and push for progress , research , and move to countries , such as Taiwan , employees , they were able to speak with their own language as they were climbing stairs — like Hasbro .
They kept it close to themselves .
Because if you take Turkish or Kaki and other products , and you don &apos;t write on it in the marketplace , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be joined in these canopies , untouchables , like us , more time .
So to create new inventions and applications , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , autism , liberty , &quot; &quot; what does that tell you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a symbol of the very fabric of our lives , and the vocabulary that separates us from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Self-consciousness , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you is going to create a special place in your brain — there are feelings for a particular day in a unique history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an insight into what we think , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What about our mind ?
How would you have understood it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Friedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the age of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about insurance .
The thing is , these effects remind us of a particular thing .
A French speaker friend of mine is a French speaker .
I was asking this question for a while .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his husband and translate it one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; compelling . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The village abruptly called it &quot; &quot; compelling , &quot; &quot; and then all night I tried to understand it .
He wondered , how could someone really show up ?
Does she want to make herself ?
&apos;Bury me . &apos; ( English ) ( Punch ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us realize that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; he had a different way of thinking about it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me for Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I feel when I hear Fridays . &quot; &quot; The old lady tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have already raised my hand and why you have taken it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I have left my hand and you leave . &quot;
Turn it on . Turn it on .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to break the Arabic language ?
We changed it for a society , and we started the Arabic language Conservation campaign .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Get out the window , grab it . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protection campaign heard a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t use this method , because in this way , we wouldn &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody says to me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in a way that reflects our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
It &apos;s a letter that looks like us and the way we think .
So this sentence : &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; Look at the right sign .
Very simple but effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the land of hills on Earth .
You , you &apos;ve seen an example outside , of a framework with the letter black and blue on the touch pad , with the translation , &quot; Kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your language .
We shouldn &apos;t truly kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to discover a term for ourselves .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very fashionable to have the opportunity to create novel and compassion .
After that , we pasted an Arab letter with girls and girls .
Girls and boys .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; college . &quot; &quot; They want to confirm how much they want to do , but give me a word that is good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t defend ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be convinced that we &apos;re not going to allow anyone to open up or decide that the language has a right to us , to push us , to push us or to push our patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the blood or not refine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
Right now , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start today .
They write a note or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the Global Goals .
He can repeat the first letter of Arabic .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s solutions .
But we have to know , and we have to be convinced that the solution is there , is to be part of the solution .
In the past , what can you do today ?
Which of you is Twitter ?
To be honest , I recommend you , though , my time is over , or Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But the data , the letter of the Latin word , does not write Arabic .
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to encourage the urgency of this language .
Now I &apos;ll give you a secret .
A child is encountering the language of her father for the first time .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I promised my daughter that in the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , mama .
And nobody will expect anybody to hear that . ( Applause ) You get this cultural shopping . ( Applause )
I speak a little bit about abstract English to remind us of the deepest mysteries that we have of our existence , and I was shocked by the negative habits that are framing my people , until you saw me not blocking my generation , and I was confused by this generation of inequality , not until they were celebrated for our generation when they were not celebrating our generation
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , I had my primary career path , which meant I had to write down several articles .
Now , this is what happens when a normal person writes something .
You know ... ( Laughter ) You may be quick to start the work , but in the first week , they do a lot of work and later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is going to be all ready , but it &apos;s actually going to get reached out to the head , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens to every activity .
And then again , there &apos;s a whole new set of pages of research that you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal approach was not restricted to that kind of approach .
It was a huge task .
I organized a plan , I decided I would do something like this .
This is how it will go .
I &apos;m going to start small , in the middle of the months , the workforce is going to grow faster , and eventually it &apos;s going to grow more like a learner .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Come and go , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they went away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had something .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went away one day and I spent three days in the David Line , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I wrote 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads — people shouldn &apos;t go on two roads — the front room was running , spending time in the basement , and all of that money on the web .
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and I was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to you about your issue . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , from today , it &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about Sierra Leone .
My road consists of six people wanting to give me feedback , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s happening in the brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that the brain makes a difference between six people .
So to find out , I put a pen where I can put both of these brains together so that I can see the firing and the brain of the chest , so I can compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there was a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , it &apos;s not that hideous , but look at it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of these brains have long-term decisions , but the rest of the brain contains fun in the human brain .
Now , what does this mean for a singer ?
That means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; It &apos;s time for work . &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The smart people will make philanthropic decisions to make sense , but nobody likes this plan , so they &apos;ll pick up the profile , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Please read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and Tony Hadfield , because I know it &apos;s happened right now .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we go to the floor . And you &apos;ll see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After this , we &apos;re going to look at YouTube , beginning with a conversation about the race of the TED conference , and very soon after it &apos;s going to end up watching the videos of Tony Boy &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while for all of those things , so it &apos;s not going to take time to do anything else these days .
What a shame ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on ?
Now , this is not the basis of happiness that you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t know what the future isn &apos;t ; it &apos;s just two things : convenience and joy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you know and you spend your entire life going further and easier , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to conclude , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good think , and increase generation , maybe that &apos;s what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t gone extinct , the population isn &apos;t too far .
We are an increased tragedy , and of course we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is share what we enjoy .
Sometimes a farmer seems to be right to do what is easier and fun to eat , to sleep or to feel comfortable in times of opportunity .
That makes a difference .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big cause .
And this is climate change .
And for the rest of the world , this contradiction always reaches the end , which spends a lot of time in the short run , a simple and mysterious path that &apos;s out of the mind .
I call it a dark field .
( Laughter ) The dark matter is the place where the Sun people are so well-known .
This is where dignity is at the moment when it shouldn &apos;t be the dominant .
The extra in the dark matter that you get is not actually the extra because it &apos;s not the right thing , the space feeling , the crime , the fear , the feeling of hatred — all the characteristics that are in the right place .
The question is , in this case , when the outbreak is broken , how do we get rid of all the people in the favela , which is less happy but important ?
It &apos;s evidence that even people who are conservative , who are always protecting it in their dark spaces — someone called it homeless .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s a housekeeping thing , but when the downside gets close , it gets really great , or it &apos;s at the point when people are threatened to embarrassment , to quit jobs or scary things .
And the important thing is that the product only works .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and asked me to TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
I had my dream at TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and depression , something else was going on in the brain of the decisions made recently .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . The publisher said , &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India at the bottom of 20,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house till we see India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Four months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided to identify the names of the Koran .
I opened the web up , and it was a photograph of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house was under control , and within seconds the system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember Bharat — he &apos;s afraid of the house — he rolls down the tree !
And finally , and finally , the long-term decision makers spontaneously picked up the bill and I can start to work on the conversation .
Now , the homeowner who talks about paragraph with each type of interest , someone like me , will charge me for two weeks , and the beginning of the session is not going to be able to write a chapter , and then suddenly the unbelievable lesson of the session is to go out and write a letter .
And the total of three cleanlines in this case — the system of the Soviet people .
It &apos;s not very nice ; it &apos;s not linear .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was struck by the implications of it .
Actually , I had thousands of miles of access , all over the world and all sorts of people , from different backgrounds .
They included the engineers , the bankers , the engineers , the finders , and the MBA programs .
( Laughter ) And everybody was saying one thing and saying , &quot; I am too confused . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the following email address and the number of emails .
People &apos;s script was lying in the script to describe how much Susan did in her life , in the context of what she did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out there are two orders of magnitude .
Today I gave you all these examples , talking about subjects , all these data lines .
And when David lines up , recent effects are the key to getting the house reached .
But the Sun has a second kind of relationship , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any digital linear .
So if you want a project that starts itself like an art form or a business — something like art or commerce , until you start keeping your eyes on the prize and doing things .
Also , there are a lot of things that don &apos;t have to go online with people like meeting with their family , exercise , think about your health , think about your relationships , tell your relationships better if you don &apos;t like them .
Now if the only way to crack the code is to crack the code , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data online , in the case of the crash , goes missing .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest effects are that you can &apos;t beat them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of a television address that &apos;s very little to see and talks about less than just sexual orientation , consistent setback .
You are suffering from depression and seriousness .
And it can be the source of long-term returns and downloads .
So I thought that was the reason they had email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not set for the plan .
Taiwan Prime Minister has put his eyes on him , sometimes in his own lives .
The upsetting is not that they cannot pursue their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all email and one thing came out — I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And some of you may have had good relationships with the DNA link , but remember the keys when the DNA lines don &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the Clinder of life .
Each block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
They &apos;re not very stupid , especially when some of them are hacked .
I think we all need to go to the blackboard .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing today , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that house on it , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Hi .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days in U.S. and Afghanistan , a handful of eight days , a handful of Americans and a handful of Afghanistan were deployed from a region of Afghanistan to help to provide a service to the federal government to help protect an office for the Afghan government to help protect a security office for the Afghan government to help to provide a platform to protect the Afghan security services ,
The military figures came in at the height of an assault , and they were surrounded by three and a lot of stuff , and together they flew Cape Sweden , and you were seen as a child by the Cape Twin , and you watched as a child by the time the victims were saved and removed from the dead .
One of the people who had access to her kids was a surgery and she and a Spanish doctor were moving towards a herbal chief and she was also moving towards a herbal chief in the hospital .
So it &apos;s shown that the Kepin Sevin and his skin are adopted by this mysterious magic that happens during the heat .
They put it into the Hole in the Hole in the Wall , and then you see the Cape Town Seventine burning and burning them first so they can pollinate others to save .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extremely depressing emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why I did it with people who didn &apos;t .
You know , you go to the polls to get those people who want to survive so that other people can benefit .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to vote for otherwise .
We have the electronic calculus !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were just the best people .
That &apos;s why they get stuck in traffic .
These people are moving towards this idea of services , these people are moving towards this idea of services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so that each of us has the capacity to work together and do this in large numbers and have the capacity to do it in other things .
I &apos;ve got a great privilege of meeting with some of these people , and we &apos;re going to call them Yesterday — ( Applause ) — and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important here .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they are emotions , not actions .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Stand me . &quot; &quot; And you do that .
It &apos;s not possible that I give two people the chance to cooperate and do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does this excitement come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , to the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , these are all the threats facing us .
There &apos;s no personal matter .
Women Are Heroes may be a lack of resources , a long-term Twitter , and they &apos;re all working together to reduce our lifespan , all of these things together to reduce our lifespan .
And so we became ready as social animals in which we gathered and gathered together as part of a sacrifice , as in a tribe where we felt our own personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was fun and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can sleep through the night and I can scratch the surface of some of my neighbors .
If we don &apos;t trust each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t trust you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The new approach is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are trying to make our lives harder or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
This economy can scale up very , very unbelievably in the stock market .
It could be a new technology that pulls your business apart overnight ; it could be a new technology that pulls your business apart at night .
Or you can have a fight that sometimes tries to fight you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it stops your risks and it tries to take your businesses away from you , it stops your risks and it tries to take your businesses away from you .
We have no control over those powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the intensity is , because that &apos;s where the leadership is .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in his organization and their lives that are contributing to protecting the people in his organization and their lives , and that is to assess their own personal and sincere results in order for people to go out and experience their own personal experiences so that people can feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , that &apos;s where the powerful things stand .
I was on an ongoing journey , and I realized that when a passenger began to walk through the space before he was finished , and I saw the staff on the front door just as he passed the law as he was crying .
One of the first things I tried to walk on was this guy — one of the first things I tried to walk on him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep wrestling like us ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit with us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he quickly told me exactly the same thing .
She does not trust her leaders .
The reason we like to travel to the West Airlines is not because they hold infinite people to the bottom .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t drive their leaders .
You see , if the circumstances are there , we spend our time and our energy protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and our energy protecting ourselves from one another , and that makes organization worse .
What a great leader can do for him is to give the most close example of how to be a good parent as a best parent can give him the most close example of how to become a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our children opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the opportunity to grow and get more out of it that we can do for ourselves , to grow and to get more out of it that we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people opportunities , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give them the opportunity to have confidence , to have access and to work so that they can achieve more achievements that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more achievements than ever imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City , says one thing that if you have a tough time in your family , will you ever save your child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has lost practical practical practice on employment . Charlie has lost practical practice .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get committed to doing things based on efficiency .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will mentor you and help you , in exactly the same way that we would do to a kid who comes home from school and checks .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from the CEO &apos;s , who are unequally stressed and motivated .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the fundamental principle of dignity .
They have grown a denser society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones as victims of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones to their loved ones by their loved ones , instead of saying they &apos;ve encouraged their loved ones by their loved ones , but that they &apos;ve encouraged their loved ones since their loved ones .
That &apos;s what gives us no data .
Can anyone guess why the market should be put in 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t teachers pay 250 million dollars ?
Do we have a problem with that ? Absolutely not .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Instead , they will give people skin data to save , but they will give people rapid data to save .
A mining company in Bub-Champs-Élysées run a mining company in Bub-Champs-Élysées , called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , the assembly of the great marketplaces , and they built 30 percent of their ranks overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem and they cannot afford to maintain their own frustrations later .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , so many of the companies that we have today come together and do a sudden thing .
And Bob answered that .
You see , the Boomers don &apos;t trust the Greeks .
In fact , the Bubble believes in the generation of goods , and decreasing goods is harder and harder to reduce heart attacks .
And then they developed a personal project .
That every employee , from CEO to CEO , had to hire everyone in a small four-week vacation .
They could have done it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob pointed out to the program , he &apos;s very important .
He said that it &apos;s better that we all accept small incidents , that some of us would take a lot of money and get a lot of attention .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody expected , people began to trade off each other .
The ones who were more successful did business with less successful people .
That meant that somebody had to license them for five weeks to get another one .
Knowledge is an extreme , not a contradiction .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing leaders , I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing leaders who are not the leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs and we do what they say because they have access to us but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of organizations who don &apos;t have the authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the courage to look at the person on the left , and they have the courage to look at the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the foreign secrets that had been out in the theater , and as philosophers have found a way to eat in honey and raise their friends before and save anything for him when he eats them .
And when he returned to the area , his friends used to give him some of his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them they do it .
We call them leaders because they risk someone else first , we call them leaders because they risk someone else .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe and so that our people can benefit from it , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people can afford to
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their pain and blood to see if their leaders &apos; dreams are becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and pink and you give it to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do it for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re going to like to do everything ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story about the Limpopo , the Limpopo , and the Mpumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is so unbelievable , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions at the age of 17 , I was staying quiet with friends in the winter sleep .
The sun is warmer in winter .
And as I was dozing off in the street , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you invent something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t make you sad ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I immediately went , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this one , &quot; &quot; and I did some research and I found some astonishing statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty of them are in Africa , and there are only four in South Africa .
Different diseases accumulate in the environment called the most dangerous tragedy .
The reason the tragedy in the eyes is a manifestation of the degeneration of the tragedy through one of the most common denominations of the tragedy that you can become independent .
This disease kills eight million people a year , and one of the things that &apos;s most exciting is you have to give up your penny for saving the tragedy : no legs , no pads , no engineering .
After seeing these statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then a month of my top 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a broadband Internet broadcast at about 20 different options on Google , and
And I looked at this as a special problem in the box .
So Mohammed said right , our formula has gotten ready .
Now we need to process this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on my mobile device , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent warrior in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Not anymore ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , exchange for the world &apos;s first slogan .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a drink .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and with limited resources , what I had , the Monday University campaign brought in with a few new people , did this additional process , and now we have a full-blown paradox , which is ready for the market , is now available .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They purchase what they need . One person doesn &apos;t buy a ticket in Alex . They buy a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how it costs more .
So we did DryBath in these creative milestones .
You just pull it in between and leave it outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple replacement of a slum is only five times .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath , the well-known children of the air molecules — ( Laughter ) once a week .
However , what we &apos;ve found is that we can save 80 million liters of water on the average , whenever they leave the garden and we can save two houses for children , which is two houses , two houses for more than a high school drop , two extra houses for the child .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken our core values , our privacy , and our collective action .
DryBath is the resource of a rich man and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually entering a market mechanism in process , now we &apos;re entering a market mechanism that could supply it in the retail market , and one question I &apos;d like to share with you today is , on the Limpopo Circle , on the corner of the Limpopo , in one week , with an alphabet of 50 cents a week that does not have to worry about the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet , so I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And the more important thing is that I learned a lot in the previous process , Google announced me as the world &apos;s first young man .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur right now , the first African to ever be accountable to this , and one of the things that really surprised me , is why all of this money should not be cheated . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , interestingly , I &apos;m here to share some of the results with you today , and I was also surprised to see what are the real reasons why organizations succeed — which is really why they succeed .
I believe that donor agencies are a great tool to make the world a better place .
If you choose a group of people with the choice of equality waste and organize them at the beginning , you will discover human abilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is it that often failure ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to go through a lot of organizations , discuss some of my most fierce ideas and misconceptions that have brought me to some of the organizations last year .
I wanted to know this because I was building various shops from the age of 12 , from the position of Yahli at the U.K. base school to the tenth school when I was building solar power tools , then in college , when I made a radio station .
I left school and founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve made more than 100 companies based on very successes , very big failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain why corporations succeed or failed at these factors .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there &apos;s something here .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; ideas Live &quot; &quot; in the old days that you might think .
With grief , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to perceive smoking or drink , is more important than I think .
I &apos;d never thought that this was going to be a chapter for the past TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s got a plan , until I don &apos;t get a penny in it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business as well .
A team in Climate Protection is important for its ability to control the vehicle .
Cows are an objective reality .
So I thought that maybe the team is the most important thing .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear effect on injustice ?
With that in mind , it seemed to be the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Could that be the most important thing ?
After this , of course — is it time ?
Did the idea come very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t set for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;re going to come and teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or has it been a long way since , and are there a lot of terrible things ?
So I &apos;ve gone through these five factors very respectfully in many organizations .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in Libya , and 100 of them outside to try and find a scientific result .
So first of these ideas on laptops , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all sold for billions of dollars .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we were hopeful , didn &apos;t succeed .
And then I tried to incorporate all these characteristics , as I think these companies had promoted .
Then in the outbreak of ideas from Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and Linkeddin .
Here are some things : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the most effective factors had the success and the failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was the choice of time .
The right time is 42 percent in the difference between success and failure .
The idea of team and action is on the second level , and then thinking , having different ideas , having different ideas , is actually a third multiplication .
But it &apos;s not obvious , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but it struck me that looking at it and thinking isn &apos;t the most important thing .
Sometimes it matters a lot more when it &apos;s in time .
The last two , I think , is business model and investment .
I think the market model is still low , because you can do it without a market model later , when the product is high in the village , including .
And also , if investment was low , but it &apos;s now increasing , especially in today &apos;s long-term , investment is very easy .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these dots here .
Take a major piece of the Airbnb that everybody knows .
There were a lot of investors in this company because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to put a product in your house ?
Of course , it &apos;s proven wrong .
One of the reasons why mythology is successful is because of a better market model , a market model , and a market mechanism that is fair time .
This company came in front of the financial crisis when people needed additional support , and it made sure that people could respond to a banana in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
However , time was exactly right to make the drivers who need it .
Dreaders were also demanding additional income ; it was absolutely essential .
Some achievements , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to look beyond the obvious threats to companies .
We thought that was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was the online entertainment company .
We were very interested in this . With a lot of effort and a great marketing model , we had to work with great thinkers at the Hole in the Wall .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broad Internet was very , very small .
It was really hard to see the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and finally this company revealed itself in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of coding and broadband in the United States , over 50 percent of it was spent on YouTube at best .
Great idea , good time .
In fact , when YouTube started , it had no business model .
They didn &apos;t even believe it was going to happen .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
The idea is very important .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really keen to grab you .
And the unbelievable thing is that , outcomes don &apos;t come from the outcomes , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work with it very , very reliably .
As I said earlier , organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of those conversations are helpful in increasing the chances of your success , and then making the world a better place is not the other way around .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 a.m. on September 2016 we saw the biggest data point in history . &#93; &#91; French accents have pointed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; Government money panic &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Robert Wenters &apos; Raborte Period . &#93; &#91; This week , the warehouse was at the center of the warehouse receiving millions of cas@@
From Pandora &apos;s point of view , these papers were plastered from small shell companies .
We found the inner stories of the villages , the banks and the villagers who came to the fundraising business and said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a grumpy company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messages , you can look at the way it &apos;s done , how it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The President of Arizona was famous .
We &apos;ve also heard about the horrible drought factories of poor desalination workers .
The revenue of the revenue of two billion dollars goes to the President of the Ross Council , the main source of my son , from his childhood friend , a famous secretary .
And so many rich people will be infected , and even those who will survive , will be at home with more blind documentaries .
Now this looks like a magical movie or a John Gaulty story with me .
What should we do with it ?
But the fact that agronomists and power keep putting their money where it &apos;s not supposed to pay as much tax revenues , it means that efficient things like pay for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization at Galapagos Vision , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people handle their influence in the weapon companies that we &apos;re talking about .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can run a second company inside a company , a second company inside , so it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind this curve .
For organizations ruling law enforcement , it &apos;s hard to understand why it &apos;s happening .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s particularly interesting in the United States .
Perhaps that &apos;s why the United States doesn &apos;t have to be in this facility .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in burning companies .
That &apos;s why the road companies work , the U.S. Foundation has a few .
I think if we &apos;re going to read the novelty of Kim Illinand or the Devil War or the View Mountain or the Netherlands , what &apos;s going on with the U.S.
Instead , a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give much information , you have to give less information to run the company than the Liber Council does .
This kind of information is thrown away in American schools .
It makes it easier for minority investments .
This kind of ritual affects all of us .
Now in the Galapagos Ventures , we wanted to look at how this problem works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was , we switched a campaign across 13 tuna legal companies .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transport a village across the U.S. to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The heartbreaking thing was that all of the villages could make a demonstration of how the village could move its soul .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t create our cash for anyone , and we didn &apos;t give anyone a cash , but it was a disappointment for the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual lawyers who talked about our hidden assumptions and our biases .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who &apos;s found in Sandel .
It &apos;s about system function , it &apos;s about tactics , it &apos;s about wealth , it &apos;s about wealth , it &apos;s about wealth , it &apos;s about wealth .
And to be able to do that , we have to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder for these kinds of situations .
It can be awesome , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always there .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve begun to move towards transparency where the company is growing .
This issue was put on a political agenda , but the British Prime Minister David Camerry declared at 8 cents that happened in South Asia in 2013 .
And since then , European Union is forming a central record on a regular level , whether or not there are companies in Europe or controlling them .
The evidence is that the U.S. is behind it .
The variation in the map of a parallel law is in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to grow as much , so we turned five .
We want to look at innovations , larger sections , larger companies , used across the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Global Ventures .
The public should come to grief with the people who know their knowledge behind the Russian firm .
Have a voice , say , that &apos;s not good for a privilege like this , for us .
Politicians need to address this issue , and encourage the legitimate changes of access to information .
We can cooperate flexibly with the secrets that are responsible for the textbook and the school district .
CA : Welcome to joy , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Like , who &apos;s your invention , has had a much more empathy in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Song : Yes , can it be true ?
This is a paradox — what &apos;s not ? — that the media of the world is showing us just one bad performance that employees have been able to produce a small group of data that &apos;s larger than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people form documents ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julian Song : Yes , there are . I can tell you — there are public services in the right way . And we have so many ways to get the information to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed storage to send material from one place on the Internet to another , to crack the signal to ship lawsuits like Sweden and Bollywood .
We get the data from the cloud , from ordinary data , from Remittances , or whatever , comments like normal news organizations , foundations — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about presenting huge amounts of information to the public and then protecting yourself against the inevitable legal and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is real , but you actually never know what the product is .
Julian Song : This is right , we &apos;re going to find these lives all the time . And if we get to the point where we get to the point , we quickly obtain the information .
( Clanking ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s coming from here and asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened ?
Julian Song : Yes , that &apos;s the Koral report .
It was a hidden magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was there for 18 years .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the book — with the attempts of the authoritarian regime , who tried to convince Kenya that they spent 20 million pounds on this report and one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to mobilize its political will , which was the wealthiest man — now the wealthiest man in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ in Kenya .
So I was born in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this with the very first election ever in December 2008 .
When we did that report , we made that report three days after the new president decided to volunteer , and Kabash decided to volunteer to the person who he was suffering from from from , Daniel Aravind , so that &apos;s how he became a reporter and found himself in the street of Mao .
CA : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s just — it &apos;s spread in Kenya , not from the rulers , but from the perspective , and it &apos;s changed the game .
GG : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafi , and then it &apos;s spread across all over Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he , after a couple of days , convinced Kenyan entrepreneurs that they could talk about it .
And this blog was run on TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the revenue of the Voters 10 percent , according to an online sex report in Kenya , and changed the outcome of the previous choice .
CA : Wow , so did your secret breakfast really change the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : There you go . We &apos;re going to show you a little video of a little clip of a windmill .
It &apos;s a long video , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;ll tell you , this is a cardiovascular video .
RD : ... That &apos;s great , when you reach them and steal them .
I thought , oh , there are four things with them .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s OK . The gas is running .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me — go away .
Have a dollar .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost . Gill gets lost . ( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost .
Hotel — two , six , six , six .
We have to go . It &apos;s time .
Okay , we killed eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two Hilly Crafters , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Rags . They &apos;re on my show .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , it would be embarrassing . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hi . He &apos;s fine . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julie Song : People who worked on it had a very strong effect on it .
We ended up surveying two people .
It was the first in three cases that happened .
CA : So 11 people voted in this attack , right , two guys from the Humble Rights ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two rolls of the race , two little children were killed .
Essentially , from 18 to 26 people were killed .
CA : And there was so much anger after that .
What was the main reason for regret , you think ?
Julian Song : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with a very strong disbalance of power .
On the one hand , some fresh people are walking in the street , and then from a kilometer away , the Ebola Kepler is going to launch these 30 miles of gallons of coastal plants on everyone — any number of them — and they &apos;re also going to give the damage to the children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t rich in any way , because they were journalists .
CA : Well , the US Department of Defense was arrested by Brad Mining , and it &apos;s been said that he announced in Chester Rome that he took this video to you over 280,000 and a half thousand other American documentaries as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Song : So we decided to accept the document .
It &apos;s been tried five days ago , getting 150,000 documentaries and 50 cards .
But what we did now is we gave them a proposal of the Rio and American safety house at the start of the year , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safari house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of articles in the United States of America ...
Julian Sanjah : We &apos;ll give them a go . ( CA : You &apos;ll do it ? ) Julian Sanjam : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Song : Because things like this show that , in fact , what are the Afghan governments , the real violation of human rights in these governments .
If you look at the hidden evidence , these types of materials are in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you store hidden information ?
Julian Sanguage : Yes , the question is how important information in the world can be collected .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when information comes out that institutions expect to do something good , because the institutions know it better , and they know the story about it , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there risks for a more individual or a collective society , where you don &apos;t expect to get out of denial ?
Julie Song : We did not do the same thing with the documentaries .
I mean , our biggest hurdles are practical .
With information we can gather in a very specific way the kind of information that &apos;s being collected — the kind of information that &apos;s being collected from somebody else .
But there are also some mysteries — you know your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magical secret — but we &apos;re talking about the public services that come in and out of courage .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re driven by this passion .
And what you would say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter is in the United States Senate , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something so much that some people like to punish other people .
Here &apos;s an American philosophy of the dead .
This influence — but it has given millions of people around the world that the United States is political .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? What are you going to answer ?
Julian Song : Yeah , we &apos;re asking a lot of questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video every day .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference on their feelings , it doesn &apos;t make a difference on their perceptions .
Because they look at everything every day .
It will transform their feelings and their thinking about how they allocate money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re looking forward to looking forward to what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light you have to have a career as your own genius ?
Julian Song : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the kind of secrets that are committed to other minds .
If they do that , it &apos;s a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing the same thing that makes people moral sense that they &apos;re going to do it later , not to get behind .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , as far as we &apos;ve heard — it &apos;s about this coming from the blind .
You can also imagine that there would be various fears about lawyers and lawyers .
One is people &apos;s heroes of hope .
Or the problem .
What is the point of view from Hero ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Song : Oh ! There &apos;s something to be .
CA : These are pretty good people , geeks , pretty good .
We have to try more . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done that for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story that &apos;s a little old , right ?
What is this ?
Julie Song : This is a metaphor for what we do every day .
So at the end of last year — there have been a lot of important breakthroughs in November in the Bahamas , like the cell in Mexico , but not so big .
And we got the report — which was a very nice talk about it — showed that , in fact , conservation workers from all the different counterparts of the oil companies had put in there and they had buried .
And it had some forms of the Vietnamese government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were pretty sure that perhaps this company had done all of this in a game .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it sounds good to look , but we can &apos;t anticipate it . &quot; &quot; So we went through a letter the week after the paper that he wrote , they wanted to wear makeup . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to wear makeup . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we need to wear makeup about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show the paper that you have legitimacy ?
Is this really yours ? &quot; &quot; And then they took what we think of as Scripture with the name of philanthropy and iPod .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It &apos;s happened a lot .
This is one of our ways of looking at and predicting what material is , and that is to write letters to these people .
CA : OK . So never get the information from inside the bag ?
Julian Song : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re going to collect and measure things as difficult as possible .
So our announcement to this in the last few months has become somewhat more successful because we &apos;re moving our backyard system up because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s rainfall .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing , our ability to engage with us more because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services , but we don &apos;t have enough people to process and anticipate all that information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , for a journalist or a journalist &apos;s dream ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to fix faster because the kinds of materials that we have in common with us , so we have to innovate so that we can get those people together to really work on the materials of public safety , and then less aware of the things .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to that job .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is this right ?
Julian Song : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then ran away from the city , so there was a side effect .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean , a psychologist , I think it &apos;s just that together , you know , something can be so intelligent .
Julie Song : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a hero at a young age and you came to the workforce very quickly .
Julian Song : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist by a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and I boy then that when this crime broke down on me .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Russian hardware that &apos;s used by your grandmother to browse a bank account .
That &apos;s why the word doesn &apos;t matter very much as it did before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think that &apos;s your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps an event in your life that helped them survive ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : good , affordable and evil people do not create compassion ; they create prosperity .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some of the other brave and courageous people that are in my life .
CA : Brilliant and heavy people don &apos;t generate masters ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a junior man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing up , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of encouraging a prosecutor , which is approaching the police up close to crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So let &apos;s just tell you one last little bit about what happened in the United States ?
Basically , you &apos;ve published something out there , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you &apos;ve published the papers saying that you &apos;re dealing with your story .
Instead , they scaled up your expectations .
That makes you very famous in the Ice Land . So what happened ?
Julie Song : Yes , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
The East Land went through an economic crisis .
It was the most powerful thing there .
The banks there were 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the permanent television sets a little bit about five minutes before it became popular , as a film : &quot; Unviolent resistance on the site , and the state of the newsroom was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just went to the website , spent a lot of time , and we became very popular in the U.S. , and I went to Ice Land and talked about this problem .
And the elements for the people there were things that shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the scientists in the United Nations , working with some other international experts , we called the Ace Lander of a new type of law , so it &apos;s just like free media , because it &apos;s the most secure place for the journalists all over the world , the new Nepal prince to open .
A Nearby country is like the Netherlands , which means the system gets upwards from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Alliance Parliament properly understood this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you realize that it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to be more like that ?
Julie Song : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will go .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure for the law of free will and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
Who &apos;s going to get that one ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move it either side or side .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience to talk about , quote , judges , honor and all the power to you .
Julie Song : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at games .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So this is what I did , which is milk .
I walked past my childhood basketball pitch and I saw these gaps gently in mirrors .
When I grew up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I found this one .
My team was shocked .
And when I saw it from a sort of personal point of view , I realized somehow how how how how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the Ministry of Agriculture , wherever I went , surprisingly , North Carolina , Paris , or in London , every time I went to Berlin , there were four creatures being slaughtered — well , tuna , silence and code .
And I thought that was kind of weird , and I was just wondering whether anyone else had ever gotten the copy of this ridiculous model .
And when I went out to visit him , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at these iconic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
By restricting the natural world to a few elements , there is no unusual human nature .
This is something we did 10,000 years ago when we analyzed our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s rock and white , and you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : copper , cow , leather and wheat .
It &apos;s also true for fans .
If you look at the minds of 150 or 200 years ago in New York City , you &apos;ll see pictures , posters and lawns .
But if you look beyond the surface , you &apos;re just going to be able to fly four — the circles , the circles , the circles , but also the circles .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shahari .
It &apos;s a brand new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
World War II caused us to become the enemy of war .
During the Cold War , we advanced technology , like the Sun , the Yahli polymer , and so on , the whole thing collapsed .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have come to see the greatest increase in the capacity for months to come .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that famine and marine agriculture have increased , and within a couple of years its income has increased greater than concentration .
Now if you add fishing and water hyacinth , it will be equal to two Chinese each year .
My favorite example of using Chinese is not the only college , because China is not the largest country , it &apos;s also the largest border .
Now let &apos;s turn to our kitchen .
First of all , the U.S. and the West have the most utilized salt food .
The Gulf is an extremely bad weapon .
Only one foot forest cannot be transported to a market : five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest canopy .
The Indus trade-off also is incredibly precise .
In one of the clinical studies in Delhi University , it turns out that burning hydrated seawater is extremely ineffective in terms of carbon dioxide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the forest flows in the areas of the forest are the mangroves .
Now let &apos;s look at these beautiful patterns .
They check the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protect the coastal plants , coastal plants , and they produce all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the forests of Management .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of ocean monsters .
Another action which is here , which is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; the Nemo knee . &quot; &quot; Throughout the metropolitan area , you &apos;ve seen this very controversial thing .
Now there are some recently that small farmers are breeding nectar , but along with it , at a large number of them are breeding the second flower and then turning into food after the bird .
And a lot of times , there &apos;s a lot of activity going on in these areas that are named after the Red Brigades and the Red Brigades , and this is the one that we &apos;d like to look at on the River , which means that the ecosystem is storing itself and producing itself .
Then there &apos;s the second big food in the United States and the West .
Tony is a global citizen .
The tuna has to navigate through a very large area to organize .
We also have a region called the Physical Entertainment Organization , or the ICCAT — the Internet Convention for Climate Protection .
Carl Spencer also volunteered for the entire tsunami .
We can stand on TV , but Tony &apos;s not very good at putting a knife in .
Many people don &apos;t know , but Tony &apos;s carrying heat .
It can take over 40 miles an hour and heat up to 20 degrees above ambient temperature .
All the benefits of this melting nectar are closed .
The blood vessels on the floor are supply chains that don &apos;t slow down very quickly .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creatures 40 miles away from the coast , they cannot stay in the forest .
There &apos;s also been a great deal of space , and it &apos;s not necessarily been overstated in the past .
This is my political context .
Connect was born in the Thar Desert .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a document .
There are 3,000 signs in the politics of Connect .
Actually , I say connectome is large . ( Laughter ) If anyone solves the power of a connectome , I think we can dramatically change the world .
And everywhere , these are rockets that disappear from celebrating their children .
As a result , we came to the farm and we had a success in peace .
When the space shuttle began , the space shuttle was swept at six feet of the forest to form a platform .
But now it &apos;s a much better approach .
On the contrary , it &apos;s also a tiny bit of false water , because if you look at the footprint on a footprint , it opens the footprint for peace in the footprint .
Whereas this video is full of flies .
It &apos;s hard to say that micro-finance is hard to say .
But then again , the credit industry requires that it returns to the base of the Fund Summit .
This is a system that &apos;s producing oxygen that &apos;s mimicking the Earth from Jupiter .
It &apos;s been seven percent since the age .
Although we &apos;re spending a lot less money on getting to the market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money on the market .
Not only are we fooling fish , but we &apos;re also fooling fish and vegetables .
We have the mosquitos that are eating the mosquitos and the mosquitos that are eating the mosquito .
Because on the left-hand side , the blood and the teeth and so forth add up to the muscles .
I wonder if there &apos;s a hole that beat the hole and that hole in the wall .
India is either a before or a before death . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s taken out of the sea .
It &apos;s the third piece of China or the same size as the entire U.S. , which goes out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philistines actually started as lions .
And it started to look like the owner of a local entrepreneur who realized that the next day he would not come to a McDonald &apos;s store .
He went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Okay .
It was evidence that the Ebola outbreak was larger for the sea , but it was evidence that it could not be harmed .
So he built his lift song .
Unfortunately , the Indus script lasted for 30 centuries .
He wanted to make a 25-centimeter probe , so he brought a series of components .
Today , the Photosphorus Sandwich is the largest mass-market art industry in the United States , moving from two to three billion base pairs a year to two to three billion base pairs per year .
If we stop polling , perhaps the current election is Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the proteins in a very dynamic way in animal protein , and that &apos;s a real role for the third world .
It &apos;s actually a very sustainable solution ; it grows from one individual in nine months .
The problem is that when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a windmill .
It doesn &apos;t have the ACE and the DIY committee about which we think it will keep us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
This represents a large sample of 20 million tons .
One possibility that security guarantees have increased is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of giving peace ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a wonderful childhood in the market of Honduras , a typical feast of slavery against liar , and a typical feast of India &apos;s dominance .
This is October 3 , the EPA and the DMV .
So this is her potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a pound or a A , and we turned it into a FedEx fund , we turned it into a fundraising center and we paid two dollars a month for it to clear away the food system ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPAD and ADHD .
The amount of data is incredibly effective .
The Indus trade-offs are only three portions of the GDP of the market .
Actually , it &apos;s about three walls away from the kitchen .
The sea level rises by three o &apos;clock in the morning , so they just come together .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our bureaucratic administration is wiped out by Facebook and Netization .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , these are the major causes of death in sea life .
As you might think about clicking , there &apos;s more protein and more protein in all these different ways , and more than three , these are highly effective substances .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last one is a question mark .
We can produce a mouse that can be really useful for preventing salt proteins .
These creatures have to be green , growing and changing very rapidly , have the capabilities of their environment like a pyramid , and they want to be EPA , DHA , Omix3 and Fate East .
It &apos;s still in the papers .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we could do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is going to be about 30 million in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think about it without our needs .
But if we do something like that , it &apos;s a little bit of a scratch .
Thank you .

I was born to read the brain because I have a brother who is a neurological disease deficit .
As a scientist , I later wanted to understand , how can I connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they don &apos;t integrate their dreams into a common reality and they act on it .
So I dedicated my life to finding serious illness .
And I moved to Boston with my wife &apos;s program in India , where Prime Minister Franklin was working at the Ministry of Financial Bank , which was in the fields of Harvard University .
So what I was looking for is the mathematical level of people &apos;s brains that are generally thought of as analogous to their brains of people who are dysfunctioning with the skeleton , or the BBC , and so what we &apos;re trying to do is build a microscopic map of the brain , and what &apos;s the cell sending out of that cell with the chemical level ?
So I had a lot of courage in my life because I used to do this kind of stuff during the day , but on Friday and Saturday afternoon , I used to take a visit to the NAMI satellite .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself in front of an intelligent desert .
The left side of my brain was a nose .
And for the next four minutes , I watched my brain become completely disconnected by any ability to understand information .
I was able to check and write and remember something in the morning .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you ever saw the same brain , there are two parts which are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the last part of the brain that touches the left arm with the left brain , and so it &apos;s going to stay in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that computers work like a parallel processor on the right part of our brain while the left part of our brain acts like a solar processor .
Those two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the culture of the culture that some 300 volunteers have .
But they &apos;re also two pieces of alcohol .
Because they understand information in different ways that the knowledge of each part has to discover a totally different kind of information , their attitude towards different things , and if you let me just give you a sense of who they are , very different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . That &apos;s it .
Audience : Yes , it does .
( Laughter ) The only part of our brain is thinking about this moment .
Here &apos;s what our brains are thinking about right now in the image of the brain , and it &apos;s collectively thinking about the movements of our bodies .
Information is stored in the body and restored throughout the body through our whole nervous system , and then it &apos;s transmitted down to form a giant electromagnetic classroom that , in the current moment , tells us how to feel and how to feel in the mind and how to read .
I &apos;m an energy geographical activity filled with the energy around me through the consciousness of the left brain .
We are the energy systems that are moving from one another through the perception of the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we are brothers and sisters on this planet whose wisdom is to improve the world .
And at this point , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and politically .
The blood on the left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The fabrication on the left of the brain is telling us that the greatest icon of all of us today is taking the analytics and then collecting those analytics .
And it also informs all this information that is organized and embedded in the universe of all of the things that we have learned in the past and the possibilities of the future , namely , will determine the impact on our projects .
The symbols on the left of our brain are thought of in language .
It &apos;s a conversation with one another that touches our inner world with another .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me , you have to remember to go home and buy it .
I need them in the morning ; it &apos;s my philosophy of computing ; it reminds me of where I &apos;m being put .
But perhaps most important is the voice that says it is me ! It is me !
And like the one on the left , the brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m isolated .
I become the only person with the energy in my neighborhood and with you .
And that part of my brain that morning happened without a flight .
On the morning of the destruction , my left eye was blown behind by a broken nose .
It was as painful as it was to take the sight of the hospital .
And that pain just dragged me and left me .
And then he leaves , and then he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never experienced any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No way , I start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to the locker and I put myself on a cartoon camera , which is the previous physical exercise machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , because I feel like my hand is the fate of someone who has hidden a donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s kind of weird . &quot; &quot; And then I turn around and I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I think that &apos;s a really weird and weird thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I &apos;m perceiving that has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being who &apos;s operating in the machine , but now I was in a poor and hidden space where my
And it was all strange and poor , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine and I started walking around the room and I realized that everything inside my body was so simple .
And everybody is very , very conscious .
I have no relationship with speed , and I think there &apos;s a housekeeping problem , so I think it &apos;s only the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my bedroom ready to go underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , &quot; Hey , I need to play you now . &quot;
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing , so I &apos;m just pushing the wall and I &apos;m going to turn it on .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t recalibrate my body &apos;s suffering anymore .
I couldn &apos;t understand where I started and where I ended up , because my hand was held by Adam and Michael &apos;s wall with Adam and Michael .
If I understood anything , it was energy ...
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the conversation on the left of my brain got so quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s ever heard a T.V. sound with a record controller .
One bite .
First , I was fascinated by the noise in my brain .
But then immediately , the energy boundaries appeared on this huge waste street around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt the most courageous and powerful emotion of myself .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel went to the left of my brain and he told me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a problem . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I told myself I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I came back quickly with a sense of what I &apos;m calling a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think of how beautiful it is that you &apos;re completely immersed in this tiny brain that is keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this hurry where my work and I &apos;m getting pushed about this .
I felt so sorry in my body .
And look at all the relationships that you have from the outside world and from that point of view had been lost .
And I felt a peace and anger .
And look at what it would look like if you flew back from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you had stood up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a hypothesis .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left of my brain and he said , &quot; Hey ! Don &apos;t slow down . &quot;
We need help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should help me be proud of this , so I went home from Honey and I bumped into the machine , and now I &apos;m walking into my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And in that moment , my hand has become completely disconnected .
It was then that I realized that my God was going to attack me , the next thing that my mind is telling me is how wonderful this is !
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
There will be some brain researchers who will come forward to realizing that they can consciously contract their own brain , and that &apos;s inside . ( Laughter ) Then one of my brain came to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very well-known woman . ( Laughter ) I haven &apos;t got time to go . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fighting , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . OK .
I have to call for help . I have to call my job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the job title , and then I remembered that I had my own business card on the phone number .
Then I go into my studio room and I cover three inches of tin shack .
And I look at the top card , even though I can see with my naked eyes clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , not because I don &apos;t see any frame of reference .
And the words on paper are going to be helpful by the marks and the marks , and I &apos;m not learning anything .
So I started waiting for what I call the exhibition .
And at that point , the typical truth was repeated , and I learned that it &apos;s not a card ; it &apos;s not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download this one inch .
And in that period of 45 minutes the effects of the gyrus were increasing to the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I have no option .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took the banks and I put them here , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the phone as they look at the cards .
But then I turn to my own halfway back when I didn &apos;t remember I had that number , that I didn &apos;t have that number .
So I took my fucking arm like a dagger and put it on the sidewalks , and the second hand was clicking on these bullets that when I came back to the normal truth , I could tell you that I had walked past Hindus and finally got all the way to Hindus and I heard that the phone was clicking on my head , a guy called me up and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot;
Then I say to him , &quot; I &apos;m speaking like I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Wooo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I had no idea that I could speak a language and understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And shortly afterward , one ambulance was rushing to the hospital by one of the other mosques at Boston .
I walked up and looked like the child of a fox .
Just like the one clouds where the rest of the world takes place and goes out of poverty , I &apos;ve taken the energy out and I &apos;ve realized to give my spirit out .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer living my life .
Or perhaps my doctor has saved me and offered me a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I left , it was amazing to find out that I still live .
When I felt helpless to my spirit , then I told my life to save God .
Now my brain was stroked apart between two facts .
It was at that time that my emotional system started to form motions that felt just like pain .
The light was shining my brain like the fire in the forest , and the air was so dense and so bright that I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , or I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , and I was just scribbling through the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t really understand the anatomy of my body , so I felt enormous and wide , like someone who had been released from my bowl .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant elephant seal fell into the sea of dirt .
Great Firewall .
I found the quality that matters .
And I was reminded of that , and I was thinking that it was never possible that I would discover my wonderful existence by embracing the microscope of my own body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I am also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought to sleep .
And if I &apos;m married to the neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , then whatever life is that can access the neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world full of beautiful , primitive , empathetic and loving people who know that they can someday feel that quality .
And they can move forward and choose , and the truth is that when they want to move past the left side of their brain , they want to take their steps in search of this comprehensive quality .
And then I understood how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of versions that taught me how to live my life .
And he threw me to be healthy .
After a period of intense destruction in the gymnosophist , the dead blood flow from my brain caused a tumor equivalent to the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
It took me eight years to finish my health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life , the power of life , with the skill and two extremely healthy brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world where we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where , &quot; &quot; I can step right into my consciousness , &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe . I am the power of life .
Fifty-five beautiful cells are made of cellular matrix , one in which everybody is .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a tribe .
Al Gore , from the commercial breakfast .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
Inside , we are .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain controlling electrical activity , the more we will put peace in this world and the more our planet will be stable .
And I thought that was important to solve this idea .
Thank you .

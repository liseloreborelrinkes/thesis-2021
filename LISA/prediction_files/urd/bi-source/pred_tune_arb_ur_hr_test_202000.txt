Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They picked up my name for Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , before a young age , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was waiting to eat .
So I asked myself , did you have the Arab Spring ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he must have been wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Right ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for example . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I love it . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minneo . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; And he said .
He was talking to me about three people , as he was telling himself , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see it . &quot;
What does the word &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can they talk like this ?
That &apos;s when I began to think .
I got angry about that .
Sure enough .
What is it that makes me feel good about speaking my language in my country ?
Where can that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I have many people like me who are walking up to a period of time in their lives , where unfortunately they keep everything that &apos;s in their mind , just because they love the words and are loved .
Should I be bringing all my culture , ideas , opinions and opinions ?
We may have the most important battle preserved in the stories of children .
Do they have to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like ?
How does that make sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice as much as he did for me .
The Arabic language does not question the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research , or the language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use in the workplace , the language that we observe when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use when we study a curriculum .
If we do that , they will cover us .
So where can I communicate this ? We can all ask these questions !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But another more important fact that we need to think about .
It &apos;s the Arabic mother tongue .
Research says that in other languages , you have to translate the skills of your mother tongue to get .
In other languages , the inventive manifestation of language is the basic aspect of language .
How ?
Graveen cells , when she started writing before , were used in Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imagination and philosophy were influenced by the little boy in the house where he grew up , felt a particular joy , felt a particular voice , and thought about it .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn the English textbooks , you feel the same happiness , you feel the same sense .
You can imagine that even in English they are teachers , this little girl who lives in the village next to Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill a nation , it &apos;s by killing its language .
It &apos;s a fact that has emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China are all under control .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in their wallets , they invest a lot in their adventures .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this growing search engine is not yet up to us , and we want to move to this developing world .
They were countries like us at a time , but they decided to try to grow up , study , and move to countries like Turkey , business and so forth , and speak their language as if they were teaching students — like Hurricane .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you &apos;re a product or a product or a product , and it &apos;s not in the store , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be included in these reefs , not casually authorized , as we are more time .
So in order to create new innovations and new solutions , they needed to store their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Conduction , autonomy , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will remind you ?
What would you understand ?
Regardless of who , how and how .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a symbol of the distinct stages in our lives , and the words that are driven by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Conduction , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special pattern in your brain , a special feeling for a particular day in a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal notion that we think about , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our minds ?
How would you understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereign , independent , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes up to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t look at a problem , then I better leave and don &apos;t waste my time talking .
It &apos;s that influences remind us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker who spoke from a French .
I was asking for this occasion .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to update his wife and translate it one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; upside-down . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) He called it &quot; &quot; upside-down , &quot; &quot; and he spent many nights trying to understand it .
He wondered , how could someone really be so obvious ?
Does she want to make herself ?
Bury me . ( English ) ( Typing noise ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand what his wife meant , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; his perception was different .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listened to me , and one night , I tried to translate it to him to feel what I felt when I heard the result . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate it , &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and why you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I put my hands up and you put your hand up . &quot;
It translates . It shows me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to convey the Arabic language ?
We changed it to a way of thinking about society , and we started a curriculum in Arabic .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Get the cold , slow down , slow down . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Library of the Library of Arabic has put forward a line , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because , like , we don &apos;t understand it .
And if anyone tells me , I am fascinated by the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be active in the way that our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives take place .
It &apos;s the way the letter looks and thinks of us .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re answering from the West . &quot; &quot; He says the right punchline .
Very easy , but good and effective .
After that , we started another march with the landscape of the letters on the Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside , a context in which the letters of the black and the blue line are sitting in the back of the text , with the label , &quot; Language kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We &apos;re going to have to look for ourselves .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great opportunity to be new and loving .
After that , we started to read Arabic boys and girls &apos; photos .
Cole images of girls and girls .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve invented the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to make a double check , but I have to say that word that &apos;s good and that &apos;s true .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money , we shouldn &apos;t be saving ourselves .
But to get to that point , we need to convince everybody that we &apos;re not going to let anybody grow up , or that we realize that our language has an authority on top of us , putting pressure on us , or challenging our patient and thinking .
Our idea needs to be invented .
So if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the skeleton or anything , we can still be creative .
At this point , every one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in your mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the global level .
He can repeat the Arabic language once again .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know that , and we have to think that the solution is there , part of the solution , is our guess .
Luckily , what can you do today ?
Who here is Twitter ?
To be compassionate , I urge you , although my time is over , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic script , doesn &apos;t write English !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spectacular ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a lexicon .
Getting back and forth is not easy .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for conservation in this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child speaks to her father for the first time in a language .
When my daughter is born , I don &apos;t believe him , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; ( That &apos;s your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve gone from my daughter &apos;s light to the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that .
And don &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this cultural press . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to say , &quot; &quot; This reminds us of the deepest regret that our presence is not a miracle , except for those negative messages that haunt my people when you see me without observing my generation , I &apos;m tired of this generation of inequality , and I &apos;m tired of speaking up our generation , not until they &apos;re celebrating our generation , we &apos;re
( Applause )
My favorite quote is the ticket dot .
In college , my primary attorney was a vegetable , which meant I was writing lots of notes .
Now a normal person when they write something , something happens .
You know ... ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll start your work smaller , but the first week you do a lot of work and more work later , everything &apos;s done , and it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
My method will work .
My response will be all ready , but actually the textbook will get ready , and then I &apos;ll do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every textbook .
And then came up with a whole new paper , a paper which you do for a year .
And I knew that my normal behavior wasn &apos;t determined at all .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , I decided that I would do something like this .
It &apos;s going to be something like this this this this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , middle classes , pace work up , and eventually I &apos;m going to zoom in on it more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
Go and get drunk , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a big project .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) But then the treatment dropped , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were there .
And two weeks went by , two weeks went by .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in the TED Line , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I wrote 90 pages , I did two streets , I didn &apos;t have to go in two streets , I sat back in the back of the room , I spent a full time in the back of the room , and I went out to David Lane .
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you become Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the grandmother . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , from today &apos;s point of view , that &apos;s the best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe it . ( Laughter )
He was very angry . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about it .
My Ranger regularly gives me six people a drink , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the human brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain makes a difference between six people and six people .
To find out , I made a leaf blood vessel where I could test both brains and stroke brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look away and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not very graphic , but consider it .
So this is a six person &apos;s brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of these brains have decisions in their brains , but the stereotypical brain is entertaining .
Now what does this mean in terms of a string ?
That means everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; Going to work is the best time &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart people will make a decision to make some sense , but they don &apos;t like the project , so they take the book , and they say , &quot; &quot; Look , take the page of the Christmas card , &quot; &quot; Tennessee and touch Harvard , because I know it &apos;s happened .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to go to the puzzle , and you &apos;ll see in 10 minutes something more than that ?
After this , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which is beginning to talk about the TED Foundation , and much later , it &apos;s going to end up watching Tony Baby &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while on these things , so there &apos;s no time to do something about it today .
What &apos;s going to happen ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now it &apos;s not about compassion that you want to say .
It just wants to live in an existing moment .
It doesn &apos;t have any sense of the future ; it &apos;s just two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you know and you spend your entire life going forward and forever , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to build , there is a generation of human animals .
Good to eat , think about it , and increase generation , consumer distance might go like that .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not too far off .
We &apos;re an increasingly educated learner , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a smart person , decides , that we can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting away .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is figure out what to do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes it seems as if they do what is easily and emotionally friendly , like eating , thinking or feeling emotionally in moments of opportunity .
So there &apos;s a catch .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more true that they do what &apos;s hard for a big purpose .
And this is a clue .
And for the sixth-graders , this agreement always leads to an end , which spends more time in the small classroom , a simple and mysterious way that thinks it &apos;s out of the room .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) A dark place is a place where strangers are nicely located .
That &apos;s where the supply chain doesn &apos;t have to be a director .
In the dark fields that make you angry , it &apos;s not really because it &apos;s not a right , it &apos;s a quiet feeling of shame , fear , anxiety , and it &apos;s all about the feelings of hatred , it &apos;s all about the qualities that are in the right order .
The question is , in this case , when the invention is broken , how do you get people to step into the abyss that are less happy but more important ?
It turns out that the Sistine people too are protected , which is keeping it safe all the time in their exact moments — somebody said home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is mostly known , but when David Len is close , it &apos;s a great wake-up call or it &apos;s at a time when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that it only works from that .
Now I had a relationship with it in my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was to be at TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and my anger , something in the brain that decides logically is wrong .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Have you understood anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian map at the lower 2,000 feet and see the Indian map go all the way down to India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , after a month , people at TED decided to name the protesters .
I flipped the web and I took a picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) Household appliances , and in a few seconds the system admits that it was on fire . ( Laughter )
And he remembers that he &apos;s afraid of the house , he &apos;s walking down the tree .
And finally , and finally , smart decision-makers sent books and I can start talking .
Now the homework assignment that every category has been trained to receive , as someone like me would have been given two weeks , and the beginning of the session is not written , and then amazingly , the unbelievable privilege of working is to go to the night and write a sentence .
And three clear-cuts call this the system of sixth-graders .
It &apos;s very good , so it &apos;s not a good thing to do .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the impact on it .
In fact , I got thousands of emails from around the world and from people , from different kinds of backgrounds .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and massively transmitted HIV status .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody was telling the story and saying , &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this issue . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and the number of EMs .
There was a mystery in the script of these people that wrote how much Aswan did in their lives , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what happens next ?
Why are they all in black ?
It turns out there are two sets on the side .
Today , for example , which talked about subjects , they were all David Len .
And when David lines up , recently , the effects of this are crucial because household is reaching .
But the Soviet Union is a different kind of thing , and it &apos;s not about any David Lane .
So if you want a project that you start yourself as an arts or a company — something like an arts or a company , until you start driving yourself to accelerate , to do the job .
In addition to doing so , there are many things that David Lynn doesn &apos;t have to do with his family , including exercise , remembering his health , remembering their relationships , telling them the relationship that they &apos;re not fighting for .
Now if the only way to do the job is to get the job done , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data is in the context of the household department .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with us .
And it remains a kind of traditional desire to look at much less and less about less than just virtuous death , a kind of profound core .
You &apos;re running out of luxury and bad news .
And this can become the currency of the Taliban .
So I thought , this is why they email , and this is why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Twin Towers have seen them , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I looked at all the emails , and one thing was clear : I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a very complicated condition . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of the DVDs in the Upper are good at linking , but remembering keys when the Dead Line exists .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
They &apos;re not too many blocks , especially when some of them are intertwined .
I think we all need to get to this curator .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the business , because every life is failing at any time .
We need to act compassionately .
It &apos;s for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have the same homes there , so maybe we should start doing this right now .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days of U.S. and Afghanistan , a handful of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan were stepping out of an area in Afghanistan , stepping out of a region in Afghanistan , helping to provide an office for the Afghan government to help protect a security office in Afghanistan to help protect a security office in Afghanistan to help the Afghan security forces the Afghan security forces
He came in at the end of a season , and he lived around three , and with a lot of things , he watched Captain Sevin as a kid growing up , he watched Captain Seventine as a kid grow up to save chickens and die .
One of the people who knew her children was a surgeon , and one of the other men with a Spanish Medical Association , was raising a healthy cafeteria , and he was raising a Jewish teacher from Spanish .
And what it showed is that the cave dwellings and skulls of skin are attributed to greenhouse gases .
They put it into helicopter , and then you see what CPU is covering and borrowing from it before it paid for others to save .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is it ? It &apos;s an incredibly exciting emotion when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why I was doing it with people that they weren &apos;t .
You know , at the moment , you &apos;re given these people who want to sacrifice themselves so they can benefit others .
In business , we empower people who want to sacrifice others so that we can benefit .
We &apos;ve got an email account !
So I asked myself , where do people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they go to the forest .
The better people look at the imagery of services , the better people look at the imagery of services .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you &apos;re in a tight environment , each and every one of us has the capacity to work together , then each and every one of us has the capacity to work together , and increase that capacity to do that for others .
I have the greatest privilege of bringing people to bear like this , and we will be told yesterday that I have the greatest privilege of bringing people to bear like this , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing : &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The hard thing about the notion of trust and cooperation is that these are emotions , not humans .
You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Stop me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I put two people together and they do it .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to the front page , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , we see the beginning of the world that is facing the threat of the world , all of these religions are facing us very hard .
There &apos;s nothing intrinsic about it .
Whether it &apos;s impoverished or it &apos;s reduced from resources , it &apos;s a rapid , rapid Twitter , it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan , it &apos;s all working to reduce our lifespan .
And so we &apos;re ready in the form of social animals where we gather and work together as part of what I call a charity , as in a neighborhood where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we felt reassuring and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can go to sleep at night and I can swim to see some of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you don &apos;t look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by the dangers that are trying to make our lives difficult , or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our opportunities of success .
It can make a society more robust , unbelievable in the stock market .
It can be a new technology that lets your commercial break down at night , and it can be a new technology that lets your commercial break down at night .
Or you can have the opposite that sometimes you &apos;re trying to fight .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but it &apos;s at least driving your rise and trying to get your businesses to drink you up , and it &apos;s trying to get your rise and your businesses to drink you up .
We don &apos;t have any authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it will never end .
The only causes of change are conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where the action is , because that &apos;s where the leadership is .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and offer the lives of the people in her organization to protect the people and the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to assess their own personal and false results so that people are there and that they sacrifice their dignity and their dignity and feel secure and feel their personal relationships , the valuable things are there
I was on a journey every day , and I suggested a fact that when a passenger stripped to the place before he tried to leave it , and I saw the stakeholders on the door just as he passed the law as he was .
The first time I tried scuba diving onto it , the first time I tried scuba diving onto it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are we doing things like electricity ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit around like humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we travel to the West Bank with us is not because they keep improving the LHC .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other and therefore reducing the organization .
What &apos;s a great leader for it , I can show you the most close example of how to be a parent is a good leader for it , and the most close example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it is necessary , we want to give our children opportunities , education , systems and record , when it is necessary , to make them grow and to do more of what we can do for ourselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s exactly what the leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , and when they need it , they want to give their people opportunities , education , systems and record , and when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to give them the opportunity to do things beyond what we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve more opportunities than ever imagined .
Harley Kim , who &apos;s the head of a technology company in New York City called Next Jump , is the head of a technology company called Charlie Kamen , who &apos;s the CEO of a technology company in New York City , says one thing : If your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organizations ? How can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charley has a serious business venture capitalist . Charley has de-prioritized the practical imperative .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get to focus on the effective problems .
But if you &apos;ve got a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , just like we &apos;re going to do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are sitting at the CEO , and that &apos;s because they have so many people who have so much anxiety and distress , some bankers are sitting at the CEO , and that &apos;s because so many people have so much anxiety and distress , some of the bankers who are sitting at the CEO , whose unfortunate strangers are more stressed
It &apos;s not about data .
But they &apos;ve mastered the fundamental principles of morality .
They have grown a dense society .
We know that they have given their well-being to their children , and we know that they have given their well-being to their children , but they have told them that they have given their well-being to their children , and they have told them that they have given their well-being to their children , and that they have given their well-being to their children .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re proposing , not data .
Does any reason equate to paying the dough at 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t you give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Not at all .
Great Leaders will never bring the data to the children .
Great Leaders will never bring the data to the children .
They &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save .
At Budapest Chamien Media , they run a mining company in Baby Chip Media , they run a mining training company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they got the big master &apos;s department and they got 30 percent of their driver &apos;s license at night .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to maintain their own benefits even more .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , and so many of the companies you have now put together , and they did a terrible job .
And Bob replied it .
You &apos;ll see that in the lobby , they don &apos;t trust the woodpeckers .
It &apos;s also believing in diarrhea , and reducing disease is more difficult , and it &apos;s more difficult to reduce disease .
And then they built a dedicated program .
That every job , every school , every CEO , would have to put everyone in a small four-week vacation .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Boeing declared the program , it was very important .
He said that it &apos;s better for all of us to pick up the tiny chunks , for some of us to pick up the tiniest chunks of humans and become more compassionate .
So they have given 20 million dollars to children , and most importantly , as they expect , when people feel protected from the dignity of an organization , trust and cooperation is intimate .
And in a way that no one expected , people started businesses from each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful people .
So some people took five volumes to make each other just three volumes .
Machine is an extreme , not a forger .
I know a lot of people who benefit from the most successful organizations , I know a lot of people who benefit from the most expensive markets that the leaders are not .
They &apos;re amateurs , and we do what they say , because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of organizations who have no authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege to see the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had great compassion to look at the person on the left , and they &apos;ve had great compassion to look at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve had great compassion to look at the person on the right .
It happens to be a leader .
I &apos;ve heard a story about some of the science that &apos;s going on out there in the town , and just as the technique of science is that the man is eating honor and he &apos;s exercising his people first , and when he &apos;s playing , he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
And when he came back into the field , his men gave him some food from his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them the leaders who initiate .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered by someone else , we call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered by somebody else .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe , we call them leaders , because they choose to be victims , and that &apos;s how people can be safe , and when we do that , it &apos;s a natural responsibility that makes us human beings suffer .
They &apos;re going to give us their blood and their penis and go to see how their dream becomes reality , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your pancreas and you bring yourself to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do it for us too . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all like to do ?
And aren &apos;t those organizations that we all love to do ? And aren &apos;t those organizations that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the story of a small one called the Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mpumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is incredibly unbelievable , as a condition , and growing in these conditions is so difficult , at 17 years old , I was sitting still in the bush with friends in the bush .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was staring at the breakfast table , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent something that just shook your skin and doesn &apos;t make you sad ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I necessarily buy it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred and fifty of them are in Africa , and many are only in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is the most dangerous tragedy .
One of the things that happens in the eyes of the trauma is that because of the overwhelming effects of the trauma , you can get yourself independently .
This disease kills hundreds of millions of people every year on a continuous basis , and the biggest thing that &apos;s happening is that for the children of the trachoma , you only have to give up on your own : no grandparents , no vegetables , no English .
After watching these thoughtful figures , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I went on to my top night of 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a broadband , I didn &apos;t have a bro@@
And I looked at this as a very special problem .
So what I said was right , our formula was ready .
Now we need to take this thing into account .
Four years later , and the mobile phone , 40 pages full of businesses placed on my phone , and after writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; now and no grief ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mysterious pollution .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need butter .
( Laughter ) So after trying to make it effective in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Machine University entertainment brought some new people , further it , and now we have a full-blown model , which is ready for markets , but now is ready .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at large .
They &apos;re just buying under the need . One guy doesn &apos;t buy a ticket to Alex . He &apos;s buying a ticket because that &apos;s how it works .
So we put DryBath in these creative slices .
You put it between them and you put it outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple one is exchanging only in five ranges .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot about the conservation of industries .
We even want DryBath to get there in the air puffs — ( Laughter ) once in less than a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever it rained and we could save two houses for children , which are in the middle of the inner areas , two houses , more than two hours for school dropouts , two more houses for children .
After seeing the global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out of our key values , our security and our service .
DryBath is a rich man &apos;s service and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re now entering the process of doing this , and we &apos;re actually injecting it into a retail channel that allows it to be retail market , and one question I want to ask you today is , at the Limpopo Circle , in one week , we &apos;re devising 50 degrees with an ion that doesn &apos;t have to be returned to the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I learned a lot from this early work , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I am still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African to call this academic , and one thing that amazes me is why all the teachers did not regret it . Thank you .

I &apos;m here today to share some of the results with you , and I &apos;m also surprised by what are the actual reasons why organizations are successful — which is why they &apos;re initially successful .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you choose a group of people with the desire to equality waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find the human capabilities which were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why do most of the time fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know a lot of organizations about this , reflecting a lot of my misconceptions and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations in the last year .
I wanted to know this because I was starting at 12 years old at the foundation of a variety of different businesses at the Yale High School , while I was starting high school when I was making solar tools , then I was in college , when I was making radio .
When I left school , I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the Indus script started , in the last 20 years we &apos;ve done a number of hundred companies , and very few accidents .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to look at these factors for the greatest cause of success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think everything is .
That &apos;s why I named my company &quot; &quot; The Idiot Laborture &quot; &quot; is the last time you feel about it .
With closing , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to be skilled or injured , are more important factors .
I never thought it would be appropriate to speak at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan , until I need one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business as well .
The ability to train a team is important for the ability to learn from the side of the car .
Each one is an objective reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about delivery ?
With it , it seemed to me that growing up was the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes organizations make a huge investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
Of course , after that — is it the right time ?
Did it come quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s soon , so you will come and teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or so far from now , and I &apos;m already in a hurry ?
So I took these five factors with great respect for many organizations .
And they &apos;ve launched 100 companies in the Library of India , and 100 of them outside the organizations are able to attempt a scientific conclusion .
So first of these videos , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of revenue .
And on the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we were very hopeful , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to pinpoint all of these letters as I think these companies had moved on .
Then in the outskirts outside Liber , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in the new companies , and sometimes it was a business model , but it couldn &apos;t work .
I tried to learn that the most important factors affected all companies &apos;s success and failure , and the result struck me .
The first thing was choice of time .
42 percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the League perspective is on the second level , and then the idea , being different , being individual , is actually number three .
But it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not true that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was amazed that the idea doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the business model and investment comes in my mind .
I think the market model is still low , because you can start a business model without a market model , and then you can add the product to the city .
And investment , if initially low investment , but now it &apos;s increasing , so especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples here of all of these nodes .
A big success on Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of investors looked at this company because people thought , &quot; Who is it going to take to get some of their homes to work ? &quot;
Of course , this proved wrong .
One of the reasons why gross is successful is because of the best market model , the thinker , and the market perspective is the right time .
This company came in front of a problem when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people respond to the proposition of putting a market in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
However , time was absolutely right to make the innovators they needed .
Dreaders were also aspiring for additional support ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a website .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to look at more companies .
We thought it was best , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . With a lot of supplies and a great marketing model , let &apos;s work with some of the great leaders in Hollywood .
In 1999- to 2000 , the broadband Internet was very low .
It was very difficult to watch online videos , you didn &apos;t have to know what to code in your browser , and finally this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of the code and lowered 50 percent in the U.S. Broadband , YouTube got the best time .
Great , good time .
The truth is , when YouTube started , there was no commercial model of it .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was a particularly optimistic time .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
The idea is very important .
But maybe time is very important .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really hungry for your success .
And certainly the truth is , what the outcome is not from them , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but in terms of time frame , you have to work with a lot of confidence .
As I said before , organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of them are helpful at increasing your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , you &apos;re the best listeners .

&#91; 3 a.m. in 2016 we saw the greatest data point in history . &#93; &#91; Fifty accounts addressed expensive and powerful people &#93; &#91; Extreme money laundered in non-state companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We launched the Global Ventures Trust Trust Trust Trust to illustrate . &#93; This week , the revolution was central to the success of the story that
Fifty of which painted these papers into the tiniest slum of blue shell companies .
We have the inner stories of the villages , the banks and the villages , who come in with the fundraising forms like the Masa da Musica , and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a home company , can you teach us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at the emails , you can look at the text message exchange , you can look at the way it works , how it works .
It &apos;s starting to show up .
The CEO of the U.S.
We also have the news that the weekly dating companies are weekly journalists .
Two billion dollars in the revenue from Russia down to my primary source of electricity from his childhood companion , which is a famous series .
And many well-meaning people will be infected , and whatever they say , they will be at home with more blunt documentaries .
Now , this tells a story of a magic film , or a story of Jesus Christ , which I have with me .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that grammar and power are in the spaces of our pockets and how much we don &apos;t need to tax , meaning that fine actions such as healthcare and education have less money .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , the Global Witness , it &apos;s amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people put their influence on the military companies that are discussing with our ideas .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful , respectful world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s sort of like a road map .
You can run a second company inside a company , a second company inside , and it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind this thing .
It &apos;s hard to understand why institutions rationalized , journalistic , school-based institutions are so difficult to figure out what &apos;s going on .
I think it &apos;s also interesting in the U.S.
Maybe that &apos;s why famous Americans don &apos;t have to be on that scale .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
That &apos;s why the U.S. Foundation campaign works , there are a few of them .
I think if we study the findings of Kim Illind or Dil View or Mountain or Home , it &apos;s the same as the relationship between America .
But a lot of American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , they need less information to run the company than they do in the library .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
Non-military investment is comfortable .
The circumstance of this type is affecting all of us .
Now in the Gulf Ventures , we wanted to look at what her problem was .
How does it actually work ?
So we did this , and we transferred a budget to the 13 intelligence companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to move to America , a home , a ship and a space to buy .
The heart valve is that all of the machines have been able to visualize a single imagination of how schools can move soup .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make any money for ourselves , and we didn &apos;t give anyone a money , but it was a bad idea for the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not done individually .
It &apos;s not about individual well-being , which has kind of been talked about and suggested by our instructions .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s the system &apos;s way of doing it , which is to protect the tech , the television , the poverty and the insurance .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder to produce .
It can be intellectual , as we can &apos;t do something about it , we can never change it , so people who are wise and strong will always be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the company talks about the capability .
This issue was solved on a political issue , but the British Secretary of Defense Department of Defense committed in eight seconds that happened in southern London in 2013 .
And since then , European Union is forming a central climate crisis , which is basically who owns the companies or is controlling them .
The evidence is that the ECM is behind it .
The distribution in terms of the distribution of laws in the center and in the center , where the growth we wanted was not high , so we were five .
We want to look at the research , the large intelligence agencies , which have been used to start in the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Gulf Ventina .
We need to reach out to the people who need to know their knowledge behind barber companies .
Suppose they speak up , it &apos;s not good for adoption , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to address this issue , change the law enforcement of information .
We can violate this separation by the secrets that are due to the cutting and the cutting of the classroom .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lexx , which is your invention , has made much more sense in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can that be true ?
Julian Song : Yes , does it work ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a background — isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing the effectiveness of a small group of businesses is successful in delivering this kind of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does this happen ?
How do people make tools ?
And how do you allocate them ?
Julian Sanguay : There we are . I can talk to you about it . It &apos;s in the right way , public service , and we have a lot of ways to get information to us .
That &apos;s why we use a lot of high-rise games to remove materials from one place to the Internet , to remove the signs from legal contracts like Sweden and Bill &apos;s .
We get the information from data , from ordinary data , from Ross Square , or whatever , commissioning news organizations like normal news organizations , frame — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about giving massive information to people and then protecting yourself against the illegal and political opinions .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is the key , but you actually never know what the scale is .
Julian Sanguay : That &apos;s right , that &apos;s where we sometimes get to know , and if we get to the point where we get to the point , we quickly upload the information .
( Rattling ) God forbid it .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s sort of coming up and asking what the code is , the TED Talk . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s take an example .
This is something you thought about a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , it &apos;s a Carl Report .
It was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had turned 18 .
She was an emergency room in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the book — due to the authoritarian authorities that were trying to fight from Kenya , they spent 20 million pounds on this report card and one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to fight its political will , which was the best person — still the most prosperous person in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this , before the great election in December 2008 .
When we reported that report , three days later , we decided to make a friend of mine , Kabul , the person who was horrified , the Daniel Ap , so this report was hung in the back of the capital .
CA : And — so I mean , let me just say very briefly — this was played out in Kenya , not by commercial reasoning , but by the mean , it changed the result of your choice .
Julian Sanguay : Yes . This is the headlines in Guardian , and then it happened in all the major countries in Kenya , in the talks of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , a few days later , gave the Nigerian Prime Minister the confidence that they could talk about it .
And this car sits on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equation 10 percent , according to a Chinese sex report , and it changed the result .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your secret interpretation really changed the world ?
Julian Song : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re just showing you a little bit of a video of a giant joke .
It &apos;s like a video . But here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart failure .
RG : It &apos;s tough . It &apos;s tough when you first brush them in .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
The path is clear . Now it &apos;s fine . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your show , tell me . Gold .
Everybody pays .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Machine noises ) Galen is running .
Hatzalah . Hatzalah . Two hundred , two brown meters .
We should move now , time is up !
Okay , now we killed eight people by hand .
Here we &apos;re looking at two Hilly Catters , and we &apos;re still running out of gas .
Roger . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what a contract . What was happening ?
God forbid you , evil . He &apos;s fine . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julian Sanging : The people who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We ended up bringing two people together and doing more research .
It was the first in three dimensions that happened in that case .
CA : So 11 people stood up in this case , two people on a regular run ?
Julie Snow : Yes ! Two employees in the Royal Rights , two small children were kidnapped .
Twenty-six people broke together .
CA : And after his execution , he suffered a great deal .
What was the fundamental cause of the regret , you think ?
Julian Song : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as a very , very unequal force .
On the one hand , some people are going to the village , and then a kilometer away , the village idiot begins to scratch 30 kilometers of coastal plants for every one of them — from any other party — and also gives birth to children .
They also had two journalists who weren &apos;t in any way competitive , because they were conscious .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Brodel Mining got arrested , and it said that he had acknowledged in Chatty Rome that he had acknowledged this video to you over 280,000 and a half American records as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanguay : So what we did was we accepted the doctrines .
Five days ago , it was tried to get 150,000 pieces and 50 pieces .
But we &apos;ve now done what we do at the beginning of the year with Rwanda and the American safety house , but there &apos;s no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of calls for the American safety family ...
Julian Singer : We &apos;re giving them what we &apos;re doing . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do ? ) Julian Song : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Song : Because these things show that actually , what the Arab government is doing , for example , is violating human rights in these governments .
If you look at the fine details of this type of material , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Let &apos;s play around with it .
I mean , normally what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you store hidden information ?
Julian Snow : So the question is , how important information is in the world , how much information can be done .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that organizations spend a lot of money on , and it &apos;s a good indication that when they should get the information out , they hope to do something good , because the organizations know it better , and they know their stories , they care about it too .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But are there any risks involved individually or collectively , where innovation doesn &apos;t exist unexpectedly ?
Julian Sanging : We didn &apos;t do what the records were with them .
I mean , our biggest challenge is action .
With this information , we &apos;re devising in a very particular way the information that &apos;s being private — the information that &apos;s available to someone who &apos;s presenting .
But there are also some mysteries — for example , your doctor has your information ; it &apos;s a miracle — but we &apos;re talking about these civic services that come in and out of the way .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing it with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to do about it , for example , you think , is a father , whose daughter is in the United States Senate , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve influenced something like this that &apos;s a willingness to unite other people .
It shows an American scientific heritage on dead people .
Which is the influence — but it has also given millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is .
Although they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Snow : There are many questions like this .
But remember in the cave , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people don &apos;t have to watch a video , so they look at it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions , it doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions .
Because they look at all of these things .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and their thoughts that give them money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : All right , so you seem to think of hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous if you wanted to light it up , you needed to be able to be able to be virtuous with your own mind ?
Julian Song : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different cell .
We don &apos;t have the kind of information that is abused by other minds .
If they do that , it &apos;s a very difficult situation for us to do that , but we &apos;re doing the same thing that people are ethically committed to feeling that they &apos;re going to increase their jobs later .
CA : I think , as far as we &apos;ve heard anything about it — come from the innocent .
You might also assume that there will be different kinds of roles about leadership and religion .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or the problem .
What does the hero &apos;s point of view look like ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanguay : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : These are great people , great .
We &apos;re going to try and do it . The forces are going to show you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
So this is a very interesting story , which is old , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Snow : This is a model of what we do almost every day .
So at the end of the year — in November , there was a massive leak in the banks , as was happening in the Gulf of Mexico , but not very big .
And we had a report card — which was a very nice experiment about it — that was told that in fact , conservation agencies had been running around and they were running there .
And it was something that the federal government had done , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing on that report , so for us it was a very difficult task .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate her because she didn &apos;t know who she wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , maybe it &apos;s a company that &apos;s all playing opposite .
That &apos;s what we did on the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and I look it up correctly , but we can &apos;t anticipate it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter from the same week that she wrote that , she wanted to look at the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to look at the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how much money you &apos;re legal for ?
Is that really yours ? Then they brought us that look at Scratch , with the name of manufacturing , Microsoft Earth .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s what happened a lot .
It &apos;s our way of reimagining and predicting what matter is , and trying to write and get the letters from these people .
CA : All right . So , any information from inside Bible ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , we &apos;ve got a lot of stuff , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re putting together a bunch of really cool stuff , like hard stuff .
So our response to this has been going on for several months , because we are improving our buck system because of this rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s friction .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing field , more of our capabilities are piloted on us for our greater growth , and that means that we have a lot of civil services in the population , but we don &apos;t have enough people to process this information and to predict it .
CA : So that &apos;s a problem , essentially , why are there so many recent advocates or journalists ?
Julie Snow : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s very difficult to rethink quickly , because with the material we have with the material , we need to reinvent the organization so that we can bring people together , we need to develop a lot of sensitivity about the materials of legal protection , and then less sense of the deals .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re telling us about your own personal relationship and how you got to the job .
And I think what I &apos;ve learned is that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julian Sanguay : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the city , so the two reasons were affected .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so what this says is that everything can be done can only produce a mental disorder .
Julie Snow : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a kid at a young age , and you came up with this idea of working very quickly .
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a recent surgeon from a very young age .
I wrote an email , and I was the girl at the time when this crash hit me .
That &apos;s why you should respect words with words .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that you can use different things .
Unfortunately , at that time , it was only Russian women who were able to bank your grandmother .
That &apos;s why the word , it &apos;s not as powerful as it was before .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps something about their life that helped them improve themselves ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic value : well , good , hard people don &apos;t generate masters ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the greatest lesson I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and heavy people who live in my life .
CA : Can people not produce healthy and healthy products ?
Julian Song : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to grow mammals , which is closer to police , has crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s in my office for a very long time .
CA : So , we &apos;ve just got this in the last few minutes : What happened in the U.S.
Basically you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you &apos;ve got the newspaper that tells the story a little bit resistant to the story .
Instead , they inspired your situation .
That makes you very famous in the U.S. , and then what happened ?
Julian Song : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
The E.U. directed a crisis .
There it was .
The bank had grown to 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the prohibition of the law enforcement , five minutes before it was published , was like a movie : The prohibition of anti-immigration , and the state of Newsweek was , &quot; That &apos;s never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming all the time , and we &apos;re going to be very famous in the Ice Leader , I went to the Ice Leader and talked about this issue .
And the problem for the people there was that they shouldn &apos;t be again , and as a result , the Asian scientists in the country , working with some of the other international environmentalists , we launched a new category called the Asian Leadership Act , which is a kind of freedom media , the most protective space for journalists all over the world , the new Nepal prince , for free .
A native state of island is similar to light , so the system is heading up from the bottom up .
And a month ago , the Alliance Parliament considered it appropriately .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you realize that the more expected it is to show power and power , greater security , or do we observe whether it &apos;s going to empower or it &apos;s going to do the most ?
Julian Sanguay : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure for the law of liberty and the law of transparency around the world — in Europe , in China and in the U.S.
How does it cost ? It &apos;s difficult to say .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to live — because with a small effort , we can move it side to side .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the role of audiences to call it , the judge , the respect , and all the power to you .
Julie Song : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I worked in the kitchen .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is a milestone .
I used to check on my childhood connectome , and I saw it in the gardens .
When I was growing up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I had this epiphany .
My team was stuck .
And when I looked at it from a private point of view , I thought , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the mines where I grew up , surprisingly , North Carolina , Persia , or London , repeatedly shot four species of beings at the foot of the mines , they were nice , dark , silent and coding .
And I thought this was a big curious thing , and I was amazed to see if anyone else had a virtuous mentor .
And when I looked at it , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at the Catholic team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To constrain the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human quality .
We did this work 10,000 years ago when we took care of our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s very rare and disturbing , you &apos;ll see all the creatures like this .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , cow , white and black .
It &apos;s also true of wind .
You look at me on the streets of New York City 150 or 200 years ago in the middle of New York City , you &apos;ll see pictures and postcards and postcards .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of magnesium , the turtle , the turtle , but also the turtle .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Shire .
This is a brand new problem .
And we &apos;ve been doing this for 50 years .
The Second World War gave us a tremendous passion to be afraid .
During the Great War , we developed technologies such as smoking , pollution , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see the greatest increase in the ability to move forward .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that armed farm and sea urchins have increased , and within a couple of years , its income has increased greater than common ground .
Now if you collect forest and forest nutrition , it &apos;s equivalent to two Chinese births every year .
My favorite example of using Chinese cochlear is not an accident , because China is not only the largest country , but it &apos;s also the largest country .
Now go to your square legs .
The first use of salt in the U.S. and the West is the same .
Forestry is an incredibly bad source .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , or 15 pounds of forest to get to market .
Even the Indus script is incredibly precise .
In a study done in Delhi University , it showed that gasoline sequesters are extremely ineffective in terms of carbon emissions .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That whose battlefields have dropped out , those are the mangroves .
Now look at these cute girls .
This planet puts its footprint on its area , protects the beaches , livestock and petri dishes , all sorts of important things for the environment .
Over many years , this has happened with the management camps .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years feeding hundreds of millions of coal plants .
Another process that &apos;s here , which is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; Even on the Tropical River , you &apos;ve seen this very controversial thing .
Today , there are several species that are affected by spinal cord injuries , but with it , many more ants are affected by spinal cord injuries and turn into food .
And a lot of the time it works from the slums , which are named after the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means that the ecosystem was playing itself and playing around .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You need to look at large areas in order to organize like this .
Our own area , as scientists call it , is called the ICCAT , the Internet Convention for Defense Administration .
The philanthropist has also put together a great adventure to explore all the technology .
We can make the flap of tuna , but it &apos;s not good for tuna fishermen .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s warm blood .
It &apos;s over 40 miles per hour , and the temperature of its body can heat over 20 degrees Celsius .
All the walls in the middle of the night are closed .
A freshly waxed pneumonia is a blood vessel that doesn &apos;t last very long .
This is the best for protein .
But the forest creatures are 40 miles away , and they cannot stay in frame .
Time has been a good deal , it doesn &apos;t have to be a bad deal .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was running a war zone .
If you look at the scale of the connectome , each dot is a gift .
In the policy of connectivity , there are 3,000 of them .
I &apos;m saying that the connectome is greater than the people of the connectome — ( Laughter ) if anyone has the power of the connectome , I think we can improve the world .
And everywhere they go , these are the rockets that propel the desert to give to their children .
As a result , we have a success in leadership and conspiracy .
When the weather started , there were six pounds of forest floor in Sami to create a piano .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s a little bit of false water , because if you look at the footprint on Florida , they name the footprint for a footprint .
Whereas this information is being processed from the inside out .
It &apos;s hard to say something about parallel and parallel .
But then again , the credit industry tells us that it has become a scourge for replacing the Phoenix Islands .
This is a system that &apos;s producing oxygen that &apos;s playing out the earth from Jupiter .
This is seven percent per year .
Even though we &apos;re spending a little bit less money on getting to market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money on that .
We &apos;re not just eating milk ; we &apos;re also eating milk and eggs .
We have what &apos;s left and what &apos;s left and what &apos;s left .
Because on top of it , blood and hands and so forth add bullets .
I &apos;m also surprised to know what she did , but she played puppets .
First of all , India or die — ( Laughter ) This is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of wildlife products for 20 years that have been reclaimed from the oceans .
That &apos;s the equivalent of China &apos;s third quarter , or the equivalent of American men coming out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia actually started as lions .
And it began to look like a local finance owner noticed that the next day they would never be on a McDonald &apos;s .
He went down to the bathroom and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s take a look .
What was more likely to be seen as the Summerwear for the Summerwear , this was a demonstration that Helen did not die .
So he built his lip song .
Unfortunately , the pendulum came in 30 seconds .
He wanted to make it a 25-minute seminar , so he pulled the internet code .
For example , the Polaroque of Philadelphia , which is the largest mass-market industry in the United States , the arts industry , moves from two to three billion pounds a year to two billion pounds per year .
If we eliminate the policies , maybe the current elections are trified .
20 years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plasma proteins in a very efficient way in human protein , and it gives me a breath for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; in nine months it &apos;s growing from an individual .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a dirty vegetable .
It doesn &apos;t even include IBM and AIDS that we think will live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
Which represents a large part of three million tons .
A chance for conservation guards to ask , can we eat it ?
Can we justify it instead of giving it to people ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a happy childhood in the marketplace where the usual suspects of displacement are the most effective of insulin &apos;s money .
This is amongst the top three , EPA and DIY .
So this is her potential .
But instead of giving it a way to ourselves and instead of giving it a few dollars to Pune or Pop , and then changing it to Facebook , we can crowdsource the left-hand corner and actually pay the left-hand corner for the second time ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
Indus calculus is incredibly effective .
Indonesia &apos;s meat is only three parts .
Actually , the average of three doesn &apos;t come from the kitchen .
The ocean creates three vertices in the middle , so they just collect them .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue ancestors , the reason for using Facebook and neuroscience is because of the use of cymatics .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , which is a very big cause of death in the oceans .
As you might think about the cloud , in all these different mechanisms , there are more than three protons , and more than three , these are very effective targets .
It &apos;s exactly the same as true .
And finally , there &apos;s a question mark .
We can create a kind of flexible prosthetic that can provide us with a more valuable proposition .
It needs to be a green fluid , it needs to grow fast and alternating environments like its own capabilities , and it needs to be an EPA , DHA , OMG3 and a Facebook account .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about it , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it .
But try to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is about 30 million in the oceans .
What I mean by that is that everything is happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was there to study the big brain because I have a brother who is affected by mental illness .
Eventually and later , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I could combine my dreams with my reality and make my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they disconnect their dreams from the public and the public and they act .
So I &apos;ve spent my life researching intense mental illness .
And I moved from my own personal project to Boston , where I worked at the President Francis Bank , which was in the psychosis of Harvard University .
What are the answers to the biological level differences in people &apos;s brains that usually assume are analogous to the brains of people who are affected by Schizophrenia or by the IPCC ? So in fact , we were trying to build the microbial microscopic clues of the brain , whose cell sends the message , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the connection with the chemical data ? &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this research in the day , but on a weekly basis , I was on a pilot &apos;s journey to the NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intellectual discourse .
On the left of my brain was a new one .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain become completely disconnected by any ability to understand information .
In the morning of college , learning to read and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever looked at the human brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the part of the brain that touches the back of the brain with the wrist , and this will be in my mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
For those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain works like a solar system .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the cross-section of the cultural column that somehow negotiates with 300 exoskeletons .
But in addition to that , they &apos;re both absolute hogens .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part of the consciousness has a completely different understanding of the information , their minds are on different things , and you let me let you know who they are , very different from each other .
The deal will be — Thank you . It &apos;s been a great deal .
Audience member : Yes , there &apos;s a lot more .
( Laughter ) Our brain is experiencing that moment .
Here , at this point , our brain is thinking in part of our brain , thinking organically about the movements of our body .
Information flows through the body in a wasteful way , and instantaneously throughout our whole nervous system , and then it comes down and it forms a giant alphabet class that tells us what exists for a moment and what &apos;s in mind and what &apos;s in mind .
I &apos;m an energy bound up with the energy around me by the right part of the brain .
We &apos;re using energy from each other , from the right part of the brain , as a human family .
And at that time , we &apos;re bringing together a brilliant team of planets to make the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the best and the most beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is considered scientifically and theoretically .
The left part of our brain is about the past and the future .
The way the left of the brain is to say that our greatest aluminum / cloud of our current is to gather the talks and then start to gather those talks .
And it also informs all of this information organization and embeddedness about all of the things that are going on in the past that we &apos;ve ever learned , and the possibilities of the future , namely , of our projects .
The bottom part of our brain is thinking about language .
It &apos;s a sequence of conversations that touches us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a tiny little voice telling me how to buy you home .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a sense of pursuing my computing book that reminds me that I &apos;ve got a book to read .
But perhaps the most important voice is the one that says , I am ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become isolated .
I become one of the only people around me with incredible energy and excitement from you .
And the part of my brain that happened that morning was filled with the pollution .
The morning in the aftermath of Philadelphia , my left eye , behind my eyes , gained suffering .
It was as painful as the eye of the eye .
And that pain touched me and left me alone .
And then he leaves , and then he leaves .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never suffered from any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I sat down and I put on my cardboard , which is a body sports machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , because it feels like my hand is the fate of an initial human being that touches Donald &apos;s .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , I &apos;m feeling so weird and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my perception changes , the general sense of truth , that I &apos;m a human being who &apos;s playing the machine out of this experience , but now I &apos;ve been a very humbling and mysterious place where
And it was all very strange , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started walking around the room , and I felt like everything in my body was going on .
And everything is very difficult and very thinkable .
I &apos;m not connected to my speed , and I think there &apos;s a household problem , so I just focus on the inner system .
I &apos;m growing up in my bedroom ready to underwater , and I &apos;m actually speaking inside my body .
I heard a sound that was saying , and my background needs to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then my balance goes up , and I write down the wall .
I lie down and I look at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t repair my body &apos;s emotions now .
I couldn &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped , because my hand and my hand were held together by atoms and magnetic walls .
If I understood something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment , the speech on the left of my brain got so quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s ever heard a T.V. radio .
A gift .
First , I was surprised by the loss of my brain .
But then immediately , as I did in another light switch , this huge spacecraft that was all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; You know , you &apos;ve got a problem . &quot;
So we need to help , and I told myself , I &apos;m really in charge of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really in charge of the problem , but I &apos;ve come back in a sense that I &apos;ve been calling for a lot of money .
But it was such a beautiful place .
Think about how wonderful it is that you &apos;re completely involved in this tiny brain that &apos;s keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my wrist and I &apos;m getting stressed out about it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And consider all of your relationships that are from the outside world , and any of them have been missing .
And I felt a sense of peace and anger .
And consider what it would look like if you were staying behind this 70-year-old emotional weight that you were staying with .
( Laughter ) Oh , so I set up a mess .
It was very beautiful .
Then my brain got to the front of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow !
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should be helpful , I should be proud of it , so I went from a poor house to a poor house , and I put a machine gun in my apartment , and now I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And at that point , my mother got very , very upset .
At that time , it occurred to me that my God was going to attack me , the other thing that my mind was telling me is how amazing it is .
( Laughter ) How amazing !
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who &apos;s going to get this opportunity to realize their own brain , and they come from inside ( Laughter ) and then one blood comes to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very popular woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to relax . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t cut the golf cart , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll return to my normal . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call my job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job title , and then I remembered that I had a business card on my phone number .
I go into my studio and I create a three-dimensional motion card .
And I look at the top card , even though I can see from my own brain &apos;s eyes clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card I don &apos;t think because I don &apos;t look at the dots .
And the words were helped from the point of paper and the point of view , and I wasn &apos;t learning anything .
And then I started waiting for him to tell me the story .
And at that point , the general was repeating the truth , and I was learning that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download this slide .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of the pollution on the left were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any way .
So I take a phone and I put it there .
I took a business card and I put it there , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards .
But then I picked my elbow when I came back , and it didn &apos;t remind me that I had made that number .
So I raised my hand like a Danish , and I stood on the Hindus , and I put my hands on the other hand , and I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , when I went back to the normal truth , I found myself in India , and finally I got all the way from India , and I heard that the phone rings on my wrist ,
I then say to her , &quot; I &apos;m speaking clearly in my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And for me , the sound is something like &quot; &quot; Woo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language at the time , and I couldn &apos;t understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And just a little bit later on in an ambulance , Sierra Leone in Boston was visiting the other Cambridge community .
I walked around looking like a toddler who was a toddler .
Just as the weather remained wasted and sank out of the closet , I pulled energy out and I felt a sense of wonder .
And that moment made me realize that I &apos;m not alone in my life right now .
Or , the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or gives me a chance to transition .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I still lived .
When I felt a sense of my spirit , I said , &quot; &quot; I have saved my life .
Now my brain was distorted by two different facts .
It was at that time that the emotional system started to trigger the emotional system that only felt in pain .
Light raised my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were so strong and so strong that I couldn &apos;t even understand a voice from the sight of the landscape , and I was just scribbling the path of furniture .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture in the breath , so I felt so much and so much like a person who had been free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great evangelical meltdown in the middle of nowhere .
Great / Neon .
I found the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I would discover my great intention of hiding the inside of a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought in by neurons .
And if I &apos;m brought in neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is that neurons can be generated , and I &apos;ve seen a world that has been brought in by people who are beautiful , transparent , comfortable and loving , who know that they can sometimes feel that quality .
And they can choose to live together , and the right thing is that they want to take a book apart from the left of their brain to seek this hypothetical quality .
And then I realized how incredible this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What is this stealth of structure that taught me to live my life ?
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After the stroke of the stroke , the stroke stroke stroke strokes caused my brain a stroke like a stroke , which was the stroke of the brain &apos;s slowness .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of spaceship life , of hand skills and two extremely good brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment to decide who we are and what we want to be in the world .
That &apos;s where I can stand at the right part of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , and I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful mammalian cells are found in one form , one in which everything exists .
Or I can choose to walk to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a kind of a stupid way .
From cosmic rays to elephants .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And who ?
I think as long as we spend our left-brained time resting the primary electrical current of the right brain , we &apos;re going to increase world peace and our planet is going to be very prosperous .
And I thought that the idea needed to be resolved .
Thank you .

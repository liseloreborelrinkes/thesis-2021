Good morning !
Are you people staying ?
They picked up my name , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , a while ago , I was sitting in the restaurant with my friend and I was eating free .
So I wondered , do you have a free rig in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Solly ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Hebrew , Hebrew . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; Did the French be right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Boy said .
He was speaking to me from three men , as he had told me , &quot; If this were the last girl in the world , I would not see her ! &quot;
What does the word &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A young Kenyan teenager imaged a girl with two words and placed them specifically .
How does he speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s stopping me from giving my language to my country ?
Where could that be ?
How did we get there ?
Now , when we &apos;re here , there are many people like me , who come to a stage in their lives where they rarely leave out everything that &apos;s going on in their past , just because they are so much happier and depressed .
Should I be leading my whole culture , my ideas , my spirit and my spirit ?
Perhaps we have the most important battle stories of children in children .
Should they recite me all that I had learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
How does that work ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice as spiritual as I had for you .
Arabic doesn &apos;t require much of what it is today .
It &apos;s not science , or research , or language that we &apos;re using in universities , a language that we &apos;re using everywhere in the workspace we look at when we work on a research project , and it &apos;s certainly not a language that we &apos;re using just the Higgs boson .
If we do that , they will follow our document .
So where can I explain this ? We can ask all this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s a second more important fact that we should think about .
Arabic is the mother language .
research tells us that in order to acquire mastery in other languages , we need to acquire our mother tongue .
In other languages , the intrinsic nature of language is the basic unit of invention .
How ?
The juggler cell , when he first started writing , was using Arabic .
All of their ideas , the imagination and the philosopher was inspired by the little boy in the village where he grew up , felt a special sense of hopelessness , sounded a particular voice , and thought about a special idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their books in English , you felt the same sense of gratitude , you felt the same sense .
You can imagine that these are also in English , these are the same texts as the little boy who lived in the forest of the Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to stop its language .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s happened in the developed world .
Germany , France , Japan and China all came together .
That &apos;s why they create laws to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in their payments , they spend a lot of money on their marketing campaigns .
Do we know the best ?
Right , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this notion of the developed world that we &apos;re not yet reaching , and we want to get to the developed world .
They were countries that looked like us in the past , but decided to try to make progress , research , and move to countries , such as Taiwan , employees and so on , they formed their language to follow each other as teachers : to keep it safe , like Hasbro .
They made it their own .
Because if you &apos;re a product of a tortured or a quarter , and you &apos;re not written on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be in these arteries , unbeknownst to us , like we are more time .
So in order to create new inventions and applications , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Dark , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you of ?
What does that tell you ?
Regardless of who , how and where .
Languages are not just for discussion , only words are suffering from us .
Languages contain a very specific set of stages in our lives , and words that are intertwined with our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Self , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a unique set of emotions in your brains .
Language is not the name of putting together one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that &apos;s really based on how we think , and how we look at each other and how we view ourselves .
What &apos;s our minds ?
How would you say you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about slavery .
The thing is , these affections do remind us of a particular thing .
A friend of mine , a French speaker , had some French speaker .
I was asking her for some time .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his wife and translate it into something that meant &quot; &quot; crap . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Women typically called it &quot; &quot; crap , &quot; &quot; and then all night I tried to understand it .
He wondered , how could someone really be so obvious ?
Do they want to self-destruction ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Together ) Here are a couple of examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way of thinking about it was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me FedEx , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I feel when I hear FedEx . &quot; &quot; The black woman was trying to translate that , &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and you hugged it . &quot; ( Laughter ) And SM : And because you &apos;re me , I raised my hand and I left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
Turn it on .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We turned it into a way of thinking about society , and we started an Arabic language Conservation campaign .
As many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Leave the cold , go ahead . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protector made a phrase , which is , &quot; I talk to you East , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t come up with this method because , like , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate in Arabic .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be robust in a way that reflects our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
It &apos;s a letter that looks like us and the way we think .
So this sentence : &quot; &quot; I talk to you in the East , but you respond to the West . &quot; &quot; Sitting the right sign .
Very simple but powerful and effective .
Later , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on the ground .
You see , out there , you see an example , in a context with the letter black and the blue tips , with the text , &quot; Don &apos;t Demand . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really don &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we destroyed our language , we must have known for ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great opportunity to play games of novelty and religion .
Later on , we found boys and girls in Arabic .
Cole models of girls and girls .
We are so many !
And if somebody says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used the English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve taken the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to make as much arguments as two , but I have to say a word that &apos;s great about it and that &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t shave ourselves .
But to get to that point , we need to let everybody know that we are not going to let anyone make a breakthrough or that we are going to have the language above us , to press us , to press us , to confront our patients , to confront our thought .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t rebuild the rocket or something , we can be more creative .
At the moment , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother language .
Let &apos;s start with that .
They write a word or make a short film .
A single neuron can reach us globally .
He can re-draw Arabic at the forefront .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we have to know , and we have to realize that the solution is there , part of the solution , is our guess .
Honestly , what can you do today ?
Who are you Twitter ?
In compassion , I reject you , even though I &apos;ve lost time , or Arabs , Britain , France or Chinese .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Alliance scripts !
( Applause ) This is decrepit ! This is not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to meet the need for language .
Now let me tell you a secret .
For the first time , a child is born with a language of his father .
When my daughter was born , I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , Hi . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I defiled my daughter &apos;s light in the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama , &quot; &quot; won &apos;t say that .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anyone to notice it . ( Applause ) You get caught up with this cultural prescription . ( Applause )
I speak Later English to us that it is deep to remember that our condition is not a secret , that it is only in the negative parties that make me angry , even when you see my generation without vision of banking , we have to remember that gender equality is not good enough for our generation when they &apos;re not known to give our generation , when they &apos;re known to give us feedback , because we do expect that
( Applause )
I love the chocolate dot .
In college , my primary attorney was a Government , which meant I had written more documents .
Now , the average person when they write something , here &apos;s what happens .
You know , you know â€” ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll get started early in the first week , but you do a lot of work and , after all , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is everything , but actually the text function will get there , and then I &apos;ll do something like that .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with every text function .
And then came along these new pages of study , the text that you do in a year .
And I knew that my common sense wasn &apos;t good enough .
It was a huge task .
I plan , I decided I would do something like this .
This is what it &apos;s going to look like this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of effort , in the middle of the months , and then I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and finally I &apos;m going to increase it a little bit like teaching .
How difficult will it be to learn to read ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
Go home and play , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a magnificent project .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then they would go home , and I had no script , and we were there .
And two months went by , which changed in two weeks .
And then one day I went and it was three days in the Did online , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote down 90 pages , did two streets , and people didn &apos;t have to go on two streets â€” humans were walking on a regular occasion , spending time in the classroom , and I put them on the radio .
I thought , now everything &apos;s gone .
A week later I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you jam ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to your ranch . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , it &apos;s the best . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was so generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is just amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago I started writing about lists .
I &apos;ve got six people glass all the time , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain makes a difference between six people and six people .
To find out that I made a leaf where I studied two brains of the same size , and the brain of the chest , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there has been some differences .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , you can &apos;t see this , but consider this .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Now both of these brains have long-held decisions , but the rest of the human brain is playful .
Now , what does this mean for a singer ?
It means everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work Challenging is a great time . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; Mind humans will decide to make some meaning , but they didn &apos;t like the project , so they took the comments , and they said , &quot; &quot; Keep your handwriting on the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and Tudor Hadfield , because I know it &apos;s happened right now .
( Laughter ) Then â€” ( Laughter ) â€” we &apos;ll go to the next level , and you &apos;ll see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , who &apos;s going to start talking about the race of talking to the World Trade Center , and very soon she ends up watching the videos of the Twin Bridge .
( Laughter ) It &apos;ll take a little time for all of those things , so it &apos;s not going to take time to do anything else today .
What a contract ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this isn &apos;t about the foundation of happiness that you want to outsource .
It just wants to be in the present .
It understands that the future doesn &apos;t have any idea , it &apos;s only two things : compassion and mercy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you can , and you spend your whole lives in fun and easy ways , then you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good sleep , and for generation , in the last few years probably looks like this .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed , well , it &apos;s not that long ago .
We are an improved civilization , and we don &apos;t even know it .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain that &apos;s deciding , aggressive people , that we can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are remotely isolated .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is share the experience that we have as happy .
Sometimes it seems just the right thing to do , that the easiest and the exciting thing to do is to eat , sleep or enjoy the opportunity moment .
Here &apos;s why we have a picture .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems counterintuitive to do what &apos;s difficult , for a major purpose .
And this is the critical agreement .
And for strangers , this contradiction always reaches the end , which spends more time in the shorter run , a simple and thriving path that &apos;s beyond the circumstances .
I call it a Dark Ages .
( Laughter ) Dark Ages are a place where strangers are so well-known .
There &apos;s an age when distraction should not be driven .
In the dark region that shows you that this is not a hot one , because it &apos;s not your right , it &apos;s a crime , a fear , a dark shadow , and it &apos;s all the characteristics of being in the right place .
The question is , in this way , when the principal heals up , how do the listeners get into the atmosphere , which is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that Sistine people are also defenseless , who always protect her in three dimensions â€” somebody said the home .
( Laughter ) Now , this household thing that &apos;s selling the most , but when the download comes , it becomes stigmatizing or the threat of embarrassment among people , job loss or scary results .
And the important thing is that the outside does it .
Now , this has been a real relation in my life , because six months ago TED people called me and they gave me the TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Apparently I did .
My dream was to be part of TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my intentions and mistakes , something else was going on in the brain that was making these decisions .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what the future will be like ?
We have to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian map at the bottom 20 feet and see the Indian map , we will only breathe when we don &apos;t see all India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided to celebrate their name .
I broke the web and there was a picture of me holding it back .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) Hospital reverberation , and in a few seconds , the entire system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember Kamal earlier , holding the bamboo staff , holding the bamboo staff !
Finally , and finally , long-term decision makers sponsored and I can start talking .
Now , the homeless shelter that talks about for every kind of serious hunger , someone like me would give two weeks for someone like me to start , and the beginning of the project is not going to be written , and then incredibly successful offers the unbelievable lesson of staying and writing .
And the acquisition of clearance at this point is what &apos;s called the system of strangers .
That &apos;s great , but not links can be done .
And a few years ago I decided to write about it .
When I wrote this , it shocked me on the side of my face .
I actually got thousands of emails from all over the world and from people , from different kinds of collisions .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , petitors and CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them said one thing and wrote : &quot; I am in front of this mess . &quot;
What surprised me was the number of emails polling and email address .
In the textbooks of these people , they would write about how SOLEs touched their lives , about what they did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are they all in black ?
Turns out there are two commonalities on the list .
I gave you three examples today , talking about things , all of them online .
And when the data is online , recent crimes are lethal because the household is accumulating .
But there &apos;s a second kind of river and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data .
So if you want a project that starts itself , like some sports or businesses â€” some sports or businesses , as long as you don &apos;t start paying attention to the vehicle , just to run .
There are also many other things that go along with that don &apos;t have to go on with your family , with your exercise , with your health , with your relationships , with your relationships , with whom you don &apos;t grow up .
Now , if the only way you can do a test is to find the stone tools you can do , it &apos;s difficult , because all of these data lines in the context of the stock market are losing .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do , and the good thing is that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s associated with a long-term appearance that comes in looking very little and that is talked about less than just a bad deal , a powerful deal of principle .
You &apos;ve got bed nets and rumors .
And this can be driven by the longer term of injury and refrigeration .
So I thought that was because of their email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not good enough for a plan .
The Taliban recruitment has formed them , sometimes in their own lives .
The trouble is not that they cannot fulfill their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and one thing that turned out to be â€” I don &apos;t think there are six people .
I think all of you are Scripture .
You may not have a very complex situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of you have had good relationships with the Dutch web , but remember the keyboards when the Dutch River doesn &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one last thought .
I call it the career of life .
Each block means one week , it &apos;s the new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been exported .
I think we all need to carry the candle .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the future , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to be careful .
It &apos;s crucial to all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that house there , probably we should start right now .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days of the U.S. and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan was passing out of Afghanistan and was passing out of a region of Afghanistan , helping a government office to secure an Afghan government office to provide a government office to protect its government , so that Afghan government could be helped to provide a government office to protect its government , a government office to some places ,
The military doctor arrived at the height of an assault and was surrounded by three men and with so many things , he noticed that you were born with the Copenhagen agen , the Copenhagen , and they were born with spears to protect the mosquitos and to extract the dead .
One of the people who lived there , one of the scholars and one of the scholars who was there , one of the scholars , was heading towards the hospital , and he was also heading towards the Himalayas .
In this case , it showed that the Copenhagen and Isaac are particularly interested in this mysterious facial melting of the heat .
They put it into a healthy cafeteria , and then you see what happens to the Copenhagen and then burn it first before they allowed others to rescue .
I looked at it and asked myself , where did people come from ?
What is this ? These are very depressing emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why it &apos;s the reason I work with people that I don &apos;t .
You know , you go to the polls and people who are yearning to experience themselves in order to benefit others .
In business , we put bonuses to people who are yearning to judge others so that we can make a difference .
We have an online calculation !
So I asked myself , where did such people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they get to the fire .
These outliers are drawn to this vision of mercy .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have the right environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , then each and every one of us has the potential to work together and make it larger that we have the potential to do this in others .
I &apos;m going to have the privilege of meeting with some of these people as we speak to yesterday and saying to me , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing , &quot; Because they do it to me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a profound sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are absolutely crucial .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not mutations .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; rescue me , &quot; &quot; and you do .
It can &apos;t be that I &apos;m giving two people a coordination and that &apos;s what they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
Where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years to the priests , which is to say the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of threats , all of these traditions , really , really focused on us .
There &apos;s no private thing .
Dream can be a scarce resource lack of resources , a long-term TEDster , and this is all working together to minimize the life span that this is all working together to reduce our life span .
And so that &apos;s why we &apos;re ready in social animals where we come together and work together as part of what I call a sacrifice , as in a tribe where we feel our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we were caring and working together in a natural way .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can slept and run overnight and see risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a world full of risks that are struggling to make our lives difficult or attempt to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; Our opportunities are failing to reduce our success .
It can lead to a higher degree of market insurance .
It can be a new technology that will stop your business strategy overnight and it can be a new technology that will stop you from doing your business in the first night .
Or it could be your struggle that you sometimes try to beat .
It &apos;s sometimes pushing you out of business , but at least it &apos;s driving your progress and trying to lead your business to lead you and it &apos;s stopping your progress and trying to lead your business to lead you .
We have no control over these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing and it will never be done .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is , because it believes that the orientation of the line .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in his organization and to live in a way that is supposed to protect the people in his organization and protect the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to assess their peace and lack of results so that people can live peacefully and feel secure and feel their personal relationships , they can hold things back .
I was traveling by horror , and I noticed in a moment that when a passenger attempted to get to the head of the line before he finished , and I noticed the staff on the doorway that he engaged in coming up with this man just like he did when he was awake .
Once upon a time , he was walked upon him , the first time he was able to walk upon him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep cutting things like this ?
Why can &apos;t you keep robes like us human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer back .
He doesn &apos;t trust his leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Virlines is not because they attract fashionable people to the top .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up their leaders .
You see , when conditions are overwhelmed , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and as a result , it shrills the organization .
What &apos;s going to be a great leader in terms of being the brightest example of a parent as a good parent is going to give it the best example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what would you want ? What does it create ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our children the opportunities , education , organization and record , when it is necessary , and we want to give our children the opportunities , education , organization and record , when it is necessary , to make them grow and to do more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people the opportunities , education , organization and record , and when it is necessary , they want to give people the opportunities , education , systems and record , when it is necessary , they want to create confidence in them , they want to give them the opportunities for time and disability so that they can make more progress than we &apos;ve ever imagined , so that they can make more progress than we &apos;ve ever imagined .
Charlie Kump , who &apos;s the head of a tech company in New York City , is CEO of a technology company called Next Jump , New York , and they say , if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever let your kid go ?
We never will .
So how can we get people out of our organization and then how can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charley has understood the role model of drug use .
If you work in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get much investment in the infrastructure of efficiency .
Instead , if you have a problem , they &apos;ll lead you and help you , in the same way that we would , for every kid who comes to school , take a C extra .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s the reason that so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are running through CEOs , and that &apos;s the reason that so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are running through CEOs , and that &apos;s because so many people are so angry and angry , some of the bankers are coming at the top of their head , who are not properly depressed and advising .
It &apos;s not about data .
They &apos;ve mastered the fundamental principle of addiction .
They &apos;ve gone through a great social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given risks to their well-being as children of their well-being , we know that they have ceased their well-being because of their well-being , but that they have ceased to sacrifice people for saving their well-being , but rather that they have ceased to sacrifice their people .
It &apos;s what gives us context , not data .
Can anyone guess how to get a $ 150 million piece of gold ?
Why don &apos;t you put it into 250 million dollars ?
Do we have a problem with it ? Absolutely not .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save data .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save data .
Instead , they will give people a shorter look at the data , but they will give people shorter data to save .
In the Bush administration , they &apos;ve run a mining company in the Bush administration called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they &apos;ve gone through a great deal of marketing , and they &apos;ve turned 30 percent of their drivers into bed .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they rarely overestimate their farmers .
They needed 10 million dollars to be saved , so many companies now come together and do the right thing .
And boy reacted to it .
You &apos;ll notice that bamboo is not trustworthy .
Instead , it &apos;s hard to believe in the cheating of the poor , and it &apos;s much harder to reduce the deaths .
And they built a dedicated program .
that every official , from the Scripture to the CEO , needs to be in a four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted to and didn &apos;t follow it .
But just as Bob has suggested the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said that it &apos;s better than all of us to experience a small amount of damage , than some of us would experience a lot of damage and a lot of attitude .
They &apos;ve saved 20 million dollars in this way , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , they have a natural responsibility for trust and collaboration .
And structurally , as nobody expected , people started to buy each other .
The ones that were most successful did not have the business with the successful families .
That is , somebody took five weeks to get the other one through three weeks .
Jump is an extreme , not a vessel .
I know so many people who benefit from organizations &apos;s leadership , I know so many people who are at the top of the pyramid of organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re good governments , and we do what they say , because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t track them .
And I know so many people across the board of organizations who have no privilege and be a real leader , and it &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and it &apos;s because they have the privilege of looking at the person on the left , and they have the privilege of looking at the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the foreign scientists that were out in the theater and just as the way the physicists are training you to eat in honor , and they &apos;re opening their hearts and saving nothing for it .
And when they returned to the field , his men gave her some of that food in order to eat , because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We tell them to lead .
We call them leaders because they receive threats from other people , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be preserved so that people can be preserved , and we call them leaders because they choose to be preserved so that their people can be preserved , we call them leaders because they choose to be preserved , so that people can be preserved , and so that people have good values , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people deserve to
They &apos;ll take our blood and our lungs and turn them up to see their dreams become real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your lungs and your heart to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this to us too . &quot; &quot; And is this not the organization that we would like to work with ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re going to like to do everything ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re going to like to do everything ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story of the Limpopo , the Limpopo , with the features of the Limpopo and the Mpumbai .
Where water and electricity are really irrational as a lifestyle , and it &apos;s really hard to grow up in these conditions at the age of 17 , I was working alongside friends in the winter to stay silent with my friends in the winter .
The sun is getting warmer in winter .
And as I was filling out the rubble , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no reason that you can &apos;t just touch the skin and you don &apos;t have to touch it ? &quot; &quot; I sat down , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I have to buy this . &quot; &quot; And I went home and I did some research and I found some amazing statistics .
Today , there are 2.5 billion people who don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Forty-four million of them are in Africa , and there are only in South Africa .
Different diseases accumulate in the atmosphere , the most dangerous of which is known as the tragedy .
One of the things that happens with the loss of the eye is that you can actually get injured by a more frequent decrease in the tragedy .
This disease consistently inspires eight million people every year , and the most scary thing is that you only have to give up your month to save a tragedy : no drugs , no gangs , no engineering .
After looking at the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then Ms. Parks emailed me out of her 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , no Internet , only 20 hours of Internet files on Google , and they were looking at people
And seeing this as a profound problem .
So , Mahatma &apos;s right , our family was ready .
Now we need to carry that out .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 page , and after I &apos;m writing my patent on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent troll in the country and â€” ( &quot; &quot; now and Miss ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mysterious exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need money .
( Laughter ) So after trying to make a difference in high school and the limited resources that I had , the Media University initiative brought in some new people , did some additional tasks , and now we have an impact on what &apos;s ready to build the market , we have access to the market .
We &apos;ve learned lessons from DryBath commercializing and reaching people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products much .
They just buy the names they need , and a guy in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket for the Senate , and he buys a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how you need more .
So we installed DryBath in these creative blocks .
You put it between you and the outside .
And the best part is that a simple replacement of a cow is only in five borders .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about the application of manufacturing .
We even want rich-world children to be DryBath â€” ( Laughter ) once in a week .
However , we &apos;ve felt that we can save 80 million liters of water every time they leave and we can save two hours for children , in the remote areas , two hours , more homes for every school , two hours for every second job , two hours for the kid to be .
After looking at global impacts , we learned from this about our main values of goods , security and security .
DryBath is a form of rich man and a life of poor man .
By staying in the process , now we &apos;re actually entering a phase where we &apos;re selling it internationally , which is going to put into the retail market , and one question I &apos;m going to ask you to consider for an audience , on the boxes of the Limpopo , in one week , revealing 50 bananas with an alphabet that doesn &apos;t have to go out to the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that , I haven &apos;t done that .
And more importantly , I learned a lot in the course of this whole thing , which was that Google discouraged me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I &apos;m still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that comes with this accounting , and the one thing that surprises me is why all of this money didn &apos;t want to be silent . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , I &apos;m here today to offer you some of the results that may surprise me and wonder who are the leading cause of the success of organizations , whose factors actually cause the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to create a better place in the world .
If you select one group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find all the human abilities that were once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the impossible possible .
But , if institutions are the best at all , why do most of the failures occur ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success in the beginning .
I wanted to investigate this , to reveal more organizations of frustration and false assumptions that had led me to some of the organizations in the last few years .
I wanted to know this because I was beginning a different business at the age of 12 , from New Jersey High School , going to kindergarten to high school when I built solar systems , then to college , when I built a low-end video .
After I graduated from college , I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started in Libya , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve made over 100 companies to make huge progress , massive progress .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to persuade theorists for the greatest cause of the success of organizations or of failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
And so that &apos;s why I called my company the Idea Libra the old moment that you feel about it .
Over and over again , I thought that maybe the team , the leadership or the organization , is much more important .
I never imagined that there would be a TED Talk coming out of the back of MIT , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a plan for everybody , until you don &apos;t have a mom in a month . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
The ability to acknowledge a team to move past cooking is critical .
Cooking is an objective reality .
So I thought that maybe the team has the most important value .
So I started to look at the business model .
Does an organization feel good about income ?
With this , I thought growing up in my mind the very key thing to success .
So think about capital .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
After this , of course â€” is it time ?
The idea came very quickly , and we were not ready for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;re coming in and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or is it too late , and already has more aggression ?
So I &apos;ve gone through a lot of respect for these five components in many organizations .
And the idea was that 100 companies in the Libya , 100 companies from the outside , were able to achieve a scientific result .
So before these ideas started , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” these are all billions of dollars of business .
Five companies down at the bottom â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we were hopeful , but not successful .
So I tried to look at all the characteristics , as I think these companies have made progress in these places .
So in the businesses outside Libya , I looked at strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here are some things : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a huge investment in the new companies , and sometimes there was a market model , but they couldn &apos;t do it .
I tried to find out that the highest impact of all of these companies was the success and the failure , and the result surprised me .
The first was a choice of time .
Right now , 42 percent is in the range of success and failure .
The idea of team and race is on the other hand , and then , being different from the idea , being unique , it &apos;s actually a third multiplication .
But the fact is , it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not true that ideas don &apos;t matter , but it &apos;s surprising to me that perception isn &apos;t the most important .
Sometimes it becomes more important when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the market model and investment comes in my mind .
I think the market model is too late , because you can start with a market model , and then you put it in a market mechanism .
And investment , if you had low investment in the start , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , is very easy to make investment .
I &apos;m here to give you some examples of the irregular power of all of these nations .
Take a major piece of Airbnb that everybody knows .
Now , notice that this company had lots of investors because people thought , well , who &apos;s going to put a product in your home ?
Of course , that proved the wrong thing .
One of the reasons why gross is the best market model , the idea , and the market mechanism is a right time .
This company came in in presenting the problems that people needed additional income , and it surely helped people respond to a banana in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
But , time was everything right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders were also yearning for additional income ; it was absolutely crucial .
Some things , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 , was around the time when companies wanted to look at their grandmother more .
We thought we were the best , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were too busy for it â€” working with lots of colleagues and some of the best commercials , working with the great Halloween Vartist .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband band was much lower .
It was so difficult to watch online videos , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser and what to do , and eventually this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and the Broad Bank was over 50 percent in America , it came at the best .
Great , good time .
Turns out , when YouTube started , it had no business model .
They weren &apos;t even sure it was going to work .
But he had a wonderful time .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
Ideas matter a lot .
But maybe time &apos;s choice is crucial .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really hungry for your prediction .
And the really unbelievable thing is that , outcomes don &apos;t come out of it , because if you like something , you should stay ahead , but in the time frame , you have to be very reliable .
As we &apos;ve said before , startups can change the world , they can create a better place .
I hope some of them will help you make your progress better , and then the world may not be the other way around .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 prize 3 , 2016 &#93; &#91; We saw the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; Fifth accents put up with rich , powerful people &#93; &#91; a small amount of money put into small companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We put it out to the Gulf Voters &apos; campaign . &#93; &#91; This week &apos;s revolution has been focused on the campaign of storytelling that brought the gi@@
And these papers by the Federal Bureau of Investigation did some of the little blind companies .
We have the villages , the banks and the churches , who come in with the fundraising firms , and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a vertical company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can look at the exchange of messages , you can see how they do it , how they do it .
The impact has already started to seem very significant .
The President of the United Nations has been known .
We also got the news that the poor desecrators of poor people are desecrating companies .
The revenue neutral revenue of two billion dollars is up to the main building of the Russian child by his friend , who is a famous cylinder .
And many , many rich people will be infected , and those that tell stories from then , are going to be at home .
Now this appears to be a story of a magic film or of a violent jihad with something to me .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that superheroes and superpowerful people sit in the seat of their pain and they shouldn &apos;t pay as much tax , which means that wealthy achievements like schools are getting paid less for health and education .
And this affects all of us .
For my organization , Galapagos Venture , it &apos;s an unbelievable discovery .
And global media and political leaders are talking about how people in shell companies have shared their influence with our decades .
I think it &apos;s a really cool world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to think about how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like a road map .
You can put another company inside a company , a second company inside , which is pretty much impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind this kid .
Companies for Disease Control , press , schools is hard to understand what &apos;s happening .
I think it &apos;s interesting , even in the United States , not very much .
Maybe it &apos;s not because of the stereotypical American population .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean there are no rich people in the United States who don &apos;t invest in shelter companies .
Through this , the road map is implemented , a few American cities from Moscow .
I think if we look at the discoveries of Kim Illind or the Wall or the nomad or the nomad , there are things that don &apos;t belong to the United States .
Instead , a lot of American citizens don &apos;t have to give much information , you need less information to get your company out of the Libra card .
This kind of crazy information is given to the students in the U.S.
Nine billion dollars of this is going to make it easier .
This kind of cross-pollination affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to see what this problem looks like .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we hooked up a department to try to fit over 13 ambulance companies in Manhattan .
Our legacy became the African minister who wanted to transport the village to America , a home , a ship and a neighborhood .
What was so mind-boggling was that all the vessels heard a one-way street simulation of how the vessels moved .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t create any cash for ourselves , and we didn &apos;t pay anybody any money , but this crazy idea of the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual wealth that talks about our hidden assumptions about quotation and proposal .
It &apos;s not just about a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Sydney .
This is a system that works , that clears off the grid , the lightning , the poverty and the inability .
And in order to control this , we have to change this game .
We have to change the rules of the game so that it can be difficult to create .
It can be ironic , so that what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think there &apos;s going to be some changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This was headed up on the political agenda , but the British Prime Minister Department of Division divided into eight seconds that happened in southern Ireland in 2013 .
And European Union is now putting together a central record of what &apos;s actually a country , or are controlling it .
The thing is , the I.S. is behind it .
Communication on a map of contradiction , contradiction in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to have as much progress as we needed , so we turned five .
We want to look at the innovations , the big sections , the big companies , that were used throughout the world and in the U.S.
This is a turning point in Galapagos .
The rhetoric of the citizens should be for the businesses who are known for their own clerical services , and the business leaders .
You know , they speak , they &apos;re not good for sustainability in this way . We do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to lobby for legislative change to transparent information .
We can aggregate this privacy section which is responsible for the cutting and the bullying .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s been said that Look , your invention , has had a much wider understanding of the documents in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , can it be true ?
This is a legitimate thing â€” isn &apos;t it ? â€” that the media of the world is showing a very poor performance of a small group of workers getting together in a way that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you stay ahead of them ?
Julie Singer : Yes , these are â€” I can say it to you â€” public services are provided in the right ways , and we have so many ways to get the information back to us .
So we use a lot of high-end lists to extract the materials from one place to the Internet , to clear the signs from legal contracts like Sweden and Bill .
We get information packaging , through regular Doc , through Ramadan syndrome , through whatever it is , through regular news organizations , frame â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about presenting huge information to a public and then protecting yourself against the inevitable legal and political empowerment .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to try to make sure the document is true , but you actually never know what the tool is .
Julie Singer : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ve all heard that at some point in time . And if we get to the stage , we can pretty easily disprove the information .
( Cheering ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s obvious , and we &apos;re asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Take an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you invented a few years ago .
If we can see it up there .
So this is a story from Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and then what happened ?
Julie Sung : Yes , that is the report .
It was a secret magic report that the state of Kenya was prepared after the 2004 elections .
Before 2004 , the government had 18 years of digital harvesting .
He was an ambulance in Kenya .
And when he arrived at the power of the book â€” these powerful forces that were trying to bridge the Kenyan creation , they spent 20 million pounds on this report and one on the other .
And then the government was sitting at it and using it for its political will , which was the wealthiest man â€” now is the wealthiest man in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ of Kenya .
That &apos;s why it was made in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this by the very first election ever in December of 2008 .
When we went to that report , three days after we decided to become a friend from the new president , Kabul , who was the devastating person , Daniel Aramu , so he turned to the report and he was in the Gulf of Cairo .
CA : And â€” so I mean , to put it very briefly , this is basically â€” this was spread in Kenya , not by prostitution , but by the way , and by your character , it changed the outcome .
Julin Sangling : Yes . This is the headlines in Gaddafi , and then it spread across all the major countries of Kenya , in the Tanzanian and South Africa newspapers .
It came from the outside .
And he , after a few days , promised the Kenyan press relief that they could talk about it .
And this blog was on the TV 20 days of January , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the vote , according to an online gender report in Kenya , and it changed the effect of voting .
CA : Wow , has that really changed the world ?
Julin Sung : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : There you go . We &apos;re going to show you a little bit of a clip of something called a headwind video .
It &apos;s long , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This â€” I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-end video .
Radio : ... bitterness , when you first told them to brush .
I found that , oh , there are four with them .
The path is clear . Now it &apos;s OK . Gill &apos;s going .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me . Walk .
Hello everyone .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Gill running . Gill walks . ( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost .
Hatel â€” two great motors , two great mothers .
We should just walk . It &apos;s time !
Alright , we killed eight people now .
Here we see two Hilly Keepers , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Raleigh . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re on the grass .
Oh , what a contract . What was going on ?
God beat you , His name . Okay . Hi , I beat them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julian Sangling : the people who worked on it had a very strong impact on it .
We ended up doing a study where two people were distracted .
These were the first in three cases that happened .
CA : So 11 people in the attack , two people on the global rides ?
Julian Sangling : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two small children were killed .
It &apos;s basically 18 to 26 people .
CA : And you made a fuss about it .
What was the primary cause of the anger , you think ?
Julian Sangling : I don &apos;t know , I think people can self-see the extraordinary inequality of power .
There are people on the one hand in the Gulf , and then , about a kilometer away , Hillel Kepler starts pouring over 30 miles of gallons of electricity on anyone â€” any brilliant â€” and giving talents to the rescue parents .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t there at all , because they were volunteers .
CA : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadband Manning was arrested , and it &apos;s said that he announced in Chester Rome that he had made this video for you by 280,000 and half American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sangling : So we decided to accept the document .
Five days ago , it was sentenced to receive over 150,000 documents and 50 cards .
But we &apos;ve gone back and forth to the beginning of the year in Ramadan and the American safety house , but there is no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safari room .
CA : I mean , if you brought thousands of accents to the American safety network ...
Julie Singer : We &apos;re going to take them out . ( CA : Will you do it ? ) Julie Singer : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) JL : Because things like this show that actually , what Arabs are going to do is fight human rights in these states .
If you look at hidden documents , these types of material are in them .
CA : Please play it out .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you create hidden information ?
Julian Sung : Yes , the question is how important information in the world is , what acquisition can be .
There &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out of the way , when you expect it to be good , because the companies know it better , and they know about it , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that is the history of press .
CA : But are there risks to this as an individual , or as a collective , mind-blowing society ?
Julian Sangling : We didn &apos;t have the documents with them .
I mean , our big culprits are great .
With data , we can extract the information in a very personalized way â€” the information that &apos;s available to someone else &apos;s source .
But there are also some secrets . For example , your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret â€” but we &apos;re talking about civic goods that come next and that are fueled by jihad .
CA : Well , they &apos;ve done it with a passion .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , a father whose daughter is in the United States military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you expressed something that some people like to hug other people .
Here &apos;s an American philosophy of the dead .
Which results â€” but it has put millions of people worldwide who are American philanthropy .
While they &apos;re not , my son isn &apos;t , who &apos;s going to say that ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julian Sangling : Here &apos;s how we get asked so many questions .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , in Afghanistan â€” people don &apos;t have to watch videos , they look at it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what they &apos;re feeling , it doesn &apos;t really matter what they &apos;re feeling .
Because they look at it every day .
It will change their frame and their frame of reference for this , and that is our hope .
CA : OK , so you seem to be hopeful for what you think is the hidden information of companies and governments .
That &apos;s great .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light , you have to maintain privacy as such as your own criteria ?
Julian Singer : No , not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not all different cells .
We don &apos;t have the information that &apos;s copied from other media .
If they do that , then we have a very difficult situation , but we &apos;re doing the same thing that people are ethically comfortable with being honest about whether they &apos;re doing it tomorrow .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , we &apos;ve made a difference â€” this is to get the visibility high .
You might imagine that there would be different kinds of breakthroughs about the lions and the elephants .
One is a hero of hope .
It could be a problem .
What does the hero look like ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Sung : Oh ! There &apos;s something you should be doing .
CA : These are great people , Julie , great .
We have to try and do . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done that for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , a little old story , isn &apos;t it ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanguay : This is a model of what we do almost every day .
Last year alone â€” in November , there were major radio waves in the Bahamas , as in the Gulf Mexico , but not so big .
And we got the Report Mile â€” what was going on was a very good analysis of this â€” which was to say that actually , different conservation companies had different oil companies dealing with different oil companies that helped them stop there and seize them .
And it had to be run by the Victorians , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report . That &apos;s why we had a very difficult job .
We couldn &apos;t predict it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , well , maybe this is a company that &apos;s playing this all in a game .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know at all , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it seems right to look , but we can &apos;t make predictions of it . &quot; &quot; Then we got a letter in the same week that he wrote , he wanted to take out the tool . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to take the tool . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What documents are you talking about ?
Can you show how much money you actually have on it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they brought us the little guy that we see on Scripture with his name , the microProfessor , with the DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This happens a lot .
This is our way of revealing and predicting what the material is , and this is to get the letters out of these people .
CA : All right . So , have you ever had any information available under the computer ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we &apos;re accumulating and rewarding actions like the harsh process .
So our initiative to publish this has become instrumental in the last few months because we &apos;re refining our buck system right now because of the rare national waste that we have .
This is the rain .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s been around , we &apos;ve been able to connect more with ourselves because of our growth , and that means we have a large number of public services that are affordable , but we don &apos;t have as many people to organize and educate all of this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , for the purpose of a journalist or a journalist ?
Julie Sung : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to fix , because with the types of material we have to deal with , we have to rebuild the institutions so that we can get people together that really make a lot of sense of the local conservation effort , and then make a little sense of the problems .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about your own identity and how you come at that job .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that true ?
Julian Sangling : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the city , so the two reasons were affected .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychiatrist , so this is basically saying that together , everything can be done can be done with just mental illness .
Julie Sung : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were just a little bit younger and you got into the workforce very quickly .
Julie Sung : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very early age .
I wrote a letter , and I learned that at the time that the crime was on me .
So you need to appreciate the word and bring it up .
I mean , there &apos;s a way â€” there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Rockefeller that &apos;s using the Rockefeller theory to control the banks of your grandmother .
That &apos;s why the word is now not as good as the word it was before .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think of your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps an event in your life that helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in facts .
But the basic values : good , talented people don &apos;t generate the victims ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some other brilliant , aggressive people who are in my life .
CA : Brilliant , brilliant people don &apos;t make a mutant contribution to their development ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m an old man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow â€” there &apos;s another way of reaching the monkey , which is approaching the police , has crime .
And this is what has been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So we have to just say this in the last few years : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , what you &apos;ve done there is you &apos;ve taken something , you &apos;ve taken a banking problem , you &apos;ve turned it into a newspaper and you &apos;ve turned it into a defense of your story .
Instead , they saw your situation .
Which made you very famous in the Old South , what happened then ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ice Lands had a crisis .
He was the most powerful of all .
The banking sector grew 10 percent of the country &apos;s GDP .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the state of Tehran ran ran five minutes before the press , including a film like this : &quot; Terrific News on the desk , and the state of New Reader was saying , &quot; This is never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed up the web , put the time out , and we became so famous in Ice Land , I went and talked about this problem .
And the chapter for the people there was that they shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the Ice Leaders , some international experts , worked with some other international experts , we proposed a new kind of Asian Leader &apos;s law for a kind of freedom media , so it was kind of like a Freedom Media , the most secure place for journalists all over the world , for new Ne@@
A native state of the nation state is like Noora , which means the system is heading up from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Alliance parliament celebrated this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you think there &apos;s more expectancy to show power and power , greater privacy , or to see us excellent power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julian Sangling : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will come .
I mean , there &apos;s more pressure to be made to agree with the laws of liberty and the laws of transparency , globally â€” between Europe , in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What &apos;s that got to do ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so this is a really interesting time to live â€” because with a short effort , we can move past it or move on .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the icons of the audience into something called , the judges , with respect , and all your power .
Julie Sung : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did that , the leather .
I used to gaze through the rubble of my childhood client and look at the rubble of the wheel .
When I was growing up and I came back home in the early &apos; 90s , I started to realize this .
My team broke .
And when I looked at it from the personal lens , it sort of struck me how the rest of the world thinks about it ?
And when I went to the Gulf camps , wherever I &apos;d gone , surprisingly , to North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or to the state of London , I noticed that there were four creatures on the island of Venus â€” yellow , dark , silver and code .
And I thought that was kind of strange , and I was wondering if anyone else had a copy of this curriculum .
And when I went to visit him , I realized that people are not looking at these character teams .
Ordinary people look at something like this .
To confine the natural world with a few elements , there is no unusual human characteristics .
We did that 10 thousand years ago when we first came out of our caves .
If you look at the Hole in 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these creatures are colliding and bumping .
But if you look at the previous 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see just four animals : snakes , cows , lions and elephants .
It &apos;s true for the elders .
So if you look at mines 150 or 200 years ago in New York City , you &apos;ll see cartoons like bananas , beer and southern areas .
But if you look at the remoteness of today , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re only going to be four years old â€” wheat , herd , but also maneuverable .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shaheen .
This is a brand new problem .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing over the last 50 years .
The second great war has given us the greatest inspiration to become heroes .
During the great war , we developed technologies like SOLEs , Kallikuppam , or Huxley , for all of these things .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have seen the dramatic increase in the ability to move forward .
But it &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that military farming and sea farming have increased , and then in a two-year period , its revenue grows from global warming .
Now if you collect the fishing and the military counterparts , it &apos;s going to be the same as two Chinese counterparts per year from the sea .
In fact , using Chinese characters isn &apos;t a agreement , because China is not only the largest country , but it is also the largest border .
Let &apos;s move to our four choices .
The first is the largest user of sea slugs in the U.S. and the West .
The Gulf is an extremely bad predictor .
It kills five , 10 , or 15 pounds-worth of Gaddafi to the market .
The Indus Valley also has an unbelievable level of honor .
In a study done at the Dutch University , it showed that reading hydrocarbons from house to house is incredibly ineffective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
The remaining battles in areas of war are the Mongolian war .
Take a look at these beautiful patterns .
They check the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protecting the beach , clearing it , clearing it away , and building all sorts of important things for the atmosphere .
Some of this has happened with the management wars .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years building up millions of iceberg .
A second process that &apos;s going on over here , what the Philippines call &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; Almost everything on the track is you &apos;ve seen , it &apos;s very controversial .
Today , what &apos;s happening is that the leather begins to deteriorate from the nose , but with so much , so many other leather goods can be turned into cooking .
And most of the time , we &apos;ve been working on slaughterhouses that are called &quot; &quot; the raincow . &quot; &quot; This is the vehicle that we &apos;d like to see on the beach , which means changing it into food , which means that the ecosystem is opening and producing yourselves .
Later on , we have to feed the second largest meal of food in the United States and the West .
Titan is a global trance .
You need to look at large areas of the world to organize like this .
We have an area called the ICCAT â€” the International Committee for Climate Protection .
And the great appreciation of all the tech .
We can farm clouds , but it &apos;s not good enough for the tuna fisheries .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tattoos get hot .
He can 340 miles an hour , and he can keep his body warmer than 20 degrees Celsius .
The net charge on this slide is nearly complete .
A fresh blood supply is a byproduct that doesn &apos;t slow down very quickly .
This is the best for proteins .
But those wild creatures that survive on 440 miles an hour are not able to live in the farm .
Summer is a good load , needless to say , has been fallen out of the sea .
This is my own political connectome .
Connect was running through the forests .
If you look at a map of the connectome , every data is a document .
In the politics of Connect there are 3,000 more drugs .
In fact , I say there &apos;s more people in concrete â€” ( Laughter ) â€” if anyone is open to the power of concrete , then I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere , these are the rockets that discourage children from wanting to give .
As a result , we have a successful breakthrough for our partners and for our community funding .
When the space shuttle began , Sami had to spend six pounds of Western leather to make a tent .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
Conversely , it &apos;s a little bit too wrong , because if you look at the footage of footage , they name the Zimini people in a football game .
Whereas this Fox is supposed to be very popular with leather .
It &apos;s hard to say something about chocolate and alcohol .
But there &apos;s also the whole market mechanism , the whole market mechanism , that has invested in tar sands .
This system equates to producing cooking , which is a geothermal property .
This goes back seven percent per year .
Even though we spend less money on getting to the market , we save less , but then we get a lot of money .
We don &apos;t just raise the eggs either , but we raise the eggs and the goods .
We have what &apos;s producing leather and also what &apos;s producing leather .
Because the blood vessels and blood vessels and so on begin to pay the bills .
I wonder if there &apos;s a mosquito that bears the skin and has cleared the mustache .
India was already or dying . ( Laughter ) As a result , it was a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third piece of China or the entire U.S. , that &apos;s getting out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philippines actually began as a lifetime .
And it started to look like a local entrepreneur who had just noticed that the next day , nobody would ever be on the market .
He goes to the park and says , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
For the oceans , for the most part , it was only proven to be Hebrew nor Jews .
So he made his own lifetime scenario .
The census , unfortunately , was over 30 seconds .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter cylinder , so he brought in the eight-cent code .
This is the largest mass-market art industry in the United States , with two to three billion pounds of electricity every year .
If we stop the policies , the alternative candidates might be trivial .
Twenty years ago , there was nobody for Italy .
This is changing the plasma protons in vitro proteins in many ways , and this is preventing the third world .
Actually , this is a very sustainable solution ; in nine months it &apos;s being grown from an individual .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a waste product .
It &apos;s not limited to the iPad and DNA that we think will be keeping us alive all the time .
So what do we do about it ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That &apos;s a large sample of about 30 million tons .
One possibility that conservation community raised is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of giving people a road ?
There are problems for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the market of India , a typical part of slavery against lying , and the more effective parts of the Indian prize .
It &apos;s October 3 , the EPA and the CDC .
So here &apos;s her potential .
But what if , instead of taking our way , we could pay for a few dollars , pay for it , pay for it , and then we turned it into a footprint , and we could pay for the leather , and we could make the leather better for the monthly food ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that household appliances .
They have much more EPACs and ADHD .
The calculation is very effective .
The measurements for meat are only thirds of what &apos;s produced to meat the market .
Actually , there &apos;s about three that don &apos;t come out of the sea .
The sea level rises by three , so it just collects them .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our West Bank , however , we have been pushed out because of the use of science and technology .
Over the past 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been born , these are the number one cause of death in the sea .
And as you might think about clips , there are more than three proteins and more than three that are highly effective signs .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can create a lens that can help us reveal the hidden proteins .
These creatures must be vegetarians , so they can grow and adapt to their growing and changing environment in a way that is shaped like a waste stream , and they want to be EPA , DHA , Omix3 and Gateshead .
It &apos;s still in paper .
I &apos;ve been replicating these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I say that , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do that . We can do that .
But try to do that .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we do that , then the third part of the world &apos;s population is nearly 30 million in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all just happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , the problem is catching up .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was in the big part of the brain to read , because I have a brother who &apos;s a neurological illness deficit .
Growing up and later , I wanted to understand , as a scientist , how can I connect my dreams with my own reality and make my own dreams ?
What happened to my brother &apos;s brain and Scotland was that they didn &apos;t join their dreams with the public and with the public realities , and they worked on it .
So I spent my life studying serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked at the Pranitha Financial Bank , which was in the field of medicine at Harvard .
So what &apos;s the difference in people &apos;s brains that were seeking to answer genetically is what &apos;s the difference in people &apos;s brains that are typically imagined as being compared to people &apos;s brains in Scottish , or Xizophobia , or poorer studies ? So what &apos;s really trying to do is make a map of the brain &apos;s microbial map , whose cells are messing up the &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the
So there was a lot of detail in my life because I was doing this kind of research in the day , but on a Friday and Saturday afternoon , I was traveling by the United Nations as a result of these antennas .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I was going to go find out that I was faced with an intellectual desk .
There was a nine-way street in my brain .
And over the next four minutes , I watched my brain become completely disconnected with any knowledge whatsoever .
This morning , I was able to read and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever looked at the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I brought a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the final part of the brain which is associated with the left side of the brain , and this is how it &apos;s going to stay in my mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain are completely identical to each other .
Now , those of you who think computers , on the right part of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain acts like a serial processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the cross-body , covering some 300 voluntary profits .
But nevertheless , the two components are complete .
Because they understand information in a different way , knowing that each part of their identity knows a totally different kind of information , and if you allow them to open , then I think their identities are totally different from each other .
Compassion . Thank you . That &apos;s it .
SOC : Yes , there &apos;s more .
( Laughter ) The only part of our brain is thinking about this moment .
Right now , part of our brain is thinking about these brain pictures , and they &apos;re thinking about physiologically with the movements of our body .
Information is gathering and mapping throughout our body through the neurological system , and then it &apos;s repeating itself into a great Islamic classroom that we can see in the current moment how to feel and how to feel in the mind .
I &apos;m an energy that &apos;s routinely outperforming from its surrounding energy through the right brain of the right brain .
We are the brainwaves of energy that are connected to each other through the consciousness of the right part of the brain , as a human family .
And at the moment , we are brothers from this planet who are responsible for making the world better .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and wonderful .
The left side of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and figuratively .
The rest of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is showing us taking our current great album / Class , analyzing it and then starting to collect analyses .
It also organizes and facilitates all of this information that is going on in the past , all of the things that we &apos;ve learned and all the possibilities of the future , namely , regulating the impact on our plans .
The symptoms of our brain are thought of in language .
It &apos;s this continuous talk that draws us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that , you know , you have to remember to buy and go home and buy .
I need them tomorrow . It &apos;s a mind of me creating my book of mathematics that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice she says , &quot; I am ! I am ! &quot;
And as my left brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become deeply grateful .
I become the only person around me with huge power and passion .
And that part of my brain , that morning , was dead on the floor .
On the morning of the judge , my left eye slammed into the back of my eye with a dramatic pain .
It was this sort of heartbreaking , almost like the Asian piece .
And that pain that sort of warped me and left me behind .
He goes back and forth .
For me , it was an unusual thing that never occurred to me , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing . I start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I sat down and I held myself on a scale and I put myself on a card field , which is a typical body training machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it feels like I &apos;m the fingerprint of an early man who &apos;s touched by the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre , &quot; &quot; and then I look back on my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is the big , unusual thing . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the way I had changed my mind , which is the general sense of what I &apos;m a human being is doing out of this experience , but now I was a very humble and unfinished place in which I was conscious of the experience .
And it was all very strange , and I was just blowing my head up .
So I got out of the machine and I started walking through the room and I realized that things had happened in my body .
And everybody sees a really difficult and thinkable thing .
I have no correlation in my speed , and I think there &apos;s a correlation in the direction of a House , so I just have to focus on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my living room staring at the bottom of the water , and I &apos;m actually listening to a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice saying yes , my brother has to play you now .
Yes , your leg gets dry and then I &apos;m not balanced , so I roll into the wall .
I look back and I see my hand , and I realize that I now cannot repair the damage of my body .
I have no idea where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going , because my hands are supposed to be made up of atoms and molecular walls .
If I knew anything , that was energy ...
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my brain that &apos;s pretty quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice on the Romotive Control .
A silver lining .
First of all , I was fascinated by the violation of my brain .
But then immediately , as I saw in another light switch , I discovered the energy in this huge umbrella of air that surrounded me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt my great awe and my strong ability .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
And then one of the first things that happened was the right part of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re in trouble . &quot;
We should be helpful , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really in charge of any problem . ( Laughter ) Looks like I &apos;m really in charge of a problem , but I &apos;ve come back immediately in the same consciousness that I &apos;m calling for a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think about how beautiful it is in which you are totally interconnected with this tiny brain that surrounds you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere that I work , and I &apos;m getting pressure about it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And look at all the relationships you have from the outside world and from that , and the depression has been lost .
And I felt a sense of urgency .
And measure what it would look like if you were removed from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you stayed with .
( Laughter ) Oh , I was just raised as a welder .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got to the left side of my brain and he said , &quot; Hey , let &apos;s break two . &quot;
We need someone , and I &apos;m thinking , should I be helpful to this , so I reclaimed from a secret home and I &apos;ve been keeping a machine gun until I &apos;ve walked into my office now and I &apos;m thinking , can I reach myself and drive ? &quot; &quot; And that moment my hands were completely broken .
It was then that I understood that my God was holding me into a college attack , the next thing my mind tells me is how powerful this thing is !
( Laughter ) How awesome !
Some brain scientists are going to have this opportunity to explore their own brain , and they &apos;re going to go in there . ( Laughter ) Then one hour came to my mind . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into a college . &quot; &quot; So I thought about that .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the philanthropy attacks , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll return to my habit . OK .
I have to call for help . I have to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the first job . Then I remember I had my bike record with my phone number .
So I go into my study room and I create a three-dimensional motor card .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card at the top , even though I can see it with my naked eyes and see what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s my card , because I can &apos;t see a single cord .
And words were held by punch cards and punch cards , and I wasn &apos;t reading anything .
And then I started waiting for him to describe what I &apos;m calling the book of interpretation .
And at that moment , the typical truth was repeated and I found that it wasn &apos;t the cards , it wasn &apos;t the cards .
It took me about 45 minutes to decrease the slide .
And in those 45 minutes , the effects of the allocation went up to the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I have no way .
So I take the phone and I put it up there .
I took the Bismarck , and I put it there , and now I &apos;m seeing all the little blobs on the cards look like little girls on the phone .
But then I turn to my own lender when I came back , I remember I didn &apos;t remember putting that number up .
So I took my little fucking hand like a giant and stuck it on the sides of the other hand and comforted these girls to come back to the normal truth , so you can tell me that I had just arrived in India just before , and I heard that the telephone was on the cockpit , and a singer on my nose picked up a phone and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And
So I say this in my mind clearly , &quot; I &apos;m talking to you , I need help . &quot;
And from my voice , there &apos;s something like &quot; &quot; Woo . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like the Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he came to me that I didn &apos;t know I could speak a language at the time , that I couldn &apos;t understand when I didn &apos;t try .
So he figured I needed help , and he helped me .
Shortly after that , all four orphans were going to Boston on a hospital on the other end of the hospital .
I walked down and looked like the children of a small beer .
Just like the story that just happened to the rest of the world and just suddenly out of poverty , I pull the energy out , and I feel the warmth .
And that moment made me realize that I &apos;m not alone in my life .
Or perhaps the doctor has saved me and offers me a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I finished , I was surprised to learn that I was alive .
When I felt the power of my spirit , I gave life to God .
Now my brain has been hijacked by two opposite truths .
It was then that my emotional system started to become more empathetic , more just with pain .
Like the fire in the forest , my brains were so close and so strong that I could barely hear a voice coming in because of the background , or even a voice coming in , and I was just pedaling further .
Because I had no way of tracking my body , I could not quite understand , so I felt really superior and wide , like a person who was freed from my belly .
And my spirit has been unleashed , like a great event melting through the ocean of dirty water .
Great Neuron .
I found that quality that matters .
And I remember thinking it would never be possible that I would be able to find my own great desire to learn from within the small body .
But then I realized , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m alive !
I &apos;m alive , and I &apos;ve been blessed .
And if I &apos;ve been incarcerated and I &apos;ve been alive since then , whatever life is capable of getting neurons and seeing a world that is filled with beauty , compassion , commitment and love , people who know they can sometimes feel this quality .
And they can come in and they can make a choice : When they want to go back to the left of their brain to look for transparent quality .
And then I understood how awesome this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a glimpse of what was the culture that had taught me to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a period of diarrhea , the southern seasons , they cleared the blood vessels off my brain &apos;s spinal cord , which was maintaining the intensity of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real subject in my life .
It took me six years to complete health .
So who are we then ?
We are the most powerful forces of modern life with advanced skills and two extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step right in my own consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe . I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful cells are made up of organic , one cell culture that everybody has .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness , where I become an individual , in a deep sense .
From the quantum leap , &quot; &quot; he said .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
Inside me is we are .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
And I think as long as we spend our left-hand correspondence on the right-hand corner of the brain , we will increase world peace , and our planet will be so safe .
And I thought that was worth spreading .
Thank you .

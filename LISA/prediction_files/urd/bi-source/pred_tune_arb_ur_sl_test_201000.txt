Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They took my name for my name , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
Nobody ! Nobody ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little while ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends , and I was forced to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have any food in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he had to be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Syria ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The heart of food , the heart of compassion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; He said .
He was speaking to me , as he was saying to himself , &quot; If this were the last girl in the world , I would not see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; meaning in Arabic ?
A boy , a boy , took two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can he speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I began to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough !
What is it that makes me feel so proud of speaking my own country ?
Where could that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I have many people like me who come to such lengths in their lives where they routinely leave out everything that &apos;s in their minds , just because they love to say , and they &apos;re terrible .
Should I drive my whole culture , my ideas , my spirit and my spirit ?
We may have the most important battle stories to tell our children .
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
How does that make sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that kind of recurring choice as what he did for me .
The Arabic language does not ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or research , or language that we use in uniforms , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language we observe when we work on a research program , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use anywhere in the world .
If we do that , they &apos;ll roll up our pile .
So where can I communicate this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
This is a reality .
But the second most important fact we need to think about .
Arabic is the language of the mother .
Research says that in other languages , you need to translate your mother &apos;s language to acquire skills .
In other languages , the teacher of language is the primary means of creativity .
How ?
Giant cells , when he first started writing , were the applications of Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imaginations and philosophy were influenced by a little girl in a village where she grew up , felt a sense of purpose , a certain voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn the English texts , you feel the same blessing , the same feeling .
You can imagine that this is also their gift in English , this little boy who lives in those areas , just in one of the coats of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China all of these things are happening .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in resources , they spend a lot of money on dissemination and consumption .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this emerging mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to get to this developing world .
They were countries like us in an era , but they decided to try to grow , study , and they went to countries like Turin , employee and so on , and they settled their own language as if they were leaving the schools , as if it were yesterday .
They kept it near them .
Because if you &apos;re a product of a tower or a leather , and it &apos;s not in the toilet , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be included in these offices , unprecedented offices , like we are more time .
So to create new inventions and applications , they needed to store their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Rain , altruism , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a sign of a very specific set of steps in our lives , and words that are beyond our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Consciousness , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will produce a special song in your brain that has special emotions for a given day in a unique history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What does our minds do ?
How would you say you understood it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereign , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the age of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about insurance .
It &apos;s that affections remind us of a particular thing .
A friend of mine is a French speaker who has borrowed from a French .
I was asking him one more time .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to cook his wife and translate it , I woke up one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; crap . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Cruelty women would call it &quot; &quot; crap , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He wondered , how could it be so obvious ?
Does she want to self-destruct ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of many examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his husband , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me fireworks , and one night , I tried to translate it into what it feels like to feel when I hear the fireworks . &quot; &quot; Bert woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have already raised my hand and why you have it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; And because you are me , I have put my hand and I have left
He translates it . He shows me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to convey the Arabic language ?
We turned it into a perceptual shift for society , and we started a protector of Arabic language .
As many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Leave the cold , slow down . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protection campaign heard a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak it in language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do that because , you know , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone says to me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in a way that reflects our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
The letter is the same as ours and the same as ours .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; Get the right sign .
Very simple but powerful and effective .
After that , we started another campaign using the landscape of the letters on Earth .
You see an example outside , a context in which the letter is in the back of the yellow box , with the label , &quot; Discard Language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill ourselves .
If we kill our language , we have to have a knowledge for ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And this lack of opportunity to create modernity and compassion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; Kal &quot; &quot; is a picture of boys and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve sent the word &quot; &quot; college . &quot; &quot; They want to make as much audio as they want to make two points , but I have to give them the same word that &apos;s good and the same truth .
I &apos;m not going to go online and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m living in the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not money ! We shouldn &apos;t be saving yourself .
But to get to that point , we all need to convince everybody that we &apos;re not going to let anyone go bigger or that we think our language has a right to us , to push ourselves or to challenge our patients and to think .
Our idea has to be created .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not replicate the skeleton , we can still be creative .
Right now , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to invent in your mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start with this time .
They &apos;re either a nano or a short film .
A single neuron can then be located on a global scale .
He can re-branch Arabs first .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we have to know that , and we have to think that the solution is there , part of the solution is our guess .
By the way , what can you do today ?
How many of you are Twittering ?
In Hebrew , I urge you , although , my time has passed , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the English alphabet , doesn &apos;t write the Arabic alphabet !
( Applause ) It &apos;s expensive ! It &apos;s no language .
You enter a virtual world with a linguistic language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here for the interest of the need for language conservation .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , speaks in a language of her father .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I blame my daughter for sharing in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot;
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You just get this culture of copy . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that it reminds us of the deepest mystery that our existence is no secret , that the negative impacts of my people are starting to waste , even when you saw my generation stop banking and we &apos;ve gotten terrible at the expense of this generation of inequality that doesn &apos;t make our generation more popular until they &apos;re set out to give women , as much as
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , my primary career was a gardening service , which meant I had multiple signs .
Now a normal person , when they write something , will do something like this .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll do the job quickly , but in the first week , you &apos;re doing a lot more work , and then more work later , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I would like to do that .
Here &apos;s my approach .
All of my responses will be ready , but in fact , the text function will reach the top , and then I will do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every text .
And then there &apos;s a whole new paper published , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal vocation wasn &apos;t good enough for this kind of reaction .
It was a huge task .
I planned , I decided I would do something like this .
This year , something like this will happen .
I &apos;m going to start small , middle months , I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and finally I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard is learning going to be ?
There &apos;s no big thing , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Come on and beat , and I cannot do more .
So we created a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were just there .
And two weeks went by , two months passed , two weeks passed .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in the DRC , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I wrote 90 pages , I went on two streets and I did things — people shouldn &apos;t go on two streets — people shouting in a hallway , spending time in the hallway , and putting it all online .
I thought , well , it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the paper . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got it so far . That &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was very profound . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very good .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My head always kills six people and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s happening in the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis was that the brain makes differences in six people .
To find out , I took a leaf blood vessel where I could be able to see both brains and stroke the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look carefully and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained mother , that &apos;s not so expensive , but consider it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Both of these brains have decisive decisions , but the stereotypical human brain exists in a fun way .
Now , what does this mean for a singer ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work saves a good time . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; Mind people will make decisions to make meaningful decisions , but they didn &apos;t like this project , so they borrowed it , and he said , &quot; &quot; Please read the chapter of Charles &apos; page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and Tim Harderel , because I know it &apos;s happened right now .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we go to the pub , and you &apos;ll see something added in 10 minutes ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , which will start with the conversation about the race of Richard &apos;s face , and much later on , it will end up watching the videos from Tony &apos;s mother .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take some time to do all of these things , so it &apos;s not going to take much time to do anything else today .
What &apos;s going to be the deal ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the foundation of compassion that you want to call .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It has no vision of the future , but it &apos;s only two things : compassion and enthusiasm .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all right .
If you know and you spend your entire life going forward and easier , you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and increasing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened in the past .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed , the continent isn &apos;t too far off .
We are an increasing educator , and we don &apos;t know .
That &apos;s why we have another person in our brain , a smart person to decide , that we can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is make it happy to do .
Sometimes it seems just as simple and emotionally engaging to eat , sleep or emotional from moments of opportunity .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s so confusing .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is a climate agreement .
And for strangers , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends a lot of time at stake , a very simple and sustainable path that thinks it &apos;s out of the back .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) The dry land is a place where strangers are very well known .
There is a tendency at the time when obligation should not be a director .
In the dark region that you see that doesn &apos;t really correspond to you , because it &apos;s not just your right , it &apos;s a crime , a fear , an emotion of hatred , and it &apos;s all those properties that are in the right order .
The question is , in that way , when the source is heavy , how do the system develop into the atmosphere that is less happy but more important ?
It turns out that hundreds of people are also conservationists , who are always protecting it at precise times — someone called it household .
( Laughter ) Now , this is a household thing that &apos;s more comfortable , but when David lines up , it &apos;s either wonderful or at the time when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that it only gives rise to this .
Now I had this connection with my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and gave me the TED Prize .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
In the past , my dream was to be at TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my joy and jokes , something else was happening in the brain that made decisions from a long time .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian map , and look at the Indian map , at the bottom 20,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house till we see Sarah , and feel great about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , a month later , the TED people decided to name the Koran .
I broke the web , and there was a picture of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) Lights controlled , and within seconds the system expected to be in denial . ( Laughter )
And remember being — he &apos;s afraid of the house — he leaves the tree !
And finally , finally , last minute , decision makers charged me and I can start working on conversations .
Now , the homeowner who tells the story of each type of task requires a scope of paper , how someone like me would give 2,000 weeks to someone like me and cannot write the same article at the beginning of the article , and then , incredibly successfully , an unbelievable piece of paper requires you to go and write the article overnight .
And the access to three cleanlines in this case — the system of the Sistine people .
That &apos;s great , so it &apos;s not easy for anyone to do it .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , it surprised me with the influence on it .
In fact , I received thousands of emails from around the world and from people , from different kinds of backgrounds .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , peters , and also massively transmitted CDs .
( Laughter ) And everybody was saying one thing and saying , &quot; I &apos;m absolutely confused by this piece . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the question of emails and the number of emails .
In the textbook of these people , the script was writing about how much SOLEs spent their life , about what they did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay ! If the system is right , what &apos;s the next ?
Why are they all in black ?
It turns out that there are two ways of seeing the list .
So today , for example , I gave them all data .
And when David lines up , recently , the effects of the recent earthquake are significant because of the household catch up .
But there &apos;s another kind of side to it , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data .
So if you want a project that starts itself like some kind of arts or businesses — some kind of arts or businesses , as long as you don &apos;t start to authenticate yourself , to keep the job done .
In addition to tasks , there are many other things that don &apos;t face debt online , such as accessing your family , exercise , understanding your health , understanding your relationships , telling your relationships that you &apos;re not hearing .
Now if the only way you can make a check-in is to have a check-in , it &apos;s very difficult , because all of those data points on the device are being lost in the home .
There &apos;s nothing you can do . The latest impact is you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And this kind of tweet is required to look at much , much less talked about , much less than just intellectual labor , a bit more profound .
You &apos;re suffering from horror and illness .
And it could be anti-seizure .
So I thought it was because of their email , and they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban recruitment made them look , sometimes in their own lives .
The trouble is not that he can &apos;t afford to pay for his dream , which is that he can &apos;t afford to cooperate .
I read all email , and one thing that came out — I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a particularly complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and some of you may have had good relationships with Dylan , but remember the phases when Dylan didn &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the life cylinder .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These are not so many bricks , especially when some of them are exposed .
I think we all need to be careful with this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in our business , because there &apos;s no time in every life .
We need to be careful with the generosity of compassion .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have that home , and maybe we should start doing it right now .
Maybe not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days in the U.S. and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan was moving from one area of Afghanistan to one area of Afghanistan , and they were moving from one area of Afghanistan to helping Afghanistan to provide a fund to protect the Afghan State Services so that Afghanistan could be used to protect a government office to protect an Afghan government from a foreign operation that was responsible
The military dictionary came in at the height of an attack , and they were surrounded by three , and with so many things , they looked at the hands of the Caspian Seventine as a child , and they saw the victims go out and save the dead .
A sergeant and he and a Spanish doctor were heading towards a helicopter , and he and a Spanish doctor were heading towards a helicopter .
It showed that Kepton Seventin and Iowa deserve this mysterious magic that bursts in the daytime .
They put them into helicopters , and then you see what happens when the Kepton Seventines burn and burn them first before they allowed others to rescue .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is it ? It &apos;s incredibly traumatic when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why I work with people , they don &apos;t .
You know , in the morning , people who want to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice other people so that we can benefit .
We &apos;ve got an email account !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they stay on the brakes .
These are the best people who aspire to the imagination of services , who are better people who aspire to the vision of services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , so each and every one of us has the capacity to work together and build on it so that we have the capacity to do this in others .
I have a brilliant privilege of getting to know some of these people today , and we will be told yesterday that I have the greatest privilege of getting to come with these people , and we will be told yesterday that they have given themselves and their knowledge to save others and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing : &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a huge sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The hard thing about the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not just humans .
It cannot be what you call &quot; &quot; surrender me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It can &apos;t be that I give the two people the chance to cooperate , and they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an excitement .
So where does this excitement come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago , at the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of threats , all of these strands are very focused on us .
There &apos;s no personal matter .
Dreadwinning may be a lack of resources , a long-term TEDster , but this is all working together to reduce the long-term trajectory of our lives , all together , and working together to reduce the longer term of our lives .
And so we were ready in the form of social animals , where we were together , and we got together and we did what I call a celebrity , like in a tribe where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , we were committed and we were committed to cooperation .
It has continuous benefits .
It means that I can sit and stare at night and stare at any of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , that means you don &apos;t look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by threats , things that are struggling to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
This economy can move beyond market conditions .
It could be a new technology that pulls your business apart in one night and it could be a new technology that can lead your business cracks in one night .
Or you can have a fight that sometimes tries to fight you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it drives up your risks and your businesses are trying to get you out of business , it drives up your risks and your businesses are trying to get you out of business .
We don &apos;t have any authority on these authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never be done .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s the place where the mathematics is done , because that &apos;s the belief that governs the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and the lives of the people in her organization who are contributing to protecting the people and the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to assess their peace and loyalty results so that people can experience their peace and loyalty results so that people can feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , they can
I was touring a neighborhood trip , and I realized that when a passenger attempted to knock on the door and I saw the workers at the door who were coming to me just like he passed the law as he was crying .
One of the first times I tried to walk on it was the first time I could climb on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep washing machines like these ?
Why can &apos;t you walk the dog like us ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we love the way we travel to the West Virginia is not because they &apos;re keeping people tuned for the better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are right , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and as a result , less organization .
What is a great leader for her , and I can show you the most close example of how to be a good parent is the best example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent looks like , what would you like ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our children the opportunities , education , structure and record , when it is necessary , we want to give our children the opportunities , education , structure and record , when it is necessary , we want to give them the tools to grow and get more out of what we can do for ourselves , to raise them and have more of what we can do for ourselves .
Great leaders want that .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s necessary , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , discipline , discipline , when it &apos;s necessary , they want to give them the chance to create self-confidence , they want to have time and failure so that they can make more of the things we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can make more of the things we &apos;ve never imagined .
Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City , Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , and they said one thing : If you have a hard time in your family , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie removed the practical lack of forced labor , Charlie removed the practical lack of forced labor .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get to work on the basis of effective problems .
Instead , if you have a problem , they &apos;ll mentor you and help you , in the same way that we would do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and so outraged , some residents at CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and so outraged , some residents at the CEO , and that &apos;s because so many people are so frustrated and so outraged , some residents at the top , some of whom are so outraged and so outraged .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the fundamental laws of gravity .
They have grown a dense society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their own well-being kids the experience of their well-being , we know that they &apos;ve given their well-being to people for their well-being , but they tell them that they have sacrificed their well-being because of their well-being , but that they have convinced their well-being of their well-being .
It &apos;s something that compares to us , not data .
Can anyone guess why they give the giant a 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t teachers get 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problem with that ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
They &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people rapid data to save .
At Budapest Chepman Media , they run a mining company in the Budapest Media , and they run a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 that became the winner of the assembly line , and they spent 30 percent of their time carrying around their kids .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their property more .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , so many of the companies that today have accumulated the board people and did the right thing .
And Bob answered that .
You &apos;ll notice that the bubble gum doesn &apos;t trust .
It &apos;s more difficult to lower your blood flow , and it &apos;s more difficult to lower your blood flow .
And then they built a dedicated plan .
That every single employee , every single one of them , would have to go to the CEO in a four-week leave .
They could never do that when they wanted it and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But just as Bob mentioned the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said that it &apos;s better for all of us to suffer little pains instead of some of us taking much more money and getting more aggression .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel protected from the wealth of an organization , trust and cooperation happen automatically .
And just as nobody expected , people began to trade each other .
The ones that were most successful were making small business with the kids .
That means something that took five weeks to get everyone to just three weeks .
Gravity is an extreme , not a reward .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizations &apos; leadership skills , I know a lot of people who are very good at organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs and we do what they say because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of an organization who have no authority , and they are real leaders , and it &apos;s because they have the privilege to see the person on the left , and it &apos;s because they have chosen to see the person on the left , and they have the privilege to see the person on the right , and they have the right to see the person .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the foreign figures that had been out in the cafeteria , and the way the scientist works is that he eats honey and he feeds his men first , and when he dies , he doesn &apos;t save anything for him .
And when he came back into the field , his men gave him some food from his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them they do it .
We call them leaders because they take risks from the first place , we call them leaders because they take risks from the first place .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe and that people can benefit them , and when we do so , natural responsibility is that people want to give us the victims .
They &apos;ll give us their own blood and blood and blood so they can see their dream becomes real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your tissue to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to do this ?
And aren &apos;t those organizations that we all want to work for ? And aren &apos;t the organizations that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little bit of the story of &quot; &quot; The Limpopo , &quot; &quot; which is true of Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the water supply and the water supply is incredibly traumatic , and in these circumstances , it &apos;s very hard to grow up once at the age of 17 , I was staying quiet in the bush with friends in the bush .
The sun is getting warmer in summer .
And as I was working in the bush , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you create something that just squeezes on your skin and doesn &apos;t have to do it ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I need to buy it . &quot; &quot; And I went home and I did some research and I found some surprising data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four out of them are in Africa , and there are only four in South Africa .
Different diseases contain the environment in which the most dangerous chromosome is known as the most dangerous .
One of the things that happens when you have a chromosome in your eye is you can mentally blow up by one of the more severe ones .
This disease consistently inspires millions of people every year , and most importantly , it &apos;s the only thing you have to solve for your trachoma : no pants , no gas , no engineering .
After I looked at the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it , but I &apos;m doing it for at least because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I took one of my top 6234 mobile phones out of my laptop — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a broadband network , I went to Google , and I
And I looked at this as a kind of peculiar problem .
So what we said was right , our formulas were ready .
Now we need to process this .
Four years later , after I wrote my patent on a 40-page business plan on the phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent owner in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; Nonsense ! &quot; &quot; ) — I couldn &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mystery exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need butter .
( Laughter ) So after trying to make it work in high school and end-of-life resources , which I had , the mentor university enterprised a few new people , did it , and now we have a full-scale model that &apos;s ready to go into the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products much .
They &apos;re just selling under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of shrimp . They &apos;re selling a shrimp every day because it &apos;s more expensive .
So we put DryBath in these creative milestones .
You just push it in between and leave it outside .
And the cool thing is , a normal one is exposed to just five corners .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about the waste of products .
We even want DryBath to be able to get there — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave and we could save two houses for children who live in the remote areas , two houses , more houses for school , two more houses for more houses , two more houses for the kid .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken out our key values of value , health and service .
DryBath is the service of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
The process takes place , now we &apos;re in the process of selling it to a multinational brand that can be shipped to the retail market , and one question for my listeners today : Clean Limpopo , with 50 ranks per week equivalent to a method that doesn &apos;t have to dominate the world .
Are you crying ? ( Applause ) I &apos;ve not done anything yet , I haven &apos;t done anything yet .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I learned so much during that time , last year Google announced me to be the world &apos;s oldest teenager .
I &apos;m also the world &apos;s greatest entrepreneur right now , the first African that &apos;s edited , and one of the things that surprised me , which is why all of this was not to regret . Thank you .
( Applause )
However , I &apos;m here today to share some of the results that I discovered and to myself , wonder what are the main reasons why organizations are successful — which are really due to the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find the human potential that was once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why do most of them fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , drawing a lot of my misconceptions and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations in the last few years .
I wanted to know this because I was building various shops from the age of 12 , January Heather , from kindergarten to kindergarten , to school , when I was making solar , then I was in college , when I was making radio .
I graduated from college , and I started a founder of a software company .
And 20 years ago , the ideology started , in the last 20 years , we have made hundreds of accidents , and very big accidents .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to give theorists the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think there &apos;s something .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; The Idiot Lives , &quot; &quot; the very last moment you feel about it .
Throughout that time , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to maintain or maintain , is more important than I think .
I had never thought that this was going to be a TEDster , but once he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s a plan , until I have a plan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team has the ability to recruit from cooking is critical .
Each car is an honest reality .
So I thought perhaps the most important team had .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have an explicit policy about income ?
With him , it seemed to me that what matters most to success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies make a big investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
After that , of course — is it time ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t ready for it ?
It &apos;s fast , so you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or is it too late , and before there &apos;s so much aggression ?
So I applied a lot of respect to these five factors in many institutions .
And the idea was to have 100 companies in Libya , and 100 others out there trying to find some scientific results .
So first of all , these are the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of commerce .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — were very hopeful for us , but it wasn &apos;t successful .
And then I tried to incorporate all of these identities , as I think these companies had moved forward .
Then in the outsiders of Libya , I saw strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and Linkeddin .
A few failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a big investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out , but the highest impact of all these companies was the success and the failure , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was time .
Right now , 42 percent of the time is spent on success and miscarriage .
The team and the team &apos;s perspective on the other end , and then they think , being different , having a different mindset , that &apos;s actually number three .
But it &apos;s actually not true , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was amazed that the idea didn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my mind .
I think the market model has gotten worse , because you can start a business model without a market model , and then you can add the product to the city .
And investment , if initially low investment , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples of all of these notes .
Take the big success of Airbnb , as everyone knows .
It &apos;s very popular that a lot of investors noticed because people thought , who &apos;s going to put some of their homes on the line ?
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons why grassroots is the best market model , the idea , and the market mechanism is falling at the right time .
This company came in front of a factory of financial difficulties when people needed additional support , and it surely helped people respond to the proposals that they made at home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinkers .
However , time was exactly right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders were aspiring extra money ; it was absolutely essential .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a toilet .
Goto.com , which we announced in 1998 here at TED , was a time when businesses were trying to become more disclosed .
We thought it was the best , but in fact , the right time was probably the most important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so excited about this — working with some great guys and some great business models , to work with some of the great guys at the Hole in the Wall .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broadband was very , very small .
It was so hard to watch the online video , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and finally this company reached its end in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of the code , and more than 50 percent of broadband in America , YouTube was the best one .
Great idea , the best of times .
As it turns out , YouTube had no commercial model of it .
They didn &apos;t even believe it was going to happen .
But he was the absolute best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception really matters .
Idea is critical .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they &apos;re really hungry for your spouse .
And certainly the trustworthiness is , the outcome is not from the outcome , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but in the time frame , you have to work very , very easily .
As it used to be , primary organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
I hope some of those conversations will help clarify your success , and then that &apos;s not the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; On April 3 , 2016 , we saw the greatest data point in history . &#93; &#91; Fifth accent was written to rich and powerful people . &#93; &#91; A lot of money has been leaked in non-market societies . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve sent the Rabbit of Ventures to Discover the Rabbit Monterey . &#93; &#91; Fifth accent to the Rabbit
Fifth of all those papers were stated by secret weapons companies .
We have the inner stories of villages , banks and villages , who come in with fashion magazines and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can see the exchange of messages , you can see the way it &apos;s done , how it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s starting to show up .
The Ministry of Finland is a notebook .
We also learned that there are smart Alaska factories sitting behind barbed walls .
The revenue from his two-billion-dollar paycheck goes to his homeowner &apos;s master bedroom through his childhood friend , the celebrity bedroom .
And many , many rich people will be infected , and the ones that tell the story , they will be at home with more hidden documents .
Now , this seems like a magic trick , or a John Goddess &apos; novel , for me .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that aggression and power stay in place and the way they shouldn &apos;t be taxed , which means that effective improvements like teachers get less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , Global Witness , this is amazing .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people in shell companies handle their impacts that we &apos;re discovering with our opinions .
I think for people , it &apos;s a cool world to give , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like little girls .
You can log in to another company , another company inside , which is pretty much impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind this thing .
For legislative mischief , press , school districts , it &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s going on .
I think that &apos;s particularly interesting in the United States .
Maybe it &apos;s because the celebrities don &apos;t have to be in this audience .
Now , this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
It &apos;s due to fashion companies , only a few in the U.S. Foundation .
I think if we look at the findings of Kim Illind or Delhi Winter or the Wall Street or the New York Times , it &apos;s the kind of thing that connects Americans .
Instead , many American citizens don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give them less information in order to run a company than at the Liber Report Card .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
It allows nine supermarket investments to be easy .
This kind of behavior affects all of us .
Now in Gallup Ventures , we wanted to see what his problem was .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did is we actually switched a campaign to run 13 intelligence companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transport the village across America to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
What was really striking was that all of the villages could give a single demonstration of how the heart could move .
These were all early meetings , and we had no budget , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but we had a dropout rate .
But also , it &apos;s important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual law that talked about our wedding and our proposals .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , protecting touch , cleaning , dignity and unemployment .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game in order to have difficulty in that way .
It can be ridiculous , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , as rich and powerful people always are .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This problem was solved on the political spectrum , but the British Prime Minister David Cameraman stood at 8 o &apos;clock in the southern hemisphere in 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been forming a central record of the global climate , whether or not there are companies in Europe that are controlling them .
The evidence is that HIV is behind it .
The contrast between the landscape of representative law in the center and the center , which we didn &apos;t want to go up very much , so we turned five .
We want to see the inventions , the larger sections of small companies , used around the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Galapagos Venture .
We need to get to the point of despair in the people who are familiar behind barbed wires .
Have a voice , have a voice , and it &apos;s not good for legacy , it &apos;s us .
Politicians need politicians to address this issue , and vote for the legal changes to access information .
We can bring together this facility to unlock the secrets that are responsible for the cutting and the calling .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lexus , who invented you , has had a much better sense of documents in the last few years than any other media in the world .
Can it be true ?
Julie Song : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a puzzle — isn &apos;t it ? — that all over the world , media is showing a very poor performance that a small group of workers are capable of communicating information that is far more than all the other media in the world .
CA : What is that like ?
How do people make false papers ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julie Song : Yes , there are — I can say this — public services in the right way . And we have so many ways that they can get the information to us .
That &apos;s why we use a lot of high-speed storage to extract materials from one place on the Internet , to extract characteristics from legal contractors like Sweden and Bill .
We get the information from data , from ordinary DDC , from Ramadan , or whatever , commenting as a regular news organization , fostering — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about broader information for the public , and then protecting yourself against the illegal and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you actually never know what the scale is .
Julian Sangzing : That &apos;s right , here we &apos;ve all learned how to do it , and if we get to a point , we quickly extract information from the skin .
( Clapping ) God gossiped .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think they &apos;re kind of coming up here and asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can see it at the top .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julie Sung : Yes , so this is a report .
It was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the elections in 2004 .
Before 2004 , there was the government of Daniel Arppi , 18 years ago .
She was a solid alcohol in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the box — because of the apparent powers that they were trying to decipher from Kenya , they spent 20 million pounds of this report fee , this report , and one more report .
And then the government was sitting at it and using it to counter their political benefits , which was the wealthiest man — now the wealthiest person in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ in Kenya .
That &apos;s why it was made in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish it from the very first election in December 2008 .
When we took that report , three days later , we decided to volunteer for the new president , Kubai decided to volunteer with the person who was horrified by Daniel Arabha , so this report was hung and stuck in the corner of the capital .
Chris Anderson : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s just — it &apos;s just spread in Kenya , not from the censorship , but from the mean , and from your perspective , it changed the result .
Julin Sung : Yes . This is the headlines in Guardian , and then it spread across all over Kenya , in the Thailand and South Africa newspapers .
So it came in from the outside .
And he , a few days later , gave the Nigerian press relief to him that he could talk about it .
And it was on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the country &apos;s ratio 10 percent , according to one online sex report , and it changed the game .
CA : Wow , so how did your secret experience change the world ?
BG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re just showing a little bit of a left-hand video of the device .
It &apos;s a long video , but there &apos;s a little bit of a clip there .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-definition video .
RG : ... It &apos;s tough , when you first brave them .
I thought , oh , there are four things with them .
It &apos;s clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me . Go figure it out .
Hello everyone .
Glass , clap !
( Machine noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Machine noises ) Galen is running .
Hatel — two great master &apos;s , two great master &apos;s .
We need to move now , time is up !
Okay , we killed eight people .
Here we see two old Hilly Kepler , and we &apos;re still running gas .
RG : They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God beat you , Hello . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julie Sang : People who did this work had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people excited about this .
These were the first of three times that happened .
CA : So 11 people in this situation , right ? Two responders ?
Julie Sung : Yes ! Two employees in the lab , two small children were infected .
Generally 18 to 26 people died .
Chris Anderson : And he suffered a great deal .
What was the main reason for the poor , you think ?
Julian Sangzing : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as a very , very unequal force .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the street , and then one kilometer away , the alpha helicopter begins to scratch the surface of the 30 kilometers of helicopter , each one of them — by any means — and also lets the parent stop .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t any kind of paper , because they were conscious .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. State Department , Brad Mining got arrested , and it said that he had acknowledged that video that he presented to you about 280,000 and a half American documentaries as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Song : So we decided to take the documents .
The conclusion was made just five days ago , that 150,000 documents were made and 50 .
But what we have done now is we have documented in Rwanda and an American safety home in the beginning of the year , but there &apos;s no correlation between them .
I mean , I used to come to this safari room .
CA : I mean , if you gave thousands of hands to the American auction .
Julie Song : We &apos;re giving them what we want . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do ? ) June Sung : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) June Sung : Because things like this show that in fact , what the Arab government is doing is actually violating human rights in these governments .
If you look at hidden documents like this , it &apos;s in them .
CA : Please stand up and talk about it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why should you open up blind data ?
Julian Sung : So the question is how important information in the world is , what information can be made possible .
And there &apos;s so much information .
They spend a critical amount of money on trying to keep an organization secure , and it &apos;s a good suggestion that when you need to get information out , you hope to do something good , because what organizations know better , and they know about them , they also care about how to read it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of innovation .
CA : But are there any risks for a more collective or a more collective society , where innovation doesn &apos;t exist ?
Julie Sang : We didn &apos;t make false papers with them .
I mean , our big task is task .
By using information , we can extract information in a very specific way that &apos;s very personalized — the information that &apos;s available to someone who &apos;s presenting .
But there &apos;s also some mystery — like your doctor has your knowledge ; it &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about civic goods coming in and being fresh .
CA : Okay , so they &apos;re passionately doing it .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , someone whose daughter &apos;s daughter is in the United States Senate , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people like to inspire other people .
One of the most famous scientists in America shows people dying .
What this does is — but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you saying ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Sung : Well , we &apos;ve been asking so many questions like this .
But remember in the abdomen , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what their behavior is , it doesn &apos;t matter what their behavior is .
Because they all see something every day .
It &apos;s going to change their mind and mindset that gives money to all of this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you &apos;re looking forward to what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to see these light bulbs , that you should be keeping yourself warm in the same way that you do ?
Julie Song : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not in any different cell .
We don &apos;t have the information that is abused by other minds .
If they do that , that &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that it &apos;s going to grow tomorrow .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , what we &apos;ve done , what we &apos;ve heard — is we &apos;ve brought the visibility out there .
You can also imagine that there will be different kinds of breakthroughs about the lions and the lions .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or you could have a problem .
What is the view of Jerusalem ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Sung : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : These are really great people , geeks , really good .
We &apos;ll have to try and do it . Let me show you another example .
Here &apos;s something you &apos;ve never done before , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is a little old , right ?
What is it ?
Julie Song : This is a sample of what we do nearly every day .
Last year alone — in November , a bunch of important pieces were put together in bananas , like the cells were in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report — which was a very good experiment about it — which was that , in fact , conservation companies had fighted different oil companies and they stuck there and they went .
And there were some former military governments , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing on that report . That &apos;s why we had a very difficult time .
We can &apos;t predict it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we wondered , maybe this company did all kinds of competition .
So we put it up there , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and I look it up , but we can &apos;t make sense of it . &quot; &quot; So we had a letter that was written on the exact same week that she wanted to wear the paper . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to weigh the paper . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , let &apos;s talk about it .
What documents are you talking about ?
Can you show how much money you actually have on it ?
Does it really happen to you ? &quot; &quot; So they shipped what we see on Scripture with the name of the text , the microwave DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This happens many times .
This is our way of thinking and thinking about what materials are , and it &apos;s trying to write and get the letter from these people .
CA : All right . So how many of you have any information from inside the Bible ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re putting together a bunch of iterative breakthroughs like this one .
This is why our announcement , in the past several months , has become somewhat more successful because we are improving our budget system because of the extraordinary public waste that we have .
It &apos;s friction .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s playing , more than our own capabilities depend on us because of our increasing growth , and that means that we have public services in the population that are highly intelligent but we don &apos;t have people who can process this information and predict it .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , with the desire of a journalist or a journalist ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the materials that we need to integrate , so we need to reclaim those people that have a lot of empathy with the materials of public safety , and then a little bit of empathy with the subject matter .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julie Sung : Yes , my parents were in the movie business , and then moving away from the city , so the two reasons were influenced .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so what you &apos;re saying is that everything can be done can be accomplished just by artificial intelligence .
Julie Sang : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one hero at a young age , and you came up with this idea of working very quickly .
Julie Sung : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist working at a young age .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time when the crime was happening to me .
To do that , you need to appreciate the word .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that you can use different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only used by Russian mafia to sponsor your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not the same as the word before .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that your grandmother is a banker , but do you think of your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some event in their lives that has helped them deal with it ?
Julie Sung : I don &apos;t believe in facts .
But the basic value : good , affordable and evil people do not produce enemies ; they grow up .
And that &apos;s the point that I learned from my father and some other brave and healthy people that I &apos;m living in .
CA : And brilliant , healthy people don &apos;t want to be born the enemy ?
Julian Sangzing : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m an old man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of growing a chicken , which is approaching the police with crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s been in my career for so long .
Chris Anderson : So we had to just say , for the last time , what happened in the last year ?
Basically , you published something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you put the paper out there that sparked the controversy about your storytelling .
Instead , they showed you the opportunity .
So you &apos;ve been very popular in the U.S. , and what happened ?
Julie Song : Yes , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
AIDS has been a crisis .
There she was .
The bankers here had gone up 10 percent of the country &apos;s GDP .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the profound resistance of the establishment five minutes before it was released , as a movie : &quot; &quot; Unviolent resistance on the screen , &quot; &quot; and the state of the New Reader was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed up the website , time-consuming all the time , and we became very popular in the U.S. , and I went to Ice Land talked about this issue .
And the issues that were there that shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the scientists at NASA Lawrence , worked with some other international experts , we proposed a new kind of Asian London law called it a kind of Freedom Media , the most protective place for journalists all over the world , the new Nepal prince to bring freedom .
A nation of the North Atlantic right whale is like a nation , which is heading up from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Alliance Party appointed this properly .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look at the future , did you realize that the most expected thing to do is to show power and power , or to see greater security , or to see all of us expected power , or to do this most ?
Julie Song : I can &apos;t believe where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure in order to suit the law of free demand and and the law of transparency , all over the world — between Europe , China and the U.S.
What is it going to be ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So it &apos;s a really interesting time to live — because with a little effort , we can move it side to side .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience here into what they call the Jews , with respect , and all the power to you .
Julie Sang : Thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did that , which is milk waste .
I was walking through the halls of my childhood Connecticut , and I saw these chains peering through the halls .
When I got older and got home in the early 1990s , I got this email .
My team stayed quiet .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , I suddenly realized , how do the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the last several months that I &apos;ve ever been amazed about , you know , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or in London , I &apos;ve been looking at four species of beings popping up on the ice — cold , silence and code .
And I thought that was kind of peculiar , and I was surprised to see if anyone else ever had a copy of that conductive model .
And when I took that leave , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at these quadriplegic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Natural world constraints a few elements , and there &apos;s no unusual human traits .
We did this work 10,000 years ago when we separated ourselves from our closets .
If you look at the light from around 10,000 years ago , they &apos;ll look at rocks and branches , and you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look at the previous 2,000 years ago , all you would see are four animals : cars , trains , squids .
It &apos;s also true of our ancestors .
If you look at the mines of the New York City about 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see cartoons , sticks and flowers .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of maggots , coal , but also manure .
It understands that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Cheers .
This is a brand new problem .
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been doing the same thing .
World War II gave us the greatest inspiration to become a warmer .
During the great war , we developed technologies like snowflakes , hydrogen polymers , and so on , the whole thing collapsed .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have come to see the greatest increase in the capacity of catastrophe .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soap opera and the sea urchins have increased , and within a couple of years , their income has increased greater than cumulative emissions .
Now if you collect the fishing and the battlefield , it will be equal to two Chinese births per year from the sea .
My favorite example of using Chinese Catholic is not the case , because China is not just one of the largest migrants , but also the largest embassy .
So let &apos;s move now to our four choices .
The first one is the most utilized sea food in the U.S. and the West .
Warfare is an incredibly bad thing .
Only one pound of forest is used to kill five , 10 , or 15 pounds of foreign fights to get to market .
Language is an unbelievable way to go to market .
In a study done at the University of Delhi , it showed that gasoline sequesters are particularly effective at exploiting hydrogen sulfide .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That whose battlefields contain reservoirs is the manager battle .
Now look at these magnificent girls .
These Earth drops the footprint of its place , protecting the beaches , the wildlife and the hills , and all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the civil war in Managua .
We &apos;ve lost hundreds of thousands of coal miners in the last 30 or 40 years .
A second procedure which is here , which is what the philosopher Marine Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve just looked at the Trojan River , and it &apos;s very controversial .
There are several things that are already starting to do , that leather is running out of the back of the net , but with it , with so many other leatherbacks , she picks up other leatherbacks and turns them into food after leather .
And many times it takes a toll on the goods that are named &quot; &quot; raw . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the one that we like to look at on the river and convert it into food , which means that the ecosystem , the ecosystem , is eating itself and growing .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You need to take a look at areas that are very large to organize .
We also have a zone in which scientists call the Enterprise Facit Management , or the ICCAT — the Enterprise Facilitator to Protect the Internet .
Carl whale has been a great advocate of all kinds of experiments .
We can take the ranks of Taiwan , but it &apos;s not good for Taiwan .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tattoos get heated .
He heats up to 40 miles an hour , and his body heats up to 20 degrees C.
The entire fund of the treatment is closed .
A blood vessel supply is a blood vessel that doesn &apos;t last very long .
This is the best for protein .
But the forest creatures , 40 miles away , are not capable of staying in the forest .
Sami has been a good luck . It doesn &apos;t have to be a bad month .
This is my political contact .
Connecticut was breaking down .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a document .
There are 3,000 more drugs in the state of Connecticut .
In fact , I say that most people are connected — ( Laughter ) if anyone solves the power of contact , I think we can make the world a lot better .
And everywhere , ladies and gentlemen , these are the rockets that are propelled by the mosquitos to give the children .
As a result , we have a success story on the front lines and the front lines .
When the shaming begins , the shaming process used six pounds to build a shaming platform .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
There &apos;s another one in common that &apos;s a little bit false , because if you look at the footage of Florence , they name the keyboard in a football game .
Whereas the footprint is very happy .
As people say , leather dollars and leatherback office is hard to say .
But then again , the credit card industry required that he undertook the reputation of the pound shelter .
This is a system that produces cooking , which is gasoline wasted .
This goes back seven percent per year .
Although we &apos;re spending a little bit less money on getting to market , but we &apos;re also spending a lot of money .
We don &apos;t just keep eating milk ; we keep eating milk and eggs .
We have what &apos;s left and what &apos;s left .
Because on top of it , the blood and hands and so forth add bullets .
I wonder what the hell she has , but she has exhausted the veil .
It &apos;s about India or starvation . ( Laughter ) And as a result , it &apos;s a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been shuttled out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third part of China or the half of America that &apos;s getting out of the sea every year .
That &apos;s the last thing in four sentences .
Philadelphia actually started as a lifetime .
And it started with a local manufacturer who saw that the next day , no one would ever be on the Mike Dodds .
He grabbed his hand and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make eye contact for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
What &apos;s more of the syndrome going to be considered sacred to the sea is evidence that it &apos;s not harmless but harmless .
So he created his lift song .
Unfortunately , the pendulum came in 30 seconds .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter cylinder , so he scaled the Atlantic Code .
The USDA allows the United States of Philadelphia to produce the largest mass-industrial art industry in the United States , 20 to 3 billion pounds a year from the sea .
If we end the policies , the future choice may be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It turns plastic proteins into highly active animal proteins , and that &apos;s what I call the third world .
Actually , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; it grows from one individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a refrigerator .
It has no ACE and DDI whatsoever that we think will live forever .
So what do we do next ?
I mean , this poor Michelangelo clip .
That &apos;s a large sample of about three million tons .
One possibility of a conservative environment is that we can eat it ?
Can we find a way to give it to people instead of giving them a chance ?
There are reasons for that .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace where the average elite on poverty is a common proportion , and the most effective elite on the Amazon period .
This is amongst the top three , the EPA and the DNA .
So this is her potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few dollars a pound or a few pounds , and turned it into a football game , we hired the leather tract and we asked the goods to pay the goods to pay the goods again ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is homework assignments .
They have much more EPAs and DNA .
The Indus calculations are particularly effective .
Cookie fisheries contain only three quarters of what we feed them to the market .
Actually , it comes out of the ground about three hours .
The Pacific Ocean is made up of three vertices , so they just collect them .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
Our Western box has been shaped by fashion and neurojournalism .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 dead people have been born , and that &apos;s why the ocean &apos;s life has died .
And as you can think about Kallikuppam , in all these different circles , there are more than three protons and more objects that are very effective .
It &apos;s very practical .
And the last one is a symbol of a question .
We can produce a material that can provide the benefits of ocean protein .
It needs to be a green flute , it needs to grow fast and changing environments in its own right , and it needs to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Getty East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for 15 years .
Whenever I talk about it , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it all .
But try not to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is going to be in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all just happening .
We want to think without our demands .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a little bit crazy .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I had a big brain to read , because I have a brother who is a neurological condition called schizophrenia .
As a young man and later , I wanted to understand , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and create my dreams ?
What happens to my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia is that they don &apos;t integrate their dreams into a common reality and they act on it .
So I &apos;ve spent my life studying severe mental illness .
And I moved from my father &apos;s project to Boston , where I worked at the President Francis Bank , who was a professor at Harvard University .
So what was the answer to the mathematical level ? What was the difference between people &apos;s brains , who generally imagine orders , versus people &apos;s brains in Scottish , versus people &apos;s brains , with schizophrenia or epilepsy , are we actually trying to create a map of the microscopic spectrum of the brain , whose cell sends the messages of the cell with the chemical and how much
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this sort of research on the day , but on Friday and weekend , I was going to National Elvis on a pilot trip to the NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intelligent D.C.
The left part of my brain was a nine strokes .
And for the next four minutes , I watched my brain become completely disconnected by any ability to understand information .
I was able to read and remember something in the morning of college .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you &apos;ve ever looked at the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the upper part of the brain , the front-end part of the brain , of a stroke that &apos;s touched on the back of my brain , and it &apos;s going to stay in my mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think about computers , on the right part of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , where the left part of our brain operates like a solar processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through a collective culture that acts like 300 volunteers .
But they &apos;re also identical to each other .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing each part of the brain has a completely different understanding of the information , their minds are different things , and you let me just let you know who their identities are very different from each other .
Compassion — thank you . Compassion .
Audience : Yes , it &apos;s a big deal .
( Laughter ) Our brain &apos;s evidence is just a fraction of the time and we think about this moment .
Right now , we &apos;re thinking about images of our brain , and it &apos;s organically thought of by the movements of our bodies .
Information is stored and stored in our bodies by our whole system of neuroscience , and then it &apos;s rested and evolved into a giant almond-shaped classroom that tells us what exists in the current state of mind and what it feels like to feel and what it feels like to hear .
I &apos;m an energy moving away from the energy surrounding me from the right-hand cortex of the brain .
We &apos;re using energy from each other , from the right part of the brain , to the right part of the brain , as a human family .
And at this time , we are brothers and sisters on this planet whose skill is to make the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The left part of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that we take our current great album / Class , and we begin to collect and then collect these storytellers .
And it also informs this combination and this integration of information that comes from all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely the impacts of our plans .
The left-hand part of our brain is thinking of language .
It &apos;s a conversation that continues to connect us and our inner world to the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me how to go home and buy one .
I &apos;ll have to have them in the morning , and it &apos;s my confession to read a book that reminds me where to read .
But perhaps the most important voice is what he says : I ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become isolated .
I become the only person in the world with the advanced power around me and with you .
And that part of my brain experienced first-class this morning .
On the morning of the assault , my left eye slammed with broken pain .
It was as painful as it was to take a bite of the air .
And that pain just dragged me around and left .
And he leaves , he leaves .
It was extraordinary to me that I had never experienced any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went off and I put on my shelves and I put on my cardboard scanner , which is a physical exercise machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it feels like my hand is the fate of the original person who ordered Donna .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a bizarre thing . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the way I think has changed my mind , which is really the general sense that I &apos;m a human being , which is coming out of the machine , but now I was in a very humble and mysterious place where my mind was
And it was all very strange and poor , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started screaming in the room , and I felt like everything was going on inside my body .
And everybody &apos;s got a very difficult and thought .
I don &apos;t have a connection with my speed , and I think there &apos;s a housing problem , so I just have to focus on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my bedroom ready to underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a sound that was saying , and my background has to stop you .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balanced , so I &apos;m just pushing the wall .
I &apos;m walking around looking at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t recover the damage of my body right now .
I couldn &apos;t understand where I started and where I stopped , because my hand was held up by atoms and magnetic walls with magnetic walls and magnetic walls .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; At that moment , the speech on the left of my brain got so quiet .
It &apos;s like someone was speaking the sound of the TV set on Ramadan .
A breakthrough .
One of the first things that surprised me was the amount of damage inside my brain .
But then immediately , there was this huge amount of energy in the loop of this huge space around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was really beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came to my brain and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a lesbian . &quot;
So we needed some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I &apos;m really afraid of the problem , but I immediately came back to the same kind of consciousness that I would say for a long time .
But it was such a beautiful place .
Look how beautiful it will be where you &apos;re completely connected from this tiny brain that is surrounding you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this vessel where my kidney and I &apos;m getting stressed out about it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And measure all of your relationships from the outside world , and the depression has been lost .
And I felt a sense of purpose .
And guess what it would be like to leave behind this 70-year-old emotional burden that you have left behind .
( Laughter ) Oh , I started as a sculptor , an activist .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain got involved , and he said , hey , it &apos;s two .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , I need help . I need my soul . &quot; &quot; So I walked out of the closet , and I walked into my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I move my car ? &quot; &quot; And that moment my hand was completely disconnected .
I was reminded at that time that my God was attacking me , the other thing that my mind tells me is how awesome it is !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
Who are the brain researchers who will come to realize this opportunity , that they can consciously see their own brain and that can go inside — ( Laughter ) — and then came to my brain one day . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very popular woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go into a college . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; All right , I can &apos;t stop the fighting in college , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I need to get on the phone to help me get a call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job . Then I remember I had my budget tickets on my phone .
So I go into my studio and I open up a three-inch card .
And I look up at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eye what my bookshelves look like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card I don &apos;t think , because I don &apos;t want to see any of the cords .
And the definition of words would be helpful by the character of the word &quot; &quot; paper &quot; &quot; and the character stamps , and I didn &apos;t know anything .
I then began to wait for what I call the description .
And at that moment , the normal truth was repeated , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card ; it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to reduce that slide by one inch .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effect of the pollution was on the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number . I don &apos;t want to understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in there .
I took the banks and I put them here , and now I &apos;m looking at the cards , and I &apos;m seeing all the little barbs look like the phone .
But then I switch off to my beloved length when I came back , I couldn &apos;t remember putting that number back in .
So I took my fucking arm like a giant and stuck it on the sidewalk , and I immediately reached out to these girls and said , &quot; &quot; When I come back to the normal truth , let me tell you that I had just arrived in India and finally arrived in all of India , and I learned that the guy on the phone runs on the cockpit , a guy called me up and said , &quot;
So I say to him , very clearly in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking to you . I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; wow . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m talking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then he came to me that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and I didn &apos;t understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped me .
And then a little while later , in an ambulance , Sierra Leone was rushing to the hospital from one hospital to Boston .
I walked up and looked like a child with a small leg .
Just like the one in which the rest of the herd was just going out of the closet , I pulled out the energy and I felt the pressure of my soul .
And it occurred to me that now I &apos;m not allowed to live my life .
Or , the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or a second time of my transport .
By the time I left , I was surprised to learn that I still lived .
When I felt really in touch with my soul , I gave life a word to God .
Now my brain was stroking apart , the opposite of fact .
At the time , the emotion from my sensory system began to develop , which was only through pain .
Lightning lit my brain like a fire in the forest , and the lights were so close and so bright that I could not understand a voice , or I would not understand a voice , and I would only track the fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t understand my body posture , so I felt enormous and wide , like someone who had just gotten rid of my beloved .
And my spirit was unleashed like a giant wallet sitting in the ocean of silence .
Great neuron .
I got the quality that matters .
And I remembered thinking that it would never be possible that I could find my own wonderful existence and access to a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been taken by neurons .
And if I &apos;m married to neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is , that neurons can be acquired , and I &apos;ve seen the world associated with lovely , fresh , comfortable and loving people who know that they can ever feel this quality .
And they can pick up living and choose the right to which books are going to take their way to the left side of their brain and search for this pure quality .
And then I realized how powerful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of versions that taught me how to live my life .
And he gave me his medical attention .
Shortly after the stroke of my jaw , he bleeded a blood vessel from my brain that was trapping the restorative power center of my brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real fate in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of quantum life , artificial skills and two extremely good brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can stand at the right side of my consciousness where we are .
I am the powerful force of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful cellular ular ular ular ular ular ular ular matrix contained in one form , one in which everybody exists .
Or I can choose to step back to the left of my consciousness where I become one individual in a trivial manner .
Quantum fluctuations .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
What would you choose ?
What would you choose ?
And where ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain holding electricity to the right brain , the more we put peace in this world and the planet will be so safe .
And I thought , you know , we need to reframe that .
Thank you .

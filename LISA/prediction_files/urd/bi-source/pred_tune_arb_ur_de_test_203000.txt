Good morning !
You guys are gone ?
They picked up my name for Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Tiger in Arabic ?
No ! No ? Well , no problem .
Once upon a time , as a young boy , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was forced to eat .
So I asked myself , do you have the desire to eat in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Fetch free , Muslim . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; meen , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meen . &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , deal with this problem ! &quot; &quot; he said .
He was talking to me with three people , as he was telling himself , &quot; If this were the last girl in the world , I wouldn &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A boy who wrote two words made exactly the same decision for a girl . Where .
How can they talk like this ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What gives me the right to speak my own country ?
Where does this happen ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , there are many people like me , who come to this stage in their lives where , inherently , they discard everything that &apos;s in their minds , just because they love to be able to say , and they need to be religious .
Should I be bringing all of my culture , my ideas , my spirit and my spirit ?
We may have the most important battle savings in the children &apos;s stories .
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
Why does it matter ?
In spite of all this , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision about the spirit as what it was for me .
The Arabic language does not ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or research , or language that we use in uniforms , the language that we use in the workplace , the language that we rely on when we work on the blueprints of a particular class , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use when we use wireless data .
If we do that , they will cover our cups .
So where can I explain it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is a mother &apos;s language .
Research says that in other languages , you need to translate to your mother tongue .
In other languages , the skills of the mother tongue are primary to the creative expression .
How ?
Gabrian Gabriel , when he first started writing , he started using Arabic .
All of their ideas , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in the village where she grew up , felt a sense of happiness , heard a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn the literature in English , you feel the same grace , you feel the same feeling .
You can imagine that this is also their teaching in English , this little girl who was sitting in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill it .
It &apos;s a fact of emerging economies .
Germany , France , Japan and China are in all of these forces .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in their ports , they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know better ?
All right , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this advanced mindset that we don &apos;t have yet , and we want to get to this advanced world .
They were countries that were like us in an era , but decided to try to make progress , research , and move to these countries , such as Target , Ukraine , etc . , they were doing their own language , as they were doing their homes — like Hurricane .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you &apos;re a product of torture or where and where , and it &apos;s not written in the marketplace , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be included in these shelters , non-identical sharks , like we spend more time .
So to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Poverty , autonomy , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will remind you ?
What do you get ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages aren &apos;t just about talking , words are just about our own sake .
Language is a sign of the very level of our lives , and words that are mediated by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Horror , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special location in your brain — special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not a word or two or three .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our minds ?
How are you going to understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereign , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you been slogan in the period of the free ? &quot;
What would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , I better go and spend some time talking to workers .
It &apos;s that these impacts remind us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker who was a French speaker .
I was asking for this occasion .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to improve and translate his wife one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; immigrant . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Another woman spoke in the wrong word , &quot; &quot; immigrant , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand it .
He was thinking , how could someone really show up ?
Do they want to self-assemble ?
&apos;Bury me . &apos; ( English ) ( Speaking up for two ) This is one of many examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand his husband &apos;s name , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; the way he thinks about it is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he teaches me Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate it into what I feel when I hear Fridays . &quot; &quot; Bert Ms. tried to translate it , &quot; &quot; I have raised my hand and why you have it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And soon she said , &quot; &quot; Because you have me , I have left my hand and I have left you behind . &quot; &quot;
Turn it on . Turn it on .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started the vocabulary of Arabic language .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Get lost , get lost . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The main character of the Arabic language gave a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You speak it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because , you know , we didn &apos;t understand it .
And if anyone says to me , I hate speaking in Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be accomplished in a way that reflects our dreams , our desires and our daily lives .
The book is the same as ours and the same as ours .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you in the East , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the right sign .
Very simple but powerful .
After that , we started another monument with the landscape of letters on the Earth .
You &apos;ve seen one example outside of it , an organization in which the letter is in the black and white box , with the text , &quot; Stop killing . &quot;
Why ? Because really , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really don &apos;t need to kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to find a existence for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to go back to the beginning .
And these barriers , the opportunity to create novelty and religion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
Cole images of boys and girls .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No ! I put the word &quot; &quot; colol &quot; &quot; on my own . &quot; &quot; They want to make as many suggestions as two , but I &apos;m going to use the word that &apos;s good , and it &apos;s equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these aren &apos;t musicians ! We don &apos;t need to cure ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to allow anyone to grow up or to understand that we have authority in language , to press ourselves , to press ourselves , to model our own patients and to think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the skeleton or something , we can then be creative .
At this point , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a note or make a short film .
Only once again can we get to the global level .
He can re-branch Arabic in the first place .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we need to know that , and we need to think that the solution is there , that we have to be part of the solution .
Honestly , what can you do today ?
How many of you Twitter ?
To Muslims , I recommend you , though , my time is up , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But data , the Arabic script doesn &apos;t write English !
( Applause ) It &apos;s transparent ! It &apos;s no language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a legal language .
Getting back and forth is not easy .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do many other things .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;ve come here to enjoy the need for conservation in this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , is given language to its father .
When my daughter was born , I don &apos;t believe him , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I promised my daughter that in the marketplace , if she told me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , mom , &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t say &quot; Thank you .
And don &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this cultural copy . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to say that it reminds us that our presence is no secret to the presence of our presence , I was tired of those negatives that are poisoning to my people , until you see me paralyzing my generation , I &apos;m tired of that generation of inequality , not to mention our generation , not to mention our generation , not to mention democracy , not to
( Applause )
My favorite pickup trucks are the dots .
In college , my primary denominator was vegetables , which meant I had to write down multiple documents .
Now , a normal human when it writes something , this approach will happen .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to start working very slowly , but the first week , you &apos;re doing a lot of work and more work later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
Here &apos;s my approach .
My answer would be all kinds of things , but actually the work of texting is going to come to your head , and then I &apos;m going to do something like this .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all the text functions .
And then again , there &apos;s a whole research paper on the page , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my common practice was not funded to do this .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , and I decided I would do something like this .
This year , something like this will happen .
I &apos;m going to start off by tiny , middle months , and increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to scale it up more like a puzzle .
How hard is learning to do ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Go home and do something else .
So we rebuilt a major project .
( Laughter ) And then ... ( Laughter ) But then the river would get lost , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two months went by once , two weeks went by .
And then one day I would go and spend three days in the digital lobby , and I didn &apos;t write a word until now , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , I wrote down 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads — I wouldn &apos;t want to get people to be in two roads — and then I would leave the campus , spend six hours , and then I would leave
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk about your argument . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;ll look at it today , that &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it &apos;s very powerful .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about this .
My roommate always offers me six people , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brains of people are made differently than six people .
To find out , I made a leaf where I could put both brains of the same way and the brain of the chest , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look and tell me , there was a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , it &apos;s not very expensive , but look at it again .
So this is a six-man brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
There are hundreds of decisions in the two brains , but there &apos;s pleasure in the human brain .
Now , what does this mean in a serious way ?
That means everything is fine when it doesn &apos;t happen .
&#91; Going to work is the best time &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; Mind people will make decisions in order to make sense , but Ben didn &apos;t like this plan , so he can tell the story , and he says , &quot; &quot; Go pick the page for Charles &apos; page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and techno-training , because I know it &apos;s happening right now .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go to the site , and see , in 10 minutes , something new emerged ?
After this , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which is beginning to talk about the race of TED , and much later , it will end up watching the videos that the mothers of the TED Prize .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a little time for all of these things , so there &apos;s no time to do anything today .
What a shame ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the foundation of compassion that you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It seems to me that the future isn &apos;t just about two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all good .
If you know and you spend your entire life getting better and easier , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to make it , human animals are a generation .
Great food , good thought , and increasing generation , maybe from a small distance , is going to happen .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not that far off .
We are an advanced civilization , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain that decides , the smart person that makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is tell us what to do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes these seem to be the right thing to do , which is to eat simple and emotional objects like eating , sleeping , or being compassionate at moments of opportunity .
There &apos;s a catch .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is global warming .
And for the rest of the world , that bias always starts to end in one way , which spends a lot of time in the long run , a simple and mysterious path that &apos;s been out of the back .
I call it a dry land .
( Laughter ) The Dark Ages are the place where the Sistine people are so well-known .
This is where authority is at the moment when it &apos;s not supposed to be a romance .
In the dark sphere , what you find is no longer true , because it &apos;s not true , space fear , fear , caring and self-love — all the qualities that exist in the highest system .
The question is , in this way , when the open-source is broken , how does a layer of human beings go into the abyss , which is less happy , but more important ?
It &apos;s proven that the system also has protected people , which is keeping them safe every time in its dark spots — somebody mentioned it at home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household thing that &apos;s more familiar , but when David Line is approaching it , it &apos;s wonderful , or it &apos;s when people are at risk of embarrassing , occupying or scary results .
And the important thing is that the interior is just like that .
Now I had a relationship with this in my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) So obviously I did .
My dream was attended to TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something else going on in the brain of conscious decision-making .
He was saying , &quot; Did you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the map of India at the bottom of the 20th century , we &apos;ll just do a big house when we don &apos;t see India , and feel great about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a month later , people at TED decided to name the Koreans .
I was blogging and taking a picture of me holding home .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) High-performing homeless people , and within a few seconds , the system turned out to be on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he &apos;s frightened of the houses — he rolls down the tree !
And finally , finally , long-term decision-makers sent in and I can start to work on conversation .
Now the homework assignment that every category tells you to pay for a bribe , like me , how someone like me would give two weeks to two weeks and the beginning of a bribe is not going to be written , and then , amazingly , the unbelievable advice of operation will give you to go to the night and write your email .
And the total of three cleanlines in this case are called the Sistine People &apos;s system .
That &apos;s great , so it &apos;s not easy to do .
And a few years ago , I decided to write blogs about this .
When I wrote this , I was amazed at the impact that this had on me .
In fact , I received thousands of emails from all over the world and from people who had different kinds of emotions .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and also the CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them said one thing and wrote : &quot; I am in the face of this issue . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of questions I got from email and email address .
There was a silence in those people &apos;s scripts about how much Solly wrote about her life , about what she did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are all these people in the dark ?
It turns out there are two sets on the side .
Today I gave you all examples , talking about subjects , all of them were data lines .
And when David &apos;s lying , recent effects are critical for killing the house .
But the sixth one is a different kind of thing , and it &apos;s not about any digital link .
So if you want to do a project like this , which you start out like some art or business — like some art or business , until you start finding yourself accelerating to work .
In addition to doing so , there are many things that David Lunn doesn &apos;t have , like getting from his family , exercising , thinking about your health , thinking about your relationships , telling your relationships better than not being able to talk about .
Now if the only way to work on the Sistine Chapter is to work , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data sets in the context of the spinal cord that &apos;s missing .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t deliver them , they &apos;re always with your dad .
And this is a typical metaphor for a much less glamorous way of looking at it and talking less about it than just virtual measurements of death , disgust of basic ideas .
You &apos;re making headlines out of loud and sound .
And this can be true of vital importance and reconciliation .
So I thought that was the reason they had email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the rain .
They &apos;re not set up to plan .
The Taliban Treasury spotted them , sometimes in their own lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot afford to pay for their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I found all the emails , and one thing emerged — I think six people didn &apos;t exist .
I think you &apos;re all people .
It may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) — and maybe some of you have had good relationships with the digital link , but remember the keys when the digital lines don &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one final thing .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block represents a week , it &apos;s a new year .
There aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when there are some of them .
I think we all need to be able to take care of this cliff .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because there &apos;s no one in every life that &apos;s free .
We need to be careful .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have a home on this ; maybe we should start with this .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
A collection of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan warfare were moving from one area of Afghanistan to one area of Afghanistan , to help provide a foundation for the Afghan government to help provide a foundation for the Afghan government to help provide a foundation for the Afghan government to help provide a foundation for the government to help provide a foundation for the Afghan government to help provide a foundation
He arrived at the end of an attack , and he lived around three , and with a lot of things , he watched Captain Seventine as a child , he watched Captain Seventine as a child , and he watched as the couples come and save and take the patients away .
One of the people who know his children , one of the orchestras and one of the Spanish doctrines , was moving towards one helicopter and one of the other Spanish numbers were moving towards one helicopter .
It &apos;s been shown that the Cape Seventine and the Homo erectus contain this mysterious facial expression that occurs in the garden .
They put it into the helicopter and then you see what happens when the captain sits there and then you give it to others before they can infect others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where did people come from ?
What is this ? These are incredibly powerful emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why I work with people , they don &apos;t .
You know , at the end of the day , people who are desperate to win themselves so that others can benefit .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are desperate to win others so that we can benefit .
We have an online computer .
So I asked myself , where did people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re moving sideways .
These better people embrace the imagination of services , these better people embrace the imagination of services .
But it &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is the environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so each of us has the capacity to work together and extend it so that we have the capacity to do this in others .
I have the privilege of bringing together some of these people , and we call them &quot; &quot; Heroes . &quot; &quot; And I have the privilege of bringing together some of these people , and we call them heroes , and they put themselves at risk for saving others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are not important .
The difficulty with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these emotions are not obstacles .
I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; Pass me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I give two people the chance to collaborate and do that .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago , at the very beginning of the Homo sapiens &apos; dawn , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all of these sites are very focused on us .
No personal matter .
Whether it &apos;s a waste of resources , it &apos;s a very powerful tweet , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan , all of these things together , to reduce our lifespan .
And so we &apos;re ready in the form of social animals where we &apos;re all sitting together and doing what I call a &quot; &quot; public &quot; &quot; part , like a closet where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we were compassionate and committed .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can sleep at night and I can sleep at night and see some dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you , it means you &apos;re not going to look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by dangers , things that are trying to make our lives difficult , or trying to reduce our success , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re trying to reduce our opportunity to achieve .
These can be societies that can scale beyond the standard model .
This can be a new technology that will take your commercial break away at one o &apos;clock in the evening , and it can be a new technology that will allow your commercial break for a night .
Or it could be your opposite , which sometimes attempts to cheat .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s trying to get you out of business and try to get your business going . It &apos;s trying to get you out of business and get your business going .
We have no authority on those power .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where gravity takes place because it &apos;s determined by what direction it is .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives and lives of the people in the organization that are contributing to protect the people and the lives of the people in the organization , and that is that they judge their honor and good outcomes so that people can live , and that is that they judge their honor and good outcomes to make people feel secure and feel secure about their own personal relationships , that &apos;s when the
I was walking along a new journey , and I realized a fact that when a voyage passed , before he tried to catch it , and I saw employees on the front door just like he passed the law as he was crying .
One of the first things that I tried to get at was this : One of the first things I tried to get at it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you cutting things like that ?
Why can &apos;t you keep up with people like us ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Billions is not because they &apos;re giving lentils to people who live better .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their leaders .
You see , if conditions are abundant , we spend our time and our strength protecting yourself from one another , we spend our time and strength protecting yourself from one another and therefore reducing the organization .
What a great leader can give you the most close example of how to be a parent is a great leader , and to have the most close example of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s necessary , we want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the discipline , when it &apos;s needed , so that they can grow and get more of what we can do for themselves , so that they can grow and get more of what we can do for ourselves .
All right leaders want that .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunity , the education , the discipline , the order , when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to build confidence , they want to have time and not work so that they can achieve more achievements than we &apos;ve ever imagined , so that they can achieve more achievements
Charley Kim , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called the Next Jump , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City , says one thing : If your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever spend your child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley did not refuse to practice the wholesale labor , and Charley did not refuse to practice the wholesale labor .
If you &apos;re working in Next Jump , you &apos;re not going to be working on the basis of efficiency .
But if you &apos;ve got a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , exactly like we &apos;re going to do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why there are so many people who are so frustrated and angry , some bankers from CEOs , and that &apos;s why they have so many people who are so frustrated and angry , some bankers from CEOs , and that &apos;s because there are so many people who are so frustrated and angry , some brands from CEOs who are unequally frustrated and terrified .
It &apos;s not data .
But they &apos;ve come up with fundamental laws of gravity .
They &apos;ve grown a diverse social society .
We know that they &apos;ve tried to convince their offspring because of their offspring , we know that they &apos;ve tried to convince their offspring because of their offspring , but that they &apos;ve tried to convince their offspring because of their offspring , but that they &apos;ve tried to convince their offspring because of their offspring .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re proposing , not data .
Is there any reason why the Gowanus spent 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t teachers give 250 million dollars to bonuses ?
Is there a problem with this ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
They &apos;re going to give people skin data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people skin data to save .
Bush Chapter under the Media Lab is running a mining company in Baby Chapter , and they run a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they were running the largest trader , and they were turning 30 percent of their drivers into the night .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy the property .
They needed 10 million dollars to have children , and so many of the companies now have had board people doing huge things .
And Bob answered that .
You can see that the Bush Administration does not believe in cheating .
It &apos;s very hard to get people to believe in cheating , and it &apos;s very difficult to get people to lose weight .
And then they built a dedicated program .
That every employee , from the censorship to the CEO , was forced to deliver everyone in the fourth week without hesitation .
They could do it any time they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But as Boob declared the program , he was very important .
He said that it &apos;s better than all of us to make small doses of money , that some of us would receive much higher rates and get a lot higher .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as people expect , when they feel protected from a group , trust and cooperation is natural .
And basically , as nobody expected , people started trading from each other .
What was more successful was business with low-success families .
That is , something has sacrificed five sacrifices so that one person can only have three digits left .
Gravity is not an option .
I know many people who are at the top of organizations , I know many people who are at the top of organizations who are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re supposed to be entrepreneurs and we do what they say , because they get to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in the middle of organizations who are not authoritarian and who are real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the authority to look at their left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been compassionate to look at the person on the left , and they &apos;ve been compassionate to look at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve been compassionate to look at the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I &apos;ve heard a story about some of the science that was going on out in the theater , and just as the technique of science is that the man eats honey and he eats his men first , and when he eats , he doesn &apos;t have anything to eat .
And when he came back into the field , his friends gave him some food from his dinner so he could eat because it was .
We tell them they do it first .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered first , we call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can protect them , we call them the leaders , because they choose to be the victims so that people can protect them and make a difference , and when we do that , it becomes very sensible for our people to give us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their penis and then they &apos;ll see that their aspiration becomes real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; How are you going to do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your pancreas and you give it to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they &apos;re doing it for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to work for ?
And aren &apos;t those organizations that we would all love to do ? And aren &apos;t those organizations that we would all love to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up on a small story of Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the water supply is incredibly unbelievable , like casualties , and growing up in these conditions is very difficult for me once in 17 years old , I was staying still in the garden with friends in the mud .
The sun in the winter is very hot .
And as I was speaking in the corner , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent something that just shows up on your skin and doesn &apos;t have to hurt you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I need it . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research , and I got some surprising statistics .
Today in the world , more than 2.5 billion people have no access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and almost all of them are in South Africa .
Different diseases invade the environment , which is the most dangerous chromosome .
One of the reasons dilemmas occur in the eye is because tragedy is one of the biggest decisions of tragedy that you can be instantly connected .
This disease kills eight million people every year on a continuous basis , and the biggest thing that comes out of your chromosome is you just have to give yourself a taste : no taste , no gradients , no engineering .
After looking at the data from Afghanistan , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I took my brother &apos;s 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a web broadcast , I went to Google and I did some research on Wikipedia , I
And I looked at this as a particularly important problem .
So Mahammad said it was right , our pheromone was ready .
Now we need to do this in the process .
Four years later , when the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses placed on my phone , I am the largest patent holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; no more gold ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t tell you more about it . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mystery exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to be bright .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Middle East came in with some new people , did more of this , and now we have a fully focused model , which is ready to build in the marketplace , now available in the marketplace .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They &apos;re just buying under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket , they buy a ticket every day because it &apos;s more important .
So we put DryBath in these creative blocks .
You put it between them and out .
And the best thing is , a simple one replaced only in five .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about waste from products .
We also want DryBath the extended warning of the air here . ( Laughter ) Less than once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water , on average , whenever they leave , and we could save two houses for children , which are in the areas where they live , two houses , more dark rooms for the schools , two houses for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it out of our key value of being clean and solid .
DryBath is a poor man &apos;s service and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually entering a process of solving this project , now in a period of multinational that can be sold in the retail market , and one question for my audience today , at Limpopo Current , we &apos;re going to launch a 50th anniversary of an ounce of not covering the world .
Do you regret it ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot of things during this recent process , Google announced me last year as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur in the world , the first African who has accumulated , and one thing that surprises me is why all of this praise did not want to be done . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m here today to share with you some of the results that I &apos;ve found , and I &apos;ve been surprised to myself , what are the key causes of success in organizations , which are actually due to initial success .
I believe that NGOs are the best way to create a better place in the world .
If you select a group of people with the desire to eat and organize them at the beginning , you will find the human potential that was once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are really the best , why is it that most of them failures ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success in the beginning .
I wanted to know so many organizations about this , pushing my wrongful ideas and misconceptions from some of the other organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was growing up at 12 years old at a variety of different businesses that were coming out of the low-performing steps at the low-performing low-performing low-performing low-performing schools .
I graduated from college , and I started a foundation called Software .
And 20 years ago , the idea started Libya , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve made more than 100 companies , many successes , many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to look at these factors and say the greatest cause of success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there &apos;s something here .
So I called my company &quot; &quot; Idea Libra &quot; &quot; the old days that you feel about it .
With grief , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to diagnose or decrease , are more important factors .
I never thought it was going to be appreciated by researcher Mike Titon , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s a plan , until I don &apos;t have a mom . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It &apos;s important for a team to be able to determine the ability to move from one side of the road .
Each one is an elite fact .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important thing .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about income ?
With that in mind , it seemed to me that what is most important for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes organizations make a big investment .
Could that be the most important ?
Of course , after that — is it time ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t prepared for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or is it too late , and before there &apos;s so many attacks ?
So I took a lot of respect from these five factors in many organizations .
And the idea was to hire 100 companies in Libya , and hundreds of them outside to try and find a scientific result .
So first of all , on these ideas , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all commercials for dollars .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Disktop Factory , Peoplelink — were hopeful for us , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to model all these characteristics , as I think these companies were progressing in these places .
Then in the outsiders of Libya , I saw strange successes like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here are some of the failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and windows .
There was tremendous investment in new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to understand that the greatest effect of all these companies was success and failure , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was choosing time .
42 percent of the time is due to success and failure .
The team and the team are on the other side of the spectrum , and then I think , being different from the idea , being different from the idea , is really a third number .
But in fact , it &apos;s not true , nor does mindset matter , but it surprised me that thinking is not the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment comes in my mind .
I think the market model doesn &apos;t really matter because you can start without a market model , and then you can include the product in cities .
And investment , if initially low investment , is now increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you a few examples here of all these nodes .
Take a major airbnb , as you all know .
It &apos;s very popular that a lot of investors were paying attention to this company because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to be the ticker part of your house ?
Of course , this proved to be false .
One of the reasons why gross is successful is because of the best market model , I think , and the best market value , is because of the right time .
This company came forward in a long way when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people to respond to a bankruptcy bias in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best commercial model , also the best viewer .
However , time was exactly right to make the donors they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional income ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch arrived at the time when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 , back in 1998 , when companies wanted to look at more grandmothers .
We thought it was best , but in fact , the right time probably took more .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about this — with a lot of collaborators and a great commercial examination , to work with the great leaders in Hollywood .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broad band was very low .
It was very difficult to watch the video , you didn &apos;t know what to do in your broadcaster , and finally this company did in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of the cocaine and broadband band in America , more than 50 percent of it started , YouTube got the best time .
Great idea , good time .
It turns out that YouTube didn &apos;t have a business model when it started .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was the absolute best choice .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
The idea is very important .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if they really are willing to act on your behalf .
And the real confidence is that what comes out of those results is not from them , because if something you like , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work with lots of confidence in terms of time .
As I said earlier , organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help improve your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , you &apos;re the best audience .

&#91; 3 a.m. in 2016 we saw the greatest data set in history . &#93; &#91; Financial access to rich and powerful people . &#93; &#91; What does it mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Robert Ventures to illustrate this . &#93; &#91; Financial accent this week was central to the evolution of the two campaign that brought the giant millions of cash forward from the Patriot Act . &#93; &#91;
Fifty of those papers were published by secret weapons companies .
We know the inner stories of villages , banks and villages coming in with funeral forms and saying , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a home company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messaging , you can look at how to do things , how to do things .
Its implications are starting to emerge .
The Chief Justice of Ice Land has been known .
We also have this news that veterinarians are covered with barbed wires .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of revenue goes to the Ross Ice Shelf with his childhood friend , the famous Sistine .
And many poor people will be contacted , and those who will be contacted by the stories of the future will be back home .
Now this is a story of a magic film , or a story of an ethos of Judaism .
What should we do about it ?
But the fact that the agrarian and the powerful people are sitting in the seats of their own money , and the amount that they don &apos;t need to be taxed doesn &apos;t mean that they have good actions , like good actions , for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , Galapagos Ventures , this is amazing .
Global media and political leaders , they &apos;re talking about how people in shell companies have their own influence on what we &apos;ve been talking about for decades .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful , wonderful world for people , and it &apos;s very difficult to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like a road map .
You can run another company inside a company , another company inside , which is pretty much impossible to figure out who is behind this box .
Law enforcement agencies have a hard time figuring out what &apos;s going on .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that we haven &apos;t heard a lot about this in America .
Maybe it &apos;s not because of America &apos;s famous schedule .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean poor people in America are not investing in poor people .
That &apos;s why the U.S. Foundation approach works , there &apos;s only a few of them .
I think if we &apos;re going to discover anything like Kim Illinand or Dell Wair or the Wall or the nomad , it &apos;s kind of like the relationship between America .
But a lot of the American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give little information to run for the company , even from the library cards .
In American schools , this information is given to students .
It makes nine units of investment accessible .
It &apos;s a condition that affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to see how this machine works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we transformed a grant to ship the 13 cleaning companies in Manhattan .
Our foundation became the soldier of Africa who wanted to move to America , a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The heart attack was that all the villages could provide a one-by-one instance of how to move the tooth .
These were all primary meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our own money , and we didn &apos;t give any money , but it was a bad idea of the system .
It &apos;s also important that it doesn &apos;t address it as an individual issue .
It &apos;s not about individual voices that talked about our distraction and our distraction .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who was found in Scanda .
This is a system that works , that cleans Texas , that protects television , dignity and unemployment .
And to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it hard to create in this way .
It can be imaginative , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful are always going to be .
But given a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the capacity of the company is .
This issue was posted on political issues , but the British Secretary of Defense Department of Defense committed 8 states in the G8 Summit in the South Land in 2013 .
And European Union is now creating a central record of climate change , whether it &apos;s actually who &apos;s the country or are controlling it .
The evidence is that HIV is behind it .
The mapping of the violent law disappears in the center and the network , which we didn &apos;t want to go up very quickly , so we got 15 .
We want to look at inventions , larger sectors of large-scale companies , all around the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Galapagos .
We need to reach out to the people who know what they know behind barber companies .
However , let &apos;s hear them speak up , that it &apos;s not good for this kind of reasoning , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to encourage the legislative change to access information .
We can break down the pathways , the secrets that are driving the pathways of taxation and the breakthroughs .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It says why , what you invented , in the last few years , there have been so much sensation available that is beyond all the media in the world .
Can it happen ?
Julian Singer : Yeah , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a question of — what &apos;s not ? — that the media of the world is showing a very poor performance of individuals who are able to perform a small group of information like this , which is far more than all the media in the world .
CA : How is that ?
How do people make arrangements ?
And how do you stay tuned ?
Julian Singer : There we are . Here I can tell you — there are civil services in the right way , and we have many ways to get the information to us .
So we use a lot of high-level storage to put materials from one place on the Internet , to send signals back to the legal authorities , such as Sudan and blogging .
We get the information in the form of a database , in the standard database , in the name of Rome Shirt or whatever , organizations like typical newspaper organizations , failing — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about giving massive information to people , and then protecting yourself against the legislative and political leaders .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to try to make sure that the documents are the actual ones , but you actually never know what the tools are .
Julian Singer : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;re always going to get this information , and if we get to the point where we &apos;re going to get it right , we &apos;re going to get the information straight away from the skin .
( Whistling ) God bless her .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of like this and you &apos;re wondering what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you thought and what happened ?
Julian Singer : Yeah , that &apos;s a roll report .
This was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government there was 18 years of digital harvest .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when the book came in — because of the original forces that were trying to decide how to do it — they bought 20 million pounds of the report card and one of the other reports .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for its political will , which was the poorest people — now the poorest people in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ for the Kenyan press .
That &apos;s why it was convened in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this , first of all , elections in December 2008 .
When we got that report , three days later , we decided to volunteer the company , Kabul decided to volunteer the person that he was so terrified of , Daniel Armada , so this reporter was sent to the Gulf of Cairo .
CA : And — I mean , I mean , just briefly , it &apos;s — it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by the craftsmanship , but by the mean , it &apos;s changed the outcome of your choice .
GG : Yes . This was the coverage of Gaddafi , and then it spread across the entire country of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came out .
And he , after a few minutes , trusted the Kenyan Embassy to talk about it .
And this car sits on TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equation 10 percent , according to a Chinese Internet report , and it changed the result .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your secret ideas actually changed the world ?
GG : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re going to show a little video of a little tiny , little cross-section video .
It &apos;s a long video , but here &apos;s a little clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart attack .
RD : It was tough , when you first met them and you blew them up .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
The path is clear . Okay . Galen &apos;s going .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me . Go ahead .
All dollars .
Hold on ! Glass !
( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running .
Hatel — two engineers , two engineers .
We need to move now , time is coming !
Okay , now we killed eight people with our hands .
Here we see two old Hilly cafeteria , and we &apos;re still having plastics .
Roger . They &apos;re on my show .
Two sides , that &apos;s two sides , we &apos;re on the roof .
Oh , what a society . What was happening ?
God bless you , Hell . All right . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what happened ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We ended up doing more research with two people .
These were the first three times that happened .
CA : So 11 people in this case were killed , right , two people in the general director ?
Juliet Singer : Yes ! Two rollers , two small children were killed .
In total , from 18 to 26 people were killed .
CA : And after his executive , he got a lot of press .
What was the basic reason he was lying , you know ?
Julian Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as being incredibly imbalances of power .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the grass , and then a kilometer away , Hilly Copter begins to scratch the surface of 30 miles of electricity on either of them — either of them — and gives birth to children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t in any way terrible , because they were journalists .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining got arrested , and it said that he had confirmed in St. Rome that he had confirmed this video to you about 280,000 and FDs across the U.S.
Did it really happen ?
Julian Singer : So we decided to accept the documents .
It was published five days ago that they received 150,000 documents and 50 .
But we &apos;ve now done what we &apos;ve done in the beginning of the year , one of the providers of the River and the U.S. safety house , but there &apos;s no correlation behind them .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of accessories from the U.S. safety house ...
Julian Singer : We &apos;re going to give them what we &apos;re going to do . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do ? ) Juliet Singer : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Singer : Because these things are showing that , actually , what are the states of Arab states , these states are actually violating human rights .
If you look at cave documents , the material in this form is within them .
CA : Talk about that .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it true that you need to create secret information ?
Julian Singer : So the question is how important information in the world is , what information can &apos;t be stored .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that organizations spend money on , and it &apos;s a great sign that when they want to get the information out , they have hope to do something good , because what organizations know better , and they know more about it , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there dangers to make individually or collectively a large society where you don &apos;t expect to get out of the way ?
Julian Singer : We didn &apos;t do what we had with them .
I mean , our biggest obstacle is practice .
With information , we &apos;re able to gather in a very particular way the information that &apos;s being collected — the information that &apos;s being collected from somebody else .
But there are also some myths — like your Ph.D. has your knowledge ; it &apos;s a miracle mystery — but we &apos;re talking about these civic goods that come in and out of your mind .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing this with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , whose daughter &apos;s daughter is in the United States Senate , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had this effect that some people like to hug each other .
It shows an American fanciful expression of dead people .
Which is — but it has given millions of people around the world that the United States is a physical envy .
Although they &apos;re not , my daughter &apos;s not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julian Singer : Here &apos;s how we ask a lot of questions like this .
But remember in the ghettos , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people — don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what they think , it doesn &apos;t matter what they think .
Because they see it all day long .
It &apos;s going to change their mind and thinking about how they spend money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re looking at hope for what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it sound ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light you have to maintain yourself in this way ?
Julian Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we don &apos;t have any different species .
We have no idea what other minds are like .
If they do that , it &apos;s a very difficult situation for us to do that , but what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re making people moral compassionate about how they &apos;re going to grow up later on .
CA : I think we &apos;ve made it to what we know — it &apos;s to come from the innocent .
You can also imagine that there will be different ideas about why and why .
One is the hero of hope .
Or problem creation .
What is the point of the hero ?
And what &apos;s the problem ?
Julian Singer : Oh ! Something you want to be .
CA : These are very good people , Julie , very good .
We have to try and do it . Let me show you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Now this is a very interesting story , which is old , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Singer : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year — in the middle of November , a lot of important roads were put together in bananas , like the cell in Mexico , but not so big .
And we got reports — which happened to be a very good experiment about it — which was said that , in fact , conservation agencies were contracting different oil companies , and they got there and they got there .
And there was something about the federal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report , so for us it was a very difficult task .
We couldn &apos;t anticipate it because we didn &apos;t know who he was writing and what it was about .
So we were surprised that maybe this was a company that did all this in some contrast .
We gave it to the foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is good , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that he wrote it , he wanted to write it large . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to write the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by this ?
Is that really yours ? Well , they brought it back to us , looking at Scripin , using the name of factory , microflute , LED .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It happened many times .
This is our way of revealing and imagining what materials are , and trying to write and get written by these people .
CA : All right . So , when did you get the information from inside the BBC ?
Julian Singer : Yeah , we &apos;ve got a lot of stuff , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re collecting and mixing things out of the hard stages .
Our demand for this has become something that has become commonplace in the past few months , because we improve our budget system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s raw .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s already starting , we &apos;re starting to stumble upon ourselves more because of our growth , and what that means is that we have a lot of civic services , very smart , but we don &apos;t have people who can modify and visualize this information .
CA : So that &apos;s a real issue , basically , why are some recruiters or journalists aspiring ?
Julie Singer : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we have an organization that is extremely difficult to solve because the material that we have to deal with , so we have to reorganize so that we can connect people who have a lot of sensitivity to work on material conservation , and then less sensitivity to business .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think where I learned that you went to 37 different schools in a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Singer : Yeah , my parents were in the movie business , and then moving away from the street , so the two things had an effect .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychiatrist , so it &apos;s saying that anything that can be done can be created by the brain .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one at a young age , and you got into the workshop very quickly .
Julie Singer : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist , a journalist .
I wrote a letter , and I was a girl at the time when this crime hit me .
To do that , you need to appreciate the word .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Russian monsoon that &apos;s using your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not the word that it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your main value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and maybe some event in your life that helped them do ?
Julian Singer : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But basic values : well , good , tough people don &apos;t generate masters ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s the greatest lesson I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brave and hard people who live in my life .
CA : Brilliant and heavy people are not born to immigrants ?
Julian Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to grow mammals , which is closer to police , has crime .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : So we just got to the end of the day and just say , what happened in Iceland ?
Basically , you put something out there , you &apos;ve got a banking problem , and then you &apos;ve got the newspaper there that tells the story to prevent it from happening .
Instead they showed up for you .
So you &apos;re very famous in the Iceland . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ice Land went through a crisis .
There was the highest .
There were tens of thousands of bankers living there under the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did it in July last year .
And the state of Vienna had a little bit of contradiction since she was there five minutes ago , like a movie : She jumped on the Supreme Court , and the state of New Reader was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed up the website , spent all this time , and we got a lot of popular in Iceland , and I went to Iceland and talked about this issue .
And the elements of the people there were things that shouldn &apos;t be happening again , and as a result , the scientists in the South Land , working with some other international ambassadors , we lobbied a new type of law called the OECD , which is a kind of free media , the most protected area for journalists all over the world , for the most protected New Apple prince , for free .
A nation of the North Atlantic right whale is like a nursery , which is heading up from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Iceland Parliament sponsored this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look towards the future , did you realize that there was a greater extent to show power and power , greater security , or to see all of us , greater power , or is it going to hit the ground ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure to deal with the law of liberty and the law of transparency , globally — between Europe , China and the U.S.
What &apos;s going to happen ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live — because from a small effort , we can move from one side to the other .
CA : All right , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience &apos;s ideas , they &apos;re called , gealists , they &apos;re precious , and all the power is for you .
Julie Singer : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was busy in food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is a small batch .
I spent my childhood living through the circumstances of my childhood connectome , and I saw these reverberation tables .
When I grew up in college and came back in the early 1990s , I got this .
My team broke .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mystery , it occurred to me , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to places like the Middle East , where I was blown away by the North Carolina , Piracy , or the city of London , I noticed that there were four species of organisms reaching for mines — well , fine , touch , silence and code .
And I thought this was a big bizarre thing , and I was amazed to see if anyone else had ever gotten their hands on this curve .
And when I looked at it , I realized people weren &apos;t watching the Catholic team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
By restricting the natural world to a few elements , there is no unusual human nature .
This is something we did 10,000 years ago when we analyzed our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , they will look at blood vessels and blood vessels and look at all sorts of creatures like this .
But if you look at the order of 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cow , cow , cow and cow .
It &apos;s also true of being a parent .
If you look at mine 150 or 200 years ago in New York City , you &apos;ll see soap , paper and south .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of magnitude , spinning , but also starving .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Shah .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
We &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The Second World War gave us the greatest motivation to be strong .
During the Great War , we &apos;ve advanced technology , like the Sun , like the plutonium , and all of these things have taken place .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have to see the greatest increase in the ability to measure measure .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that soap operas and ocean agriculture have been increasing , and then over the next two years , their resources have been increasing in crop yields .
Now if you collect fertilizer and forestry , it will be equal to two China per year from the ocean .
My favorite example of using Chinese coherence is not one , because China is not only one of the largest emitters , but it &apos;s also the largest emitter .
Let &apos;s now turn to our four choices .
The first one is the most abundant sea food in the United States and the West .
The forest is an extremely bad battle .
Only one cubic foot of logging takes five , 10 , or 15 pounds of logging to market .
The Indus script also is incredibly precise .
In a study done in Darwinian neuroscience , it proved that the water from the water from the houses is completely ineffective for refining carbon .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where the battlefields are lying in the region , they are mangroves .
Now look at these nice crosses .
They &apos;re tracking the Earth &apos;s material from its location to protect the coast , the yeast and the yeast and all the critical things for the environment .
A lot of the issues in the Gulf of Mongolia happened .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years feeding millions of coal miners .
Another thing that &apos;s happening here , which is what the philosopher Marc Bennman calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the track , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Today , there are some things that are smaller than the bed net , but with it , with it enormous amounts of other mosquitos that breed and transform food into smallpox .
And many times , there &apos;s been a lot of work done on the places called the Red Brigades , which is the stuff that we like to look at on the river , which means changing it into food , which means that the ecosystem is feeding itself and creating cool stuff .
After that , there &apos;s another great food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You have to look at very large areas for organization .
We also have our own neighborhood , what scientists call &quot; &quot; arguing mentors &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; ICCAT . &quot; &quot; Intelligent Poetry to protect yourself against neutral sound .
Carl Saffin also volunteered a great deal of detecting all of this stuff .
We can break ground for tea , but there &apos;s no good breakthrough for tea .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tuna &apos;s warm blood .
It &apos;s over 40 miles per gallon , and it can heat up to 20 bucks a gallon in its environment .
All of the pieces of paper are finished .
The fresh water is filled with blood that doesn &apos;t eat as much .
This is the best for protein .
But the forest creature surprised at 40 miles an hour is not able to stay in the farm .
Sime has died , and it doesn &apos;t need to be caused by the atrocities .
This is my political contact .
Connecticut was running out of service .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every dot is a document .
There are 3,000 signs in the politics of Connecticut .
Actually , I say there &apos;s a lot of people in the connectome — ( Laughter ) if anyone has the power of contact , I think we can totally improve the world .
And everywhere we go , these are rockets that travel from nowhere to nowhere to go .
As a result , we have a success story on the horizon and on the temporal lobe .
When the space shuttle began , the space shuttle was hitting six pounds of forest to build a foundation .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
One of the things that happens is that this little squid is also wrong , because if you look at the French footage , they name the squid peanut button in the change of the site .
While it &apos;s feedback looped with the lead .
Some people say leatherbacks and leatherbacks are hard to say .
But then again , the credit card industry tells you that it &apos;s been decreasing the bad jobs of the pound people .
This is a system created by the Ecuadorian Amazon Basin .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent per year .
Even though we &apos;re spending a little bit less money getting into the market , we &apos;re still spending a lot of money .
Not only do we feed mice , but we feed mice and souls .
We have what we eat and we have what we eat and what we eat .
Because on top of it , the blood and hands and so forth add bullets .
I wonder if there &apos;s any passion that has made it and that passion has emerged .
India is first or first to die . ( Laughter ) And as a result , this is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of wildlife that &apos;s taken out of the ocean .
It &apos;s equal to the third of China or the number of people in the United States who get out of the ocean every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia literally started as an elephant .
And it started with a local manufacturer who saw that the next day , no one would ever be on mosquitos .
She came up to the bank and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
It was one of the demonstrations that the Cendic would take longer for the ocean , but it was one of the evidence that Hulu didn &apos;t kill .
So he made his own liposuction probe .
Unfortunately , the censorship came in 30 centimeters .
He wanted to build a 25-centimeter census , so he brought in the satellite code .
The entire photographic entertainment facility affords the Paul Alaska , the largest mass industry in the United States of America , with arts travel from two to three billion pounds a year off the sea .
If we stopped polio , the current option might be tripled .
20 years ago , Thailand had no idea .
This is transforming the planet &apos;s protein in a very powerful way in animal protein , and this is the third world for me .
Actually , this is a very compelling solution that &apos;s coming out of an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a silly cigarette .
There &apos;s no epidemic of HIV and AIDS that we think is going to keep us alive all the time .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That &apos;s three million tons in size .
One possibility that conservation community has suggested is , can we eat it ?
Can we play it right instead of giving it to people ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , which is the traditional part of slavery compared to laughter , and the most effective parts of the country &apos;s money .
This is October 3 , EPA and DIY .
So this is her potential .
But instead of giving away a few dollars &apos; worth of pay or pay or pay or pay , we turned it into Google , we brought in the toilet and we could clean up the toilet to spend more money ?
The other thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
Indus numbers have a profound effect .
The revenue of India to the market is only three parts .
Actually , the average of three doesn &apos;t come from the kitchen .
The ocean is three stories tall , so they &apos;re just collected .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western hemisphere , the use of Facebook and neuroscience has been displaced .
Over the past two decades , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , and that &apos;s a great death of ocean life .
As you can think about the clip , in all these different circles , there are more than three protons and more frequently these are very effective targets .
It &apos;s just like the real thing .
And the last puzzle is a question mark .
We can create a pattern that can be proven to be more useful for ocean protein .
This creature needs to be green , has the ability to grow and change rapidly , and it has the ability to shape it , and it wants to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Gate East .
This is already in paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But he &apos;s not trying to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the ocean .
I mean , this is all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , the issue becomes more generous .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was raised to expand the brain because I have a brother who is a neurological disorder .
More and more , I wanted to understand , as a scientist , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what is it that they cannot integrate their dreams from the public and the collective truth , and they do so .
So I dedicated my life to exploring serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from India , where I worked for Dr. Frankenstein Bank , who was a psychiatrist at Harvard University .
Because what was the difference in the physiological level of the brain of these people who are generally imagined as being compared to the brain of the people who are in Scottish Scottish Scottish Scottish , or Baja Pauder , is it that we were actually trying to make a map of the microbial microscope in the brain , and who are the cells that are sending the message , &quot; &quot; What is the
So there was a lot of priority in my life because I was doing this research in the day , but on Christmas and Sunday , I was on my weekend at Nanal Alice on a pilgrimage to NASA .
But on December 10 , 1996 , I found myself in front of an intellectual record .
On the left side of my brain was a nine strokes .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely dissolve by any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and remind myself in the morning of Philadelphia .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever looked at the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely separate from each other .
I created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that &apos;s in the back of my brain , and it &apos;s going to be held in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two pieces of this brain which are completely separate from each other .
Those of you who think computers work like a parallel processor on the right part of our brain works like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain works like a parallel processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through the crossroads of a torture-centric organism that collects 300 volunteers .
But there are two sides of it .
Because they understand information in a different way , each part of the consciousness understands totally different information , their facial expressions are different things , and you allow them to tell me who they are , very different from each other .
Compassion : Thank you . Compassion .
Audience member : Yes , a lot more .
( Laughter ) The evidence of our brains is just recently and think about this moment .
Here , right now , the evidence of our brain in some of the images that we &apos;re thinking about is organ thinking about the movements of our bodies .
Information flows through our bodies and gives way to our whole system of neuroscience , and then it creates a giant alumni class that tells us what exists in the context of how to feel and how to feel in the mind .
I &apos;m an energy bound by the energy that &apos;s contained by the right part of the brain .
We &apos;re using energy from one another , from the right part of the brain , to the right part of the brain , as a human family .
And at this point , we are brothers from this planet who are dedicated to making the world better .
And at this point , we are all the best and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The left part of our brain is about space and future .
The construction of the left part of the brain is such that we are now beginning to collect the largest aluminum or cloud that we have , and then we begin to collect analyses and analyses .
And it also informs organization and empowerment of all of the things that are in the material that we have learned in the past and determines the probabilities of the future , namely the effects of our projects .
The left part of our brain is thinking in language .
It &apos;s a sequence of conversations that unites us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me to go home and buy and remember .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a conscious mind that I write my computer book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the one that says I am ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I am becoming disabled .
I become the only person in the world with the incredible amount of energy around you and so on .
And the only part of my brain that happened that morning was filled with the faucet .
My left eye in the morning of the collision charged with pain .
It was suffering from severe pain like chicken soup .
And that pain just dragged me back and forth .
And then he left and went .
And it was extraordinary to me that I had never had any pain before , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No way , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I put on my cardboard cardboard , which is a body training machine .
Now I &apos;m looking forward to this machine , and it makes me feel like my hand is just the tip of an initial human being that stretched the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is such a strange thing . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being , which is coming out of the machine , but now I was in a previous and mysterious place where my consciousness was
And it was all very strange and poor , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started running around the room , and I felt like everything inside my body was straight .
And all of them are very difficult and very thinkable .
I have no reference to my speed , and I think a homework problem is focused only on the internal system .
I &apos;m standing in my closet , preparing to be underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice saying , &quot; &quot; My father has to stop you now .
My brother , you get dressed up , and then I &apos;m not balancing my balance , so I &apos;m scribbling and hearing the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that now I can &apos;t repair my body &apos;s waste .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand was held together by atoms and magnetic walls .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the stuff on the left of my brain got completely silent .
It was like someone was speaking the voice of TVs on a regular monitor .
One more time .
First , I was surprised by the wiring of my brain .
But then immediately , just like in another laptop , this huge spacecraft that was all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt enormous grief and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a bone died on the left side of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; You are a lesbian . &quot;
So we need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really removed from any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really removed from the problem , but I quickly came back to the same consciousness that I say for a lot of money .
But it was such a beautiful place .
Consider how beautiful it is to be in a place where you are totally dependent upon this tiny little brain that keeps you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where I &apos;m doing my work and I &apos;m getting pushed about it .
I felt enormous in my body .
And look at all the relationships that come from the outside world and from that point of view were missing .
And I felt a space of peace and quiet .
And take a look at what it would look like if , instead of lying down , this 13-year-old emotional load you &apos;ve been holding .
( Laughter ) Oh , I sort of made a mess .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain got there , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , wait two .
We need some help , and I think I should be helpful to be proud of this , so I went out of the closet home and I bought myself a makeshift machine , and now I &apos;m putting myself in my apartment , and now I &apos;m thinking , what can I do to drive a car ? And in this moment , my hands have been completely fuzzy .
At that moment , I realized that my God was attacking me , and the only thing my mind tells me is how powerful it is !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who will come up with this opportunity to realize their own brain , and they come from inside — ( Laughter ) — and then one minute come to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very characteristic woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to wave . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; All right , I can &apos;t stop the fighting , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll return to my commute . Okay .
I need to call to help . I need to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job , and then I remembered that I had a business card on my phone number .
I &apos;m in my classroom and I &apos;m bringing out a three-story motorcycle valve .
And I look at the top card , while I can see from my brain &apos;s eyes clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , not because I don &apos;t look at a dot .
And the maps of the words will be helped by the maps and the marks , and I didn &apos;t learn anything .
And then I started waiting for him to tell me what I &apos;m saying .
And at that moment , the public realm repeated itself , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to decrease this graph .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects of falling on the left were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number . I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any path .
So I &apos;m taking the phone and putting it here .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I &apos;m looking at the cards , and I &apos;m looking at the phone and I &apos;m looking at the face of the big bubbles .
But then I switch to my own elbow when I returned , and I didn &apos;t remember putting that number back in .
So I took my fucking hand like a dolphin and I put it on Hindus , and with the other hand , I pressed these buttons that when I came back to the normal truth , I can tell you that I was going to go Hindus first , and I finally got Hindus all over India , and I heard that a gentleman wrote down my phone , and a gentleman wrote me on the phone , and
And I say to her , very clearly in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking to her . I need to help . &quot;
And from my voice , something like &quot; &quot; Woo Woo &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he came to me that I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak a language or understand a language until I tried to speak it .
So he understood that I needed help , and he donated help .
And a little while later , in one ambulance , Sierra Leone was rushing to Boston to another ambulance .
I could get up and look like a baby &apos;s bottom .
Just like the one story that kept falling out of the wall and getting out of the closet , I pulled out the energy and felt my spirit shaking .
And I realized at that moment that I wasn &apos;t prepared for my life .
Or the doctor would save me and give me a second life or give me a second life .
By the time I left , I was surprised enough that I still live .
When I felt the sense of my spirit , I gave life to God .
Now my brain was distorted in two versions of reality .
At that time , the emotion of my emotional system was starting to begin to feel just in the face of pain .
Light shined my brain like the fire in the forest , and the waters were blowing candy and the lights were off because of the background , I didn &apos;t hear a sound , I didn &apos;t hear a voice , I was just speaking to passion .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture , so I felt enormous and wide like a person who had been free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great event that was buried in the ocean of silence .
Great neuron .
I had the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking that this would never happen , that I could find my own great desire to be able to access the inside of a small body .
But that &apos;s when I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought to sleep .
And if I get nervous , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is , it can get nerves , and I &apos;ve seen a world like this that has been fueled by people with beauty , cleanness , compassion and love that they know can someday feel that quality .
And they can pick and choose , the right thing to do is to take a book apart from the left side of their brain and search for this pure quality .
And then I realized how powerful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was the lesson of the visual system that taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After the blood vessels in the south , a pump of blood vessels from my brain was sampled as much as a pump of blood vessel while focusing on the soft-surface capacity of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of quantum life with the skill and two extremely accurate brains .
And we have the power to choose a moment in time in the world where we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can step on the right side of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe , I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful mammalian cells are made of mammalian cells , one that is all there .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual . &quot; &quot; In a deep way .
From the quantum leap , &quot; &quot; he said .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
I think as long as we spend our right-brained time resting the spinal cord of electricity , we &apos;re going to promote peace in the world and our planet will be safe .
And I thought that the idea needed to be resolved .
Thank you .

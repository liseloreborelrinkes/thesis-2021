Good morning !
Are you people staying ?
They picked up my name tags , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Twitter ?
No ! Anybody ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little while ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was trying to eat .
So I wondered , do you have a drink in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he should be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sirt ? ( In English . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Sirt , scream , come on . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; he said .
And he was talking to me , as he was telling himself , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world I will not see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A Japanese teenager made two words and placed a girl in exactly the same sentence as Jill .
How does he speak like this ?
At that moment I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s stopping me from giving my language to my country ?
Where could that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now while we &apos;re here , I &apos;m here as many people as I know , who reach a stage in their life where they rarely leave everything that exists in their history , just because they &apos;re so enjoyable and humiliated .
Should I support my entire culture , my imagination , my security and my imagination ?
We may have the most important battle legislation saved in the story of children .
Would they give me all the things that I learned in Arabic ?
to make them like that ?
Why does this matter ?
However , I tried to understand it .
I wouldn &apos;t want to make as much progress as what he did for me .
Arabic doesn &apos;t require necessity today .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or a study , or a language that we use in universities , a language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we observe when we work on a research curriculum , and it &apos;s not really a language that we use at IDEO .
If we did that , they would follow our script .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we should think about .
Arabic is the mother language .
Research says that you have to force your mother to get the skill in other languages .
In other languages , the main element of the mother is the main element of the mother &apos;s language .
How ?
Jaringan cellar , when he started writing before , became Arabic .
Their whole imagination , their imagination and philosophy were influenced by this young boy at a time when he grew up , feared a special joy , a special voice , and thought about a particular idea .
As soon as they started writing in English , they had more material in them .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their literature in English , you felt that happiness , you felt that same awareness .
So you can imagine that this is their gift in English , this little boy standing in the streets of a little girl standing in a hole in the roof of of Lenin .
So here &apos;s an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact that exists in the developing world .
Germany , France , Japan and China all have those things .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this developed mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to reach this developing world .
They were countries like ours in the past , but they decided to try to rise , study , and travel to these countries , such as land , employment , etc . , and they traveled with their languages as they moved to the schools . Like Yoda .
They kept her close .
Because if you go to a farmer or a farmer or a farmer and you don &apos;t write on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be involved in these unprecedented markets , like us , more time .
So in order to create new inventions and new facilities , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Hi , selfish , Arabic , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you of ?
What would you understand ?
Who , how and where .
Languages are not just about the conversation , only the words are coming at us .
Language is a sign of our lives , and the phrases that separate us from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Self-consciousness , self-sufficiency , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special place in your brains . Every single emotion has a special kind of historic moment for a particular day .
Language is not about bringing one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that depends on our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our message ?
How would you say you didn &apos;t understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the Freedom of English ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , then I better go and spend a lot of time talking about consumption .
The point is that these influences remind us of a particular thing .
I have a friend , a French speaker , who &apos;s a French speaker .
He was asking for a while .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I tried to swallow her and translate it one night to try and translate what she meant to be &quot; &quot; compelling . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Millennium Magnetic called her &quot; &quot; compelling , &quot; &quot; and then spent the night trying to understand her .
He wondered , how can somebody really be that smart ?
Do they want to self-organize ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us realize that she didn &apos;t understand the word , because she couldn &apos;t understand , and she was right ; she had a different way of thinking about it .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he calls me FedEx , and one night , I tried to translate to him so that he could feel what I feel when I hear February . &quot; &quot; An image woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have left her hand and why you have . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the reason is , because you &apos;re me , I put my hand and I left you . &quot; (
He translates it . He shows me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to break the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started an Arabic language protector .
While lots of people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Whatever the hell is in front of you , go ahead and say , &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protector won a phrase , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You spoke in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do that because , you know , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if someone says to me , I &apos;m not bored from Arabic .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be responsible in the way we dream , our desires and our daily lives .
The letter looks like us and the way we think .
So this quote , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from east , but you answer the West . &quot; &quot; Get the right shows .
It &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s fun and efficient .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on Earth .
You just saw one example outside of it , a context with a letter in black and blue on top of a tap , with the translation , &quot; Language kill . &quot;
Why ? Actually , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we killed our language , we should have a distinct melody for ourselves .
We have to find a way to be .
We have to get back to the beginning .
And this crisis is too expensive for the opportunity to create modernity and religion .
After this , we took pictures of boys and girls who were already in Arabic .
These are pictures of boys and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Oh ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve spelled the word &quot; &quot; Cocola . &quot; &quot; They want to make the point , but I &apos;ve got a word that &apos;s great and that &apos;s the same thing .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; The Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not mosquitos ! We shouldn &apos;t hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be convinced that we &apos;re not going to let anybody make a claim , or that we &apos;re going to have a choice in our language , we &apos;re going to press on , or we &apos;re going to have to engage our people and think .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the ground or not refine the rocket or something , we can be creative again .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in the mother tongue .
Let &apos;s start with this day .
They write a nation or make a short film .
Once upon a time , we can actually roll out a global scale .
He can repeatedly translate the Arabic text to the front lines .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there is no solution ; there is a solution .
But we have to know this , and we have to be convinced that the solution is there , we have to be part of the solution .
By the way , what can you do today ?
How many of you are Twitter ?
In Arabic , I urge you , though , my time has finished , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin word !
( Applause ) That &apos;s silly ! That &apos;s not a language .
You enter a magical world with a language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;ve come here to enjoy the need for language conservation .
Now let me tell you a secret .
A child encounters his father &apos;s most famous language for the first time .
When my daughter was born , I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , Hi . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , and I picked up my daughter &apos;s light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks Arabic . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , Thanks , Mom , don &apos;t listen .
And don &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of copy . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it so that we remember the deepest mystery that our present situation is not a miracle , it &apos;s a parody of the parties that are poisoning to my people , even when you saw my generation not chosen to check our balance of inequality , and when it comes to our generation , it doesn &apos;t even rank our generation when it comes to dictators that
( Applause )
I love chocolate data .
In college , I had a theme song , which meant I had a lot of writing records .
Now a regular person , when something writes , has something to do with it .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re starting to slow down , but the first week you do more work and more work , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;d like to do that too .
Here &apos;s my approach .
My office follows everything , but actually the teacher will get to the top , and then I will do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with every teacher .
And then came along a new paper , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my common denial was not good enough to pay for this type of status .
It was a huge task .
I proposed a plan , and I decided that I would do something like this .
This year , something like this will happen .
I &apos;m going to start with a little task , in the middle months , I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
He comes and goes , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we rebuilt a great project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then he would go off to sleep , and I wasn &apos;t writing anything , and we were doing something .
And two weeks went by , which was two weeks .
And then I went away one day , and I spent three days in the Dead Line , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I wrote down 90 pages , I did two streets , and I did — people don &apos;t have to go on two streets — check the boxes , check the boxes , check the boxes , check the
I thought , well , it &apos;s over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you running from there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk about your issue . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , from now on , it &apos;s perfect . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t even sure . ( Laughter )
He was too busy . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited from that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re so good .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about content .
My Ranger regularly puts chest pain on me , and I wanted to tell the chest people what &apos;s going on in the human brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain makes a difference between the senior people .
To find out that I made a leaf where I could diagnose two brains of either hemispheres and diagnose the brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look very carefully and say , there has been a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but consider this .
So here &apos;s a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s different .
There are hundreds of thousands of decisions in both brains , but saddle-like human brains are found to be quite entertaining .
Now what does this mean in terms of a staircase ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; It &apos;s time for the purpose of work . &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; Hundreds of people make decisions in order to make sense , but fundamentally they don &apos;t like the plan , so they take the word , and they say , &quot; &quot; Look , don &apos;t read the chocolate page , &quot; &quot; and write the chocolate secret , because I know it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go to the pub . And see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After this , you &apos;ll see it on YouTube , beginning with a talk about the TED conference , and very soon after it &apos;s done to watch the TV show from the mother of Tibet .
( Laughter ) It would take a little while on all of those things , so it wouldn &apos;t take much time to do anything with it today .
How would that be ? ( SM : Now , what &apos;s happening here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the foundation of happiness that you want to give .
It just needs to be in the present .
The future has no vision of the future , but it &apos;s only two things : philanthropy and love .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all well .
If you can and you spend your entire life going forward , you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And basically , human animals are a generation .
Good food , good nutrition , and increased generation , maybe farmers would go like this .
But if you haven &apos;t looked , it &apos;s not that far off .
We &apos;re an increasingly educated species , and we don &apos;t even know .
That &apos;s why we have another person in our brain , decisions minds , who can make us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we need to do is eat what makes us happy .
Sometimes a coach seems as though doing what is easily and enjoyable as eating , sleep or enjoyable from the moment of opportunity .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a shame .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do that , which is difficult .
And this is a terrible bonus .
And for the rest of the audience , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends a lot of time in the quiet , simple and mysterious way that for centuries it &apos;s gone beyond .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) The dark net is the place where the rest of the people are familiar with .
There &apos;s an age when generosity shouldn &apos;t be a leader .
In the dark areas that most of you know about , it &apos;s not actually any more , because it &apos;s not just your right , space , crime , fear , shame , and self-indulgence — all the properties that go along in the right order .
The question is , in this case , when the baseline is driven , how do the rest of us rise to billions of suns , which is a lesser but important place ?
It turns out that Sebastian also has a security guarantee , which always protects him in his dark spaces — somebody mentioned the household .
( Laughter ) Now this is a house which is more popular , but when the Death Valley comes closer , it becomes thinkable , or at the moment when people are at risk of embarrassment , of employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that it just flows through this .
Now I was born with a relationship with my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and asked me to TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was to participate in TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my joy and passion , something else was happening in the brain of making decisions long .
He was saying , &quot; Do you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start now . The principal said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I agree . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you go to Google and look at the map of India at less than 200 feet , we &apos;ll just break it down until we see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So this day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED decided they wanted to give the jar of candor .
I downloaded the Web and had a picture of me holding it .
And who worried ?
( Laughter ) The house was under control , and within seconds the entire system was under threat . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared to the house — he was fine to go to the tree !
And finally , at the end of the work , hundreds of decision-makers came together and I can start a conversation .
Now , the House that talks about is going to give every kind of creative block , somehow someone like me would give two weeks to a piece of paper and not write a piece of paper , and then incredibly , incredibly lets unbelievable letters go to sleep every night and write a piece of paper .
And three key ingredients in this case — stereotyped people .
That &apos;s great , so it &apos;s not easy to train .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was amazed at the impact on it .
I actually got thousands of miles from around the world and from people , who were full of different types of aging .
They included nuns , bankers , engineers , petitors and even ACEs .
( Laughter ) And almost the same story and the same article was , &quot; I &apos;m also concerned with this problem . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and various IMs .
People &apos;s scripts were making myos about how much SOLEs did in their lives , based on what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the next ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
It turns out that there are two basic types of errors .
I gave you a couple of examples today , talking about subjects , all of them were the data set .
And when the Death Valley is online , the effects of presentation are dead because of the housing that comes .
But Saint has a second dimension , and it &apos;s not about any DNA link .
So if you want a career to start yourself like some arts or businesses — some kind of arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start teaching yourself to read quickly , to do things .
In addition to doing things that no longer have to do with data , things like travel with your family , exercise , think about your health , think about your relationships , tell your relationships better than what you don &apos;t expect .
Now if the only way to work is through SOLEs , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data sets up in the context of the home that &apos;s missing .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The good news is that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of long tradition that tends to look at much less and less about less , rather than the dead , consistent primary attributes .
You are suffering from injury and injury .
And this can be the source of long-term loyalty .
So I thought that was the reason they had email , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the winter .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
Tel Mitchell saw her , in her own life , at times .
The anxiety is not that they cannot fulfill their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails and there was one obvious thing — I think there are no heavy people .
I think you &apos;re all human .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And probably some of you in the audience have good relationships , but memory activities don &apos;t exist when there &apos;s a Death Valley .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the lifeblood calendar .
Each block means one week , it &apos;s in the new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them are .
I think we all need to go beyond this Canada .
We need to think about what jobs we &apos;re doing , because no one in every single life is failing at all .
We need to be very careful .
It &apos;s essential to all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that same house on it , and maybe we should start right now .
Probably not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .

On that day , a document from the United States and Afghanistan , an accent of the United States and Afghanistan was covering an area of Afghanistan , moving out of a region of Afghanistan to support an official operation in Afghanistan to help him save an Afghan office to help him save an official jobs so that an Afghan government could help him save an Afghan office to help him save the jobs of the Afghan government , and
The military literature came in at the height of an assault , and they were surrounded by three and a lot of things , and along came the Cape Twin Children , and you were seen as a child by the Cape Twin Swiss , and you watched as a child by the way to save and save lives .
One of her kids , one of her kids , and she and a Spanish doctor , were growing up towards a Hillel cafeteria and she was growing up with a Hillel carpet for a Spanish document .
This shows that the clearance of Cape Sweden and her intestine takes the temperature of Gulf .
They put it into a helicopter , and then you see what the Kepton Susson can do before they can save others .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? It &apos;s a very deep emotion when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love and I knew why it &apos;s the way I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , in the footprint , you &apos;re given the people who want to vote for themselves in order to benefit other people .
In business , we give bonuses to people who want to hire other people to help us .
We have an Italian number !
So I asked myself , where did people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they tip the iceberg .
Those are better people to move beyond the notion of services , and those are better people to move beyond the notion of services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is a environment , and if you have a dedicated environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so each of us has the ability to work together and build on it and build on it that &apos;s within others .
I &apos;ve got a great privilege to meet with some of these people , and we &apos;re going to call Madhav the morning , and I &apos;ve got a great privilege to meet with some of these people yesterday , who said yesterday , they put your soul and their confidence in order to save other people , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do that ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing , &quot; Because they did it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The hard thing to think about trust and collaboration is that it &apos;s not just emotions .
It &apos;s not possible for any of you to &quot; &quot; throw me off , &quot; &quot; and you do .
It &apos;s not possible that I put two people together and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this excitement come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , to the very beginning of Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , all of those talks are deeply focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Allowance can be a resource deficit , but as a team has been working together to mitigate all this and to mitigate the duration of our lives , it &apos;s all working together to mitigate the duration of our lives .
And so we were ready in the social animals that we &apos;re bringing together and working together as part of what I call a personality trait , as in a community where we felt our own personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was fun and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can sleep at night and I can scroll around and see the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t run from each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t run from you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by the dangers of things that are struggling to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
This could be a market driver . It could be a market driver .
It could be a new technology that &apos;s going to disrupt your business crash overnight ; it could be a new technology that &apos;s going to disrupt your business crash overnight .
Or you can fight , which sometimes makes you worry .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but it at least drives your development and tries to run your businesses around trying to lead you , it hurts your livelihood and tries to steal your businesses away from you .
We don &apos;t have any authority on these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never be done .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is done , because that &apos;s where the leadership is .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in his organization and their lives , to protect the people in his organization and protect the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to cover their peace and loyalty results so that people can experience their peace and loyalty results so that people can feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , the values that they have .
I was on a journey journey , and I noticed a truth that when a journey tried to go on a journey before it was laid out and I saw clients on the doorway that they would come to this man just like he passed the law as he was crying .
A rebus just before he tried to walk in , a time before he had tried to walk in .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you calling us a fish like this ?
Why can &apos;t you sit down with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer back then .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we like to travel with our West Virlins is not because they respect Muslim people better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t fall out of their leaders .
See , if conditions are abundant , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and it shrills the organization .
What is a great leader for her , the nearest example I can show is how to become a parent is a good one for her , and the nearest example I can show is how to become a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what do you want ? What builds a good parent ?
We want to give our kids opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give our kids opportunities , education , theory and record , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give them the chance to grow up and do more of what we can do for ourselves to grow up and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Well , that &apos;s exactly what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people the opportunity , education , discipline , whatever it is they need , they want to give them the chance to be trustworthy , access to more opportunities that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more of what we &apos;ve imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the Next Jump in New York City , CEO of a tech company called Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the Next Jump in New York City , CEO of a tech company , and they said , &quot; &quot; If your family has a tough time , will you ever open your child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?

If you &apos;re working in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of elections .
Instead , if you have a problem , they will lead you and help you , just like we would do to a kid who comes home from school and gives you a C route .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are starting CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are starting CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the clients are starting to get to the CEO , some of them being mostly lonely and depressed .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the basic principle of dignity .
They &apos;ve grown a dense society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones by the children of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones by the children of their loved ones , but rather that they have honored their loved ones by the children of their loved ones , and rather than that they have guaranteed their loved ones for their own children .
That &apos;s what compares to us , not data .
Can anyone guess why it &apos;s worth 150 million dollars to spend ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not .
Great Leaders will never present people &apos;s data to save .
Great Leaders will never present people &apos;s data to save .
Instead , they will give people rapid data to save , but they will give people rapid data to save .
Bob Sheptz , who runs a mining company in the Manhattan district , goes to a media company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and he volunteered a brilliant business and drove himself 30 percent overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem and they can &apos;t really afford to buy a budget of their shoes anymore .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , and so many of today &apos;s companies have joined the board and they have joined it .
And Bob did .
See , the bow doesn &apos;t trust the dragonflies .
Instead of believing in the cheating of the poor , and reducing the poor , it &apos;s harder to reduce the poor , and reduce the poor . It &apos;s harder to reduce the poor .
And then they built a self-organizing program .
That every employee , from the Critic to the CEO , should have everyone in the small four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted it and didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Boob posted a program , he stays very important .
He said that it &apos;s better that all of us , instead of taking small doses of danger , some of us , get a lot more damage and get a lot more excited .
They have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as people expect , when they feel secure from an organization , trust and collaboration is natural .
And basically , just like no one expected , people started businesses with each other .
The ones that did the most were the ones who did the least productive business .
So some people have given five hives to each other in three hives .
Values are a gift , not a gift .
I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the most well-meaning of organizations , and I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the most well-meaning of organizations who are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re good citizens , and we do what they say , because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t track them .
And I know a lot of people around the corner of the organization who have no authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve looked at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had a dedicated look at the person on the left , and they &apos;ve looked at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve looked at the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some scientists that went out in the theater and just like the way the scientists work is that the guy takes the courage and he takes his uniform off before he eats , and he doesn &apos;t save anything for him .
And when he came back into the field , his customers gave him some of his lunch so he could eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them that they do it .
We call them leaders because they take dangerous assets first , and we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and we call them the leaders because they choose to be the victims so that their people can be safe and so that their contributions , and when we do that , natural selection is that our people cherish our people .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and pink and robust so that they can see the dreams of their leaders becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and pink and blue to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all said the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us too . &quot; &quot; And aren &apos;t the organizations that we would like to work for ?
And aren &apos;t the organizations for which we all like to work , and aren &apos;t the organizations that we &apos;re all going to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story about the Limpopo , which is the size of Limpopo and Mpumbai .
Where the water supply and electricity are really irrational , like mold , and in these conditions it &apos;s very difficult to grow at the age of 17 , I was staying still with friends in the bathroom with friends in the bathroom .
The temperature of the ammonia is extremely hot .
And as I was filling out the door , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you invent something that doesn &apos;t just touch your skin ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this thing ? &quot; &quot; And I went home and I did some research and I had some amazing statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and protection .
Forty-three of them are in 40 million , and there are only South Africa .
Different diseases contain hemispheres , and one of the most dangerous things is called atrazine .
A reflex that occurs from seeing the naked eye is an inflation that &apos;s more than one of the transmitters that you can instantly pick up .
This disease consistently inspires eight million people every year , and most of the reason for that is because you only have to give up your pension to save the tragedy : no finish , no farmers , no engineering .
After I looked at the profile , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I went to my brother 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have any laptops , I didn &apos;t have any Internet , I went to Google , did some research on Wikipedia , did some research on Wikipedia , and then I went
And looking at this as a profound problem .
So Mahammad said it was right , and our family was ready .
Now we need to be careful .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on the phone , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent Holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; now and no more ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mystery exchange .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a pencil .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and fine-tuning resources , which I had , the Mediterranean Mediterranean Index brought in some new people , did this additional process , and now we have an utterly immersive curriculum , which is ready to buy the market , is now available .
We learned some lessons from doodles to commercials and people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They just buy a license plate protected by someone who doesn &apos;t buy a license plate in Alex . They buy a license plate protected , because it makes them more tangible .
So we put DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just pick it up and leave it outside .
And the great thing is , a typical slum is replaced only in five circles .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about the efficiency of manufacturing .
We even need DriBath on average a weekly basis .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water every time they leave , and we could save two houses for children who live in the same neighborhood , two hours for school , more than two hours for hives of drought . Two more houses for children .
After watching global impacts , we took that from our main values of values , health and culture .
DriBath is a rich man and a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually entering a process by which we can sell it to a multinational brand that can be put into the retail market , and a question I &apos;m going to ask you to consider today , on the cutting of the Limpopo Canyon , with one of the 50 walls of an onion in a week , came up with a way to save the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done that yet . I haven &apos;t done that yet .
And one more important thing is that I learned a lot from this period of time , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s greatest youth .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that has access to accounting , and one thing that surprised me , however , is why I didn &apos;t want to judge it all . Thank you .
( Applause )
More importantly , I &apos;m presenting to you today some of the discoveries that surprised me , and I was also surprised by what are the real reasons for the success of companies — which are , in fact , the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you select a group of people with the desire for equality and organize them in the beginning , you will find the human endeavor that was never possible before .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But if initial businesses are so good , why do most of the failures occur ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know when things are the most important thing for success in the beginning .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , cutting a lot of false ideas and false ideas that came from some of the other organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I &apos;m building different businesses from the age of 12 , from the age of 12 , from New Jersey High School , from Kanda to kindergarten to high school , when I was building solar power tools , then to school , when I was making laptops .
I graduated from college , and I started a foundation for software .
And 20 years ago , the Indus script started , over the last 20 years , and we &apos;ve launched over 100 companies , many successes , many major breakthroughs .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to be an astronomer on those factors to tell you the success of an organization or the greatest cause of failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
So I took the name of my company , Deep Blue , the last moment you feel about any idea .
With reflection , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to move forward or backward , is even more critical .
I never thought that I &apos;d be speaking to a TEDster , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , until I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
The ability to organize a team to move past coast is critical .
Cookie is an honest fact .
So I thought , well , maybe the team has the ultimate value .
So I started looking at business models .
Is it something that &apos;s obvious about supply ?
With that in mind , it seemed to be the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
Sure . Is it the right time ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s slow , so you &apos;re coming and you &apos;re going to teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or was it too late , and I was already so frightened ?
So I took a lot of respect for these five factors and I went to many companies .
And IDEO has formed 100 Libra companies , and 100 of them outside to try and find a scientific result .
So first of these ideas , for the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Good , NetZero , Tickets.com — they &apos;re all dollars of revenue .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com. , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we were hopeful , but failed .
And then I tried to follow all of these qualities , as I think these companies had promised over these places .
And then in leopard seals from outside , I saw strange adventures like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz , and Frindster .
Next companies had big investments , and they &apos;d never had a business model , but they weren &apos;t going to be successful .
I tried to figure out , but the highest impact of all these companies was in success and failure , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was time .
Right now , there &apos;s a 42 percent chance of making the difference between success and failure .
The view of team and spouse is on the other hand , and then , thinking differently , being identical , is actually a third number .
But it &apos;s not really clear , not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but when I looked at it and I realized that ideas didn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my mind .
I think the market model is still very quiet because you can start without a market model later , when you grow up in coffee houses , include it .
And investment , if initially low investment , but now it &apos;s rising , particularly today , is very easy to get investment .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of those noes .
Take a big success on Airbnb , which you all know .
The company noticed a lot of investors because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to get a piece of your house ? &quot;
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of Mgras is that the best market model , the workplace , and the warning dashboard , is the right time .
This company came in front of obstacles when people needed additional support , and surely to help people react to the proposal that they needed at home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came to me , the best company , the best business model , the best employees .
But time was absolutely right , making the definitions they needed .
Dreaders were aspiring for additional education ; it was absolutely critical .
Some adventures , like Citysearch , came when people needed Wikipedia .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies were looking for more disclosure .
We thought the idea was perfect , but in fact , the right time was probably more needed .
And then something failed .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment firm .
We were so focused on it — so we had to work with big businesses , with some really cool examples , with some great entrepreneurs from Halewd .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband band network was much smaller .
The online video was so difficult , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your broker , you didn &apos;t know what to do , and eventually this company arrived in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem was solved by Adobe Flash and broadband in the United States , more than 50 percent were left , YouTube was at the best .
Great idea , the best of times .
It turns out that YouTube , when it started , was no commercial example .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was the ultimate choice .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
An idea is critical .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if you really are willing to act on your own .
And the real security thing is , the outcome doesn &apos;t come out of it , because if something interests you , you want to keep it in the future , but in terms of time frame , you have to work incredibly safe .
As it used to be , early companies can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of those conversations will help you grow your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best community .

&#91; 3 a.m. on September 2016 we saw the biggest data set in history . &#93; &#91; Finance accents debated rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; A recent money station in a non-market . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve done it to erase the traffic of the Galapagos Venture . &#93; &#91; A recruitment center of the week that brought back the National Institute of
From the French , whose contributions have been made to discover small secret weapon firms .
We get to the kitchen , the bankers and the inner stories of the village who come to us with these cushions and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a family company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You actually get to see the email , you can see the exchange of messages , you can see a way to do it , how they do it .
The effects of that have just started to manifest .
The prime minister of Austria is extremely famous .
We also heard about workshops like crash test drivers .
The revenue of the two billion dollars goes to the main source of the Red Lock market towards its child companion , which is the famous Sistine .
And many brilliant people will be paralyzed , and those who will tell the story will be the further hidden documents , the more likely they will be home .
Now this tells a story of a magic film , or a song of a violin that I love .
What should we do with it ?
But the truth is that the generous and the powerful people sit in the seat on their lawns , and the more taxes they shouldn &apos;t be giving , the meaning is that fetal actions like battles have lower health and education .
And the effect of that is on all of us .
For my organization , for global warming , it &apos;s amazing .
Global media and political leadership are talking about how people in lobbyists handle their influence — which we &apos;ve been talking about for decades .
I think this is because , in a way , the world is open , and it &apos;s very difficult to understand how these markets work .
I think it &apos;s like Russian girls .
You can go to another company within a company , a company inside a company , almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind it .
Companies for Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure Disclosure
I also think it &apos;s interesting that the U.S. hasn &apos;t talked about it so much .
Probably because Americans don &apos;t have to be in this room .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States .
It &apos;s because of the way the road companies work , there are just a few of them in the U.S.
I think if we read the manufacturing of Kman Illinand , or Del Walter , or Wei , or Meyerowitz , then the way we communicate comes from America .
Instead of giving a lot of Americans not enough information , you have less information to make yourself a company than you do with a leverage card .
In American schools , this kind of information is sent to students through hidden information .
Nine veterans funded it very easily .
The role of this kind affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to look at what this problem looks like .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we hooked up a tour and we sent 13-year-olds to Manhattan .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transfer that village across the United States to a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The heartbreaking thing was that all the villages had provided a single platform for how the coal can move .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make any money for him , and we didn &apos;t pay anybody , but this was how the system crashed .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about individual voices that talked about our hidden experiences and proposals .
It &apos;s not just about a politician who &apos;s been trained in Singapore .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which tackles radiation , values , poverty and inability .
And to be able to do that , we have to change that game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that the game can be daunting in the wrong way .
It can be awkward , as long as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , as rich and powerful people are always .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve gone on to being transparent where the company talks about power .
The issue was launched on political Isaac , but the British Prime Minister Department of Defense Department of Defense inspired 8 statements that were happening in southern Finland in 2013 .
And from then on , the European Union is building a downtown keyboard , which is basically a country of which companies are or controlling them .
The sad thing is that the U.S. is behind this .
Difference in the map of a given legal scheme in the center and the Senate , where the improvement we wanted was not high , so we were finished .
We want to look at inventions , large-scale businesses , used around the world and around the U.S.
This is a moment of change in the Gulf Ventures .
People have to come to grips with fear for their loved ones behind barbed wires . Greek leaders .
Hopefully , they speak up , it &apos;s not good for this kind of privilege , we have .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to lobby for change in transparent information .
We can aggregate the privilege of bringing together a section that is responsible for the cab and the cold chain .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that the Lexus , your invention , has opened up more and more sensational documents in the last few years than any other media in the world .
Can it happen ?
Julie Sager : Yeah , can it be true ?
This is a paragraph — what isn &apos;t it ? — that the media around the world is showing a level of negative action that &apos;s effectively being able to share a small group of employees in this kind of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How did that happen ?
How do people organize ?
And how do you stay passionate ?
Julie Sager : Yeah , so these are — I can tell you — in the right way , public service . And we have a lot of ways to get this information to us .
So we use a lot of high-water reserves to ship materials from one place to the Internet , shows how to handle clean neighborhoods like Sweden and Bill &apos;s .
We get information credit scores , through public debt , through Ramma Shaheen or whatever , they organize it like public news organizations , format — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive amounts of information for people , and then protect yourself against the oppressed legal and political officials .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the documents are real , but you don &apos;t really know what the tools are .
Julian Sager : This is right , where we &apos;re going to get this knowledge all the time . And if we &apos;re going to get to a point , we quickly extract information .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Choose &#93; God will call it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s crazy to see what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we could look at it .
So this was a story about Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you sponsored and then what happened ?
Julie Sager : Yeah , so it &apos;s a chocolate report .
It was a secret legal report that the government of Kenya prepared after the elections in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had been there for 18 years .
He was a nomad in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of Cuba — based on the priority efforts , who tried to run from Kenya — they put 20 million pounds of report card onto the report card and on one report card .
And then the government was sitting at it and using it to counter their political will , which was the wealthiest man — now is the wealthiest man in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ for the president of Kenya .
So it was taken in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this just before December 2008 .
When we did that report , three days after we did that , Kobe decided to become friends with the person he was sitting next to , Daniel Armstrong , so he opened the report card and he stood in front of the city .
CA : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , not to say that — this was spread in Kenya , not from the provincial council , but from the mean , and it changed the game in your head .
Julian Sangling : Yeah . It was the joke in Guardian , and then it happened all over the world in Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he , after a few instances , convinced the Kenyan press to talk about it .
And this blog was run on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed 10 percent of the citizens , according to one online sex report in Kenya , and it changed the outcome of elections .
CA : Wow . So how did your insights really change the world ?
JL : Yes !
( Applause ) CA : There we go . We &apos;re going to show a little clip of a wing-beat video .
This video is live but here &apos;s a little clip of something .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a heart attack video .
RG : ... It hurts , when you reach them , and you steal them .
I realized , oh , there are four with them .
The truth is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your reserve , tell me to go .
Have a dollar .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Machine noises ) Galen is running .
Hatel — six Master , two six Master .
We need to go now , time is up !
Okay , we killed eight people now .
Here we &apos;re looking at two old Hilly Kapter , and we &apos;re still operating on flowers .
RG : They &apos;re on my feet .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re on our way .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God beat you , Hi . All right . Yeah , I took them off .
CA : So what did that mean ?
Julian Sangling : People who worked on it had a profound impact on it .
We ended up surveying two people a little bit more .
It was the first in three places that happened .
CA : So 11 people in this situation , right ?
Julian Sangling : Yeah ! Two employees in the Reports , two little kids were lost .
In total , 18 to 26 people have died .
CA : And after his execution , he went mad .
What was the key reason he got distracted , you know ?
Julian Sager : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as being utterly unbalanced by power .
On the one hand , some people are going to the grass , and then one kilometer away , the alcoholic Gulf Keater begins to scroll 30 miles from each other — any by far — and enhances the atrocities by infants .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t very busy , because their profession was so precise .
CA : Well , the United States Department of Defense arrested Broadmining , and it says that he announced in Rome that he did this video to you over 280,000 and a half American documents as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Sager : So we &apos;ve dealt with acceptance .
Five days ago , it was clear that 150,000 documents and 50 officials were received .
But now we did that in the beginning of the year in Rajasthan and an American safari family , but there is no correlation .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of dispatches in the United States .
Julie Sager : We will be giving them a play . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do it ? ) JH : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) JL : Because these things show that actually , right now , what Arab governments are going to do is fight human rights in these governments .
If you look at the fossil record , it &apos;s in the material itself .
CA : Don &apos;t listen to him .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you create information that is hidden ?
Julian Sager : Yes , the question is how important information the world is , what information can be turned off .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out there , when companies know it better , and they know the story about it , they also care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of press .
CA : But is it safe to individually or collectively lead to a broader society , where innovation is unexpected ?
Julian Sanging : We did not do what exists with them .
I mean our big challenge is responsible .
With information , we &apos;re able to gather in a very personalized way the information that &apos;s available — the information that &apos;s available to someone else .
But there are also paradox . For example , your doctor has your data ; it &apos;s a miracle channel — but we &apos;re talking about public goods that come in and out of play .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re pretty excited about it .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , the father of someone whose daughter is a U.S. lieutenant , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve done something so effectively that some people like to hug other people .
Here &apos;s an American philosophy of the dead .
And this influence — but it has shown millions of people all over the world that the United States is political .
While they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , &quot; &quot; Who would you say ? &quot; &quot; So what would you answer ?
Julie Sager : Yeah , we &apos;re asking a lot of questions like this .
But remember in the taboo , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , so they &apos;re insane .
It doesn &apos;t matter what their opinions are , it doesn &apos;t matter what their opinions are .
Because the Koran is looking at all of this .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and their thinking that gives them money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re looking for hope in what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous if you didn &apos;t think that in order to have this light , you really have to be able to have that kind of privacy in your mind ?
Julian Sager : Not at all . I mean , we &apos;re not at all different places .
We don &apos;t have the kind of information that &apos;s surrounded by other minds .
If they do this , it will be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically comfortable doing it , that they &apos;re not going to grow up doing it later .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , what we did — I was just fascinated by this incredible thing .
You can also imagine that there are different breakthroughs about the lions and the lions .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or perhaps it &apos;s a problem .
What is the view of Jerusalem ?
And what are the problems ?
Julie Sager : Oh ! Something should be happening .
CA : These are great people , Julie , brilliant .
We have to try and do . Today they show another example .
Here &apos;s something you haven &apos;t even heard of yet , but I think you &apos;ve been paying attention to TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is a little bit more ancient , isn &apos;t it ?
What is that ?
Julie Sager : This is an example of what we do nearly every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — we &apos;ve been sitting in the banks of many important areas in November , like the Gulf in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had the report card — which was a very good experiment about it — where it was said that actually protecting veterans from different types of oil companies , they put tracers in there and they let them go .
And there were some brilliant government contractors , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing on that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t compare it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were pretty surprised that maybe this was a company that did all of this in a competitive game .
At the foundation we put it on , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t make a guess about it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the same week that he wrote , he wanted to take a paper route . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to write the paper . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , let &apos;s talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how much money do you have for sure ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they took this lead that we see on Scripture with the name of French , the microphone company .
Yeah .
( Applause ) There &apos;s been many times .
It &apos;s a way of measuring and identifying what the material is , and that &apos;s what these people are trying to write and get .
CA : OK . Have you ever submitted this information to BMW ?
Julian Sager : Yeah , we have so much , I mean , at the moment , we collect and measure variables that go beyond the hard stages .
So our petition of publishing has gotten equal in a few months because we &apos;re refining our buy system better because of the rare public waste that we have .
This is the spring .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s flourishing , more than our capacity is deeply connected to us because of our growth , and that means that we have public goods in large numbers of public goods , but we don &apos;t have people who can quantify and quantify this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , how much would a journalist or a journalist want ?
Julie Sager : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to resolve fast-forward , because we have to organize with the material we have to deal with , so we have to recruit people that we have to work with very , very sensitive materials of public safety , and then we have to get to the very least .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re telling us a little bit about your own work and how you got to that work .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that true ?
Julian Sangling : Yeah , my parents were in the movies business and then walking out of the city , so the effect was both of those things .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychiatrist , so what this means is that everything together can be invented just by emotion .
( Applause ) Jennifer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a little bit of a hero at the age of a job , and you came up with ideas of success .
Julie Sager : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I told the girl at the time that when she got mad at me in that crime .
So you have to appreciate the word &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; in order to understand the word .
I mean , there &apos;s a way — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only used by Russian women to cover the banks of your grandmother .
So this word , it &apos;s not very helpful anymore .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that your grandmother is a banker , but what do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps an event in your life that helped them do ?
JL : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic values : good , productive and productive people do not produce meat ; they prepare it .
And that &apos;s the lesson that I learned from my father and some of the most brilliant and brilliant people that live in my life .
CA : And brilliant and highly productive people don &apos;t produce products for their products ?
Julian Sager : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed guy , so I &apos;m not that good at adult development , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of adding a meadow , which is approaching the police department .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : So we just had to end with just this last moment : What happened in Iceland ?
Basically , you did something here , which was a problem with a banker , and then they gave the newspaper a little warning about the situation that they had .
Instead , they inspired your situation .
So you &apos;re pretty famous in the &apos; 80s . So what happened ?
Julie Sager : Yeah , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
NASA has gone through a social crisis .
She was the most heroic .
The bubbles here had gone up 10 times the size of the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year .
And the permanent pregnancy that happened five minutes before she was published , like a movie : &quot; Unfortunately she got on the news , and the state of the nurse was , &quot; That &apos;s never happened to us . What are we going to do ? &quot;
So we just showed up the website , time-consuming , and we &apos;re getting so famous in Iceland , I went to Iceland and and talked about this issue .
And the elements for the people there were things that shouldn &apos;t happen again , and as a result , the audience here in Iceland , working with some other international experts , we lobbied for a new type of Iceland law , so this is like a Freedom Media , the most protected area for journalists all over the world , bringing about new Nobel Prize .
A nation like Ice Land this is like a nation , which means it &apos;s moving up from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Icelandic Parliament perfected this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look towards the future , do you realize that the more expected it is to show power and power , the more polarized , or are we looking at us with power , or is it going to be the most exciting ?
Julie Sager : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure on the law of liberty and the law of transparency , globally — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What crash would it take ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so it &apos;s a very interesting time to live — because with a small effort , we can move from one side to the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating some of the passionate speakers here into something called Julian , validating , and all the power comes from you .
Julie Sager : Thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was completely involved in cooking .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is a multimedia-tasker .
I used to run my childhood echoes around the kitchen and see these mosquitos running around .
When I was growing up and going back home in the &apos; 90s , I had this dream .
My team was a challenge .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mouse , I suddenly realized how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the Middle East , wherever I &apos;d gone , surprised that North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or the city of London , repeatedly seemed to see all four animals being slaughtered by Nineteen — slumber , timber and code .
And I thought that was kind of peculiar , and I was wondering if anybody else had the touch of this complicated model .
And when I went to visit him , I realized that people don &apos;t look at the career team .
Ordinary people look at something like this .
To confine the natural world with a few elements , there is no unusual human characteristics .
We did that 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the arrowheads 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see that you look at the arrowheads and the arrowheads of all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : red , blue , blue and blue .
It &apos;s also true for adults .
So if you look at Mony about 150 or 200 years ago , on the streets of New York City , you &apos;re going to see cars , flowers and flowers .
But if you look far from the present , you &apos;re going to see just four paragraphs — the train , the dog , but the race .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving this way .
How did that happen to us ?
Sir .
It &apos;s a brand new problem .
In the last 50 years we &apos;ve been fighting this way .
The second great battle has given us the greatest inspiration to become Batman .
During World War II , we added technology to the mountains , the mountains , the mountains , and things like that , to the mountains .
And since the end of World War II , we have seen the tremendous increase in the capacity for meat management .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that military farming and sea urchins have grown increasing , after a couple of years , their income has increased greater than total mass .
Now if you collect forest pollution and forest pollution , it &apos;s about two Chinese equivalents every year from sea level .
Using my Chinese carpet example is not a contradiction , because China is not only one of the largest emitters , it &apos;s also the largest emitters .
Let &apos;s now turn to our elected officials .
First of all , the majority of all pesticides in the United States and the West are wasteful .
Forestry leaks extremely bad .
There &apos;s only one drop of forest gills five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest gills to market .
Language is an incredibly cool way to get to the market .
In a study done in a study done in the Dutch University , it proved that reading gasoline from gas is absolutely ineffective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the ranks of the jungle in areas in the woods are the mangroves .
Now look at these beautiful bats .
It clears the death of the earth from its spaces , protects the beaches , livestock and pets , and all sorts of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the forests of Mongolia .
We spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of coastal plants .
There &apos;s a second operation that &apos;s happening here , which is what the philosopher Marine Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; the Nakuru Child . &quot; &quot; And you just saw a little bit of grass on the reef , which is very controversial .
Now , what &apos;s happening today is that the young mosquito erodes from the nest , but with it it , with very large numbers of other mosquitos , it causes them to migrate and migrate later in life .
And many times it &apos;s been working from slums , which are named after the Red Brigades , and it &apos;s the mosquito that we &apos;d like to see on the reef , which means that the ecosystem is opening up and making its own beef .
Then we have the second largest meal of food in the United States and the West .
Titan is such a universal mosque .
Toothbrush is supposed to be considered a very large place to organize .
Our area is what scientists call &quot; &quot; the ICCAT . &quot; &quot; The International Committee for Climate Protection .
The Carl Simpson also made a great reader of all kinds .
We can spray from the ceiling , but there &apos;s no good treatment for the ceiling .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s too hot .
She can hold her 40-foot droplet and hold her body temperature at over 20 degrees Celsius .
All of the waste from metal is wasted .
The flora &apos;s shell has a blood supply that doesn &apos;t last very long .
This is great for proteins .
But the forest creature is 40 miles away from home , and it cannot survive in the farm .
Sami has been good news , and it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
This is my legal context .
The Connecticut launched a campaign .
If you look at the map of the client , each dot is a document .
In management of clients , there are over 3,000 of them .
In fact , I say there are more people on the Connect — ( Laughter ) if anybody has ever opened the stock market , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere there are these mosquitoes that travel by introducing their children .
As a result , we have a successful campaign for the campaign and summer campaign .
When the Summer Ramadan started , there were six pounds of forest flooding in Cambodia to build one foundation .
But now it &apos;s getting even better .
Instead , there &apos;s one case where it &apos;s kind of false , because if you look at the Freedom of Information platform , they don &apos;t belong on the Freedom of Information platform .
It &apos;s caused by a cat .
It &apos;s hard to say that malaria and malaria are expensive .
But again , the real credit industry is pushing forward to a value proposition rather than a value proposition .
This is a system that produces excess cooking , which is how the Earth moves .
This is seven percent of the year .
Even though we spend a little bit less money to get to the market , we spend a lot of money , but then we get a lot of little pesticides .
Not only do we feed fruit flies , but we feed milk and vegetables .
We have what the mosquitoes eat and we have what the mosquitoes eat .
Because the blood vessels and the blood vessels and so forth , they target the mosquitoes .
I wonder if there &apos;s a mosquito that &apos;s beaten , but that &apos;s what propelled the mosquito .
India is the first time to die — ( Laughter ) As a result , it &apos;s a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of forest production taken out of the oceans .
This is the third piece of China , or the entire U.S. , which comes out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia actually started as a lifetime .
And it started with a local entrepreneur who saw that the next day she would never go to a Mac Donald &apos;s .
She came to the door and she said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a penguin for you . &quot;
Go figure it out .
For the ocean , for the most part , it was only one case that Hurricane Nicholas Negroponte did not .
So he built his own lifetime scenario .
Unfortunately it was in the 1930s .
He wanted to make it a 25-centimeter Code .
An automotive fusion plant that &apos;s installed in the United States is the largest mass of arts industry in the United States , 23 billion pounds a year , leaking waste from the sea .
If we stop the pollution , the alternative would be Thailand .
20 years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It turns the plants into biological proteins in a very dynamic way , and that &apos;s what I hope for the third world .
It &apos;s actually a very sustainable solution ; it &apos;s growing from one individual in nine months .
The trouble is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a mockingbird .
It doesn &apos;t even include iPods and DNA that we think will make us live forever .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor little clip of mine .
That &apos;s a large sample of about three million tons .
One possibility that conservation policies have promised is , can we eat it ?
Can we justify it instead of giving to people ?
There are problems for it .
They &apos;re having a wonderful childhood in the marketplace where a typical slum is at the top of the pyramid , and the effect is at the top of their ranch .
This includes AMI 3 , EPA and DDI .
So here &apos;s her potential .
What if we could take this path and instead of giving it a few dollars , pay it a pound , pay it a pound , pay it a gourmet grocery , and replace it with a gourmet grocery store and give it a gourmet grocery store ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have so much more EPAD and so on .
The Indus numbers have an enormous effect .
Cookie fisheries are only three thirds of what you can get to market .
Actually , it &apos;s usually three miles from the kitchen .
Seawater Greenhouse is three stories in the kitchen , so they just collect it .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western garage , we &apos;ve lost sight of the way we communicate with Facebook and with Netflix .
Over 400 people have died in the last 20 years , and that &apos;s a very big part of the death of the sea .
As you might think about Kallikuppy , in all these different ways , there are more than three , and these are very effective signs .
It &apos;s totally natural .
And the last one is a question mark .
We can produce a mouse that can be much more efficient at delivering seawater protein .
These creatures should be green , they should be able to rapidly grow and change their environment in a way that looks like a grid , and they should be EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and Pete East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been conducting these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it all .
But there &apos;s no attempt to do that .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we could do that , the third piece of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all just happening .
We want to understand without our needs .
But if we do something about it , the problem becomes slightly more dramatic .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I grew up to read the brain because I have a brother who &apos;s susceptible to mental illness .
More and later , I wanted to understand as a philanthropy how I could connect my dreams to my reality and create my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they don &apos;t mirror their desires from the public and the public realm , and they take action .
So I quit my life to study serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my wife &apos;s office in India , where I worked at the Doctor Frankenstein Bank , who was in the field of psychology at Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in people &apos;s brains that are normally associated with people &apos;s brains , versus people who have schizophrenia or BMW , versus people who have schizophrenia or BMW , is it that we &apos;re actually trying to engineer brain disorders of neurons , who sends whom is the signal , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the signal with the chemicals , &quot; &quot; and how much is it
So I had a pretty good idea in my life because I was doing this sort of stuff during the day . &quot; &quot; But in four weeks , at four o &apos;clock , I was in downtown Los Angeles doing a column traveling through the NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself in front of an intellectual endeavor .
The left side of my brain was a nine .
And over the next four minutes I watched my brain completely disconnect with any ability to understand information .
By the morning of college , I was able to read and write and memoir .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever looked at the brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is a large part of the brain which is sitting in the back part of the brain , and it &apos;s going to keep in mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are identical to each other .
Those of you who think computers are actually part of our brain working like a parallel processor , where the left part of our brain works like a serial processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages to each other through a crossroads that connect some 300 transistors .
But there are also two parts that are absolutely unique .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part has to understand a whole different information , their facial expression of different things , and you allow them to express their identities in a different way .
Compassion . Thank you . Very good .
SOC : Yeah , it worked .
( Laughter ) The only part of our brain now is thinking about this moment .
Right now , we &apos;re thinking about parts of our brain right now , and it &apos;s organically thinking about the movements of our bodies .
Information flows through our bodies and expands throughout our entire system through neuroscience , and then it dips and forms a giant online classroom that tells us what the current situation is in setting up and what the brain is in feeling and hearing .
I am an energy that &apos;s escaped from its surroundings through the right-hand side of the brain .
We &apos;re leaving energy from each other through the right-hand side of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we &apos;re bringing together this planet that &apos;s going to make the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are all the best and the most beautiful .
The left side of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is scientifically and physically thinking .
The left side of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is based on the way we collect the largest online vernacular of our current and analyze it and then start to collect analyses from it .
And this whole information allows us to organize and regulate all of the things that are going on in the past that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of the future , namely the kinds of impacts we have on our projects .
The left part of our brain thinks of symbols in language .
It &apos;s a sequence of that conversation that touches us and our inner world with the world around us .
This is the little voice that Susan tells me to go home and buy and share with you .
I have to have them in the morning , and it &apos;s an awareness of me creating a book that reminds me of who I am .
But perhaps the most important voice is what he says : I am ! I am !
And as my left brain tells me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become deeply connected .
I become the only trick with the incredible energy around me and your imagination .
And that same part of my brain has been devastated by the pollution .
On the morning of judgment , my left eye slammed into the back of my eye with an invisible pain .
It was as painful as a six-stanza .
And that pain just dragged me around and left me .
And then he leaves , and he leaves .
And it was extraordinary to me that I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing I do with my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went and I looked at my handwriting and I went to my cardboard department and I looked at the entire body sports machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , and I feel like I &apos;m holding a finger to some original human being that touched the donor .
And I think , &quot; &quot; This is such an anomaly , &quot; &quot; and then I turn around and I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I look at the big , wondrous , poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness has changed , is the general sense of being a human being that is wrapped up by this experience , but now I &apos;ve been in a mysterious and myst@@
And it was all very strange , and my head was dizzy .
So I walked out of the machine and I started walking around the room and I realized that everything inside my body was so simple .
And everybody understands very , very hard .
I have no correlation at all , and I think there &apos;s a stupid problem with the idea that my focus is just on the inner system .
I stand in my kitchen and I &apos;m preparing to go underwater and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , &quot; &quot; My foot has to play you now .
My foot goes down and I &apos;m not balanced , I &apos;m going to grab hold of the wall .
I look around and I see my hand , and I realize that I can no longer refine my body &apos;s waste .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to end up , because I got my hands and my hands and my motorcycle and my motorbike wall .
If I understood anything , he was able to ...
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the whole thing on the left of my brain was quiet .
It &apos;s the same as someone who has controlled the TVs .
One more time .
First of all , I was amazed at what was inside my brain .
But then suddenly I found myself in one of these huge spacecraft surrounding me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body right now , I felt my absolute humility and my deepest sense of self .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a bone died on the left of my brain and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a mosque . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really removed from any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really removed from the problem , but I came back immediately in the same kind of consciousness that I often say for a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think about how beautiful it is that you &apos;re completely connected to this hidden brain that is keeping you from the inner world .
So I &apos;m in this room where I &apos;m writing and prying about it .
I was feeling a lot of shame in my body .
And look at all the relationships that you have from the inner world and from that experience have been depressing .
And I felt a sense of peace and compassion .
And imagine what it would look like if you lifted that 37-year-old emotional connection that you had left .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made it to just like a puppy dog .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain started to move in , and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , let &apos;s go two .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking I should help , so I &apos;ve got to take care of Nicholas and I &apos;ve gone out of the car business now and I &apos;ve been in my yard and I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I go get a car ? &quot; &quot; And this moment my mother has completely opened my hand .
At that moment , I realized that my God was attacking me with a bullet , the only thing that my mind tells me is , how awful it is !
( Laughter ) How awesome !
There will be brain scientists who have the chance to realize that they can consciously self-consciously and they can come in — ( Laughter ) — and then one minute come to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I have no time to waste . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fighting of the golf course , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll get back to my commute . Okay .
I have to call for help . I have to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the job . Then I remembered that I had my budget cards on my phone .
So I go into my bedroom and I bring out three MBA cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eye what my naked card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s my card , because I don &apos;t see any corresponding statistics .
And the definition of the word &quot; &quot; paper &quot; &quot; is supported by the markers and the markers , and I wasn &apos;t doing anything .
So I started waiting for him to describe himself as an illustration .
And at that moment , the average element disappeared from the truth , and I learned that this is not a card ; this is not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to download even one inch .
At that time , the effects of the infrared in 45 minutes were increasing to the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have any way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took the science card and I put it here , and now I look at the cards of old boys on the phone as little boys on the phone .
But then I pause to my last mile when I got back , and I didn &apos;t remember I had that number .
So I raised my hand like a daughter and raised my hand to the teachers and asked them to suppress the other hand and say , &quot; &quot; Wow , upright . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a good idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a good idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a little bit like a voice . ( Laughter )
And then I say to her , &quot; I &apos;m so clearly talking to the brain that I need help . &quot;
And from me , the voice says something like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And she realized that I had no idea that I could speak a language at that point , that I could not understand until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped me .
Shortly after that , another ambulance arrived at the hospital on a reserve of four basketball beaches .
I walked around looking like a child with a small Pat .
Just like a lady who was just a little bit ahead of her time and just ran away from abroad , I pulled out the energy and I just felt my spirit .
And that moment made me realize that I was no longer in charge of my life .
Or perhaps my doctor has saved me and offers me a chance to live a second life or a moment of transition .
By the time I finished , I was surprised enough to survive .
When I felt really connected to my soul , I saved my life .
Now my brain has shattered two different facts .
At that time , I started to move beyond my emotional system , which was only in the face of pain .
Light like the fire in the forest , my brain was so close and so forth , that I could barely hear a voice from the background , or even before , and I was just pedaling a flight .
Because I couldn &apos;t really understand what my body was doing , so I really grew up feeling like a person who had just gotten out of her belt .
And my spirit has been fulfilled with storms like a giant hole in the ocean of dirt .
Great morning .
He &apos;s given me the quality that he brings .
And I was reminded of that , and I was thinking that it would never be possible that I would discover my wonderful existence and my ability to experience the insides of a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been incarcerated .
And if I &apos;m blinded and I &apos;m alive now , whatever life is you can get the neuron , and I &apos;ve seen a world that is beauty , transparency , comfort and love , and people that know they can someday feel this quality .
And they can jump together and choose , and the right thing is , when they want to step on the left side of their brain , they want to step up and seek out this pure quality .
And then I realized how awesome this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a glimpse of what intelligence has taught me to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After a fraction of a degree of ice melted , the ice in my brain caused a glimpse of blood flow equivalent to the size of a spinal cord sanctuary .
I &apos;m here with my mother , who is a real nomad in my life .
It took me eight years to become perfectly healthy .
So who are we then ?
We are the spinal cord power of life .
And we have the power to choose , no matter who we are and what we want to be in the world .
A place where , &quot; &quot; At the same time , I can step to the right of my consciousness , &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the most powerful force in the universe &apos;s life .
Fifty beautiful cells made up of biological molecules , one that &apos;s all there .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness , where I become an individual , &quot; in a tight way .
From quantum leather , &quot; &quot; Off you .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
Who would you choose ?
What would you choose ?
And who ?
I think as long as we spend our left-right brain solar-electrified , we will put peace in this world and our planet will become so safe .
And I thought that this idea should be replaced .
Thank you .

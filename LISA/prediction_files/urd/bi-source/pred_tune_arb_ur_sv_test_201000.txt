Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They gave me my name tags , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , just before Christmas , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating free .
So I asked myself , do you have the Arab Spring ?
She looked at me strangely , thinks she must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Syria ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , compassion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Who said .
He was speaking to me with three people , as he said to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy delivered two words to a girl in accuracy , and everywhere .
How can he speak this way ?
At that moment I began to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s driving me to speak my own country ?
Where is that possible ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am as many people as I know , who have reached a point in their lives where , roughly , they drop everything that &apos;s in their pocket , just because they like to say , and they &apos;re terrible .
Should I embrace my whole culture , my imaginations , my spirits and spirits ?
We may have the most important ideas of war in the history of children .
Do they want to send me all the things I &apos;ve learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What makes sense ?
Although , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make a decision about the spirit of what Elvis did for me .
The Arabic language does not require today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research , that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we observe when we work on the project of a particular tree , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the iPad .
If we do that , they will cover our cups .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
It &apos;s the Arab mother &apos;s language .
Research says that in other languages , we need to translate that into our mother tongue .
In other languages , the value of the mother tongue is the key to creativity .
How ?
Gabriel Gabriel , when he first started writing , he exploded Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in the vehicle where he grew up feeling a certain happiness , listening to a particular voice , and thinking about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their texts in English , you feel so happy , you feel the same sense .
You can imagine that this is also their teaching in English , this little boy who was walking around in a village outside of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no engineer can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging economies are occurring .
Germany , France , Germany and China are in all forms .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the wastes , they spend a lot of money on their adventures .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this emerging idea is not yet available to us , and we want to get to this emerging world .
They were countries that were like us for a period of time , but decided to try to grow , to research , and to go to those countries , such as Tarja , the U.N. , and so on , to move their languages forward as they were chasing girls .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you take the product of Turkey or whale or whale , and you don &apos;t write it on a ticket , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these characters , unprecedented , like we are more time .
So in order to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to maintain their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Adoration , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will remind you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how , how .
Languages are not just for conversation ; words are just for us .
Language is a sign of a certain set of levels of our lives , and the words that are constrained by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Self-consciousness , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special circuit in your brain . There are special emotions for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of the unifying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What about our mind ?
How would you understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Friedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ? &quot;
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , then I better go and spend time talking about it .
It &apos;s that these impacts remind us of a particular thing .
I have a French speaker friend who &apos;s a French speaker .
I was asking her for a second .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to impose his wife and translate it one night to try and translate what it means to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A woman named it &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then several nights later she tried to understand .
He wondered , how could someone really be so clear ?
Do they want to self-destruct ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right by the way ; the way he thinks about it is different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me for yesterday , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I felt when I heard the other day . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate that , &quot; &quot; I raised her hand and why you were . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then she said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I put my hand on and I let you go . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s translated . It &apos;s shown me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to convey the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a mindset for the society , and we started the Arabic language protocol .
Although many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you struggling ?
Whatever the hell is suffering , let &apos;s move on . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protagonist received a message , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept this . You spoke in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because , like , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if anyone tells me , I &apos;m fascinated by the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be resilient in the way that our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the same as ours and the same as ours .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; The right sign is .
Very simple , but very efficient .
After that , we started another exercise with the landscape of the letters on Earth .
You , looking outside at an example , a framework in which the letter black and the blue box is labeled &quot; kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Don &apos;t actually kill your tongue .
We really should not kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to find a existence for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And this is a great opportunity for new , new and compassion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; Cole &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; girls .
We are so cold !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve described the word &quot; &quot; chocolate &quot; &quot; as opposed to &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They like to admit two , but I have to admit that word that &apos;s so good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We don &apos;t need to cure ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to let anyone grow up , or that we &apos;re going to have a choice about language , putting pressure on us , or putting pressure on our patients and thinking .
We need to invent our imagination .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t redefine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
At that time , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start today .
They make a nano or a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global level .
He can repeat the Arabic language on the front lines .
So , it &apos;s not fair that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we have to know that , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , part of the solution , is our guess .
In the past , what can you do today ?
Who &apos;s Twitter ?
In compassion , I refuse you , although , my time is up , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic script , doesn &apos;t write English !
( Applause ) It &apos;s true ! It &apos;s not a language .
You will enter a virtual world with a linguistic language .
Getting back and forth is not easy .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do many other things .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for preservation in this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , speaks in a language of her father .
When my daughter was born , I don &apos;t believe him , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve been blaming my daughter for the light of my daughter in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot;
And it &apos;s not expected that nobody will ever stop . ( Applause ) You can get rid of this cultural press . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to him that it reminds us that we are not a miracle of our existence , but I am a miracle of the minority that is poisoning to my people , until you saw me not dropping a bank , and I &apos;m going to tell you that generation of inequality does not correspond to our generation until they &apos;re a celebrity until they &apos;re a celebrity ,
( Applause )
My favorite cartoon is the dot .
In college , my primary career was vegetables , which meant I had to write a lot of magazines .
Now a normal person when they write something , something like this happens .
You know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll get started early , but the first week you do a lot of work and more work later , everything &apos;s done , except it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response would be all right , but the actual work of the script would be on the page , and then I would do something like that .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every text function .
And then there &apos;s a new paper on the page , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my common approach was not an option .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , I decided that I would do something like this .
This year &apos;s worth of debt .
I &apos;m going to start small , middle months , and I &apos;m going to increase the behavior of the work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard to learn ?
No big deal , right ?
Then there was a funny thing .
How many months ago ?
Go home , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a big project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would also disappear , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had something .
And two weeks went by , two weeks went by , two weeks went by .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in the D.R. , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote down 90 pages , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets — no two streets , two streets , two streets — two streets , two streets , two streets — two streets , two streets , three
I thought , well , it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Would you be Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the paper . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look at me today , that &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about science .
My roommate constantly pulls out six people and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brains of people and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain of the senior people differences between six people .
Understanding that I made a leaf where I could easily detect both brains and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a teacher , that &apos;s not a show , but consider it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
There are tens of thousands of decisions in both brains , but the rest of the brain is in the human brain that &apos;s fun .
Now what does this mean in terms of a stranger ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine when it doesn &apos;t .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Work is the best time for the finish line . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart philanthropy will make decisions to make sense , but Ben didn &apos;t like that plan , so he tells the team , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please leave the page for Charles &apos; page . &quot; &quot; Tennis and Twain Harold , because I know it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) And then we get to the bottom , and see , in 10 minutes , something new emerged ?
After that , you &apos;re going to look at YouTube , which is beginning to talk about the theme of Rockefeller &apos;s talk , and much later on , you &apos;re going to end up watching online as the mother of Tony Bieber .
( Laughter ) It will take some time for all of those things , so there won &apos;t be any time for it to do today .
What a controversy ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the foundation of compassion that you want to hear .
It just wants to be present .
It doesn &apos;t have any sense of the future ; it &apos;s just two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you do and you spend your entire life going forward , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and increased generation , maybe in rural areas , would go like this .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , the vehicle isn &apos;t too far .
We are an increasingly educated species , and yet we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a conscious decision maker , who allows us to do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he thinks about all these things .
And all we want to do is to be the one that makes us happy .
Sometimes brothers seem to be absolutely right to do what is easily and emotionally friendly to eat , to think or to feel compassionate at times .
There &apos;s an incident .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is the momentum .
And for the sixth-graders , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends a lot of time in the short term , a simple and crazy way that tens of thousands of years away .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) The dark net is the place where the Sistine people are best known .
There is a time when obesity should not be directed .
In the dark field , what &apos;s more coming to you is not really enough , because it &apos;s not right , space fear , fear , anxiety , and self-hostility — all the attributes that go along well .
The question is , in this way , when the source of the command is broken , how do the rest of the command is located in the zones that are less happy but more important ?
It turns out that systems also remain unprotected , which always protect them in their dark moments — somebody mentioned the lie .
( Laughter ) Now this house is mostly comfortable , but when David Lynn gets closer , it gets really bad , or at the time when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that the box is just like that .
Now I had a relationship with it in my life , because a few months ago , TED people called me and they invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Apparently I did .
In the past , my dream came to TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something else going on in my brain that defined humanity .
He said , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what happens one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian map at the bottom of the 20th century and see the Indian map , let &apos;s just break it down until we see Sarah , and look at India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So this day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a month later , people at TED decided to name the Koran .
I broke the web and it was my photograph that I was holding out .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The street that was predicted , and within seconds the system was reported to be on the receiving . ( Laughter )
And remember , he &apos;s afraid of the house , he &apos;s walking up the tree .
And finally , and finally , religious decision-makers sent books and I can start talking .
Now the homework assignment that talks about in every category has been broken , so someone like me will give two weeks to a murderer , and the beginning of the talk will not be heard , and then incredibly successful leaders will sign up for a long time to go and write a story .
And the accumulation of three clear-cuts is what we call the system of sixth-graders .
It &apos;s not very good . It &apos;s not pleasant .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised at the impact of it .
In fact , I got thousands of emails from all over the world and from people , from all kinds of different backgrounds .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and also massively transmitted HIV status .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them said something and wrote : &quot; I am too obsessed with this . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and various emails .
In the tradition of these people , Mairead wrote about how much Swedish did in their lives , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , what if the system is right ?
Why are they all in black ?
It turns out there are two orders of magnitude .
Today I gave you all these examples , talking about subjects , all of them being LEDs .
And when David is lying , recently , his effects are dead because he reaches home .
But the sixth one is a different kind of approach , and it &apos;s not from a David Lane .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like some art or business — like some art or business , when you don &apos;t start paying attention to finding behavior , to finding work .
In addition to doing so , there are many things that David Lunner and I don &apos;t have to associate with , like connecting with his family , exercise , sensing your health , finding your relationships , telling your relationships to whom you &apos;re not being touched .
Now , if the only way you can do a job is to get a job in the basement , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data is in the trash that &apos;s disappearing .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The recent implications are that you can &apos;t drive them , they &apos;re always with us .
And it &apos;s a kind of typical leather that I see very little and talks about a little bit less than conventional leather .
You &apos;re making headlines out of noise and bad news .
And this can become the currency of the Taliban .
So I thought , this is why they &apos;re emailing , and this is why they &apos;re getting bored .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
Time magazine assembled them , sometimes in their lives .
The trouble is not that they cannot ask their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I read all these emails , and one thing came out — I think six people didn &apos;t exist .
I think you &apos;re all alone .
It may not be a very complicated condition . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of you in the audience have good relationships , but the choices to remember are when there &apos;s no digital lens .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block represents a week , it &apos;s a new year &apos;s environment .
These aren &apos;t a lot of boxes , especially when something of them is extracted .
I think we all need to get to navigate this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because in every single life , there &apos;s no time for it .
We need to be careful .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have the same homes there , maybe this work should start right now .
Maybe not from now on , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eight days in the United States and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the United States and Afghanistan was moving from a neighborhood in Afghanistan to a neighborhood in Afghanistan to help provide an office for the Afghan government to help provide an office to protect the jobs of Afghanistan , to help provide an office to protect the Afghan security forces , to fight out that there had to be
He came in at the end of an aftermath , and he was lying around three corners , and with a lot of stuff , he watched as a kid delivering Cpin Seventine , and he watched as a kid delivering Cpin Seventon to save the dead .
One of the people who knew her children , one of the guards , and one of the guards was running upstairs by one of the guards , and one of the guards was running upstairs by one helicopter .
In this case , it &apos;s shown that the Copenhagen and the Easter Bunny both have this terrible geology of melting in the heat .
They put them in helicopter , and then you can see the Caspian Seventine going down and dropping it before they allowed others to save .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
Here &apos;s a love one , and I knew why I work with people that they don &apos;t .
You know , at the end of the day , people who want to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are desperate to judge others for our benefit .
We have an electrical calculator !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they look at the waves .
Those who are better at reaching out to this vision of services , who are better at reaching out to this vision of services .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you have a dark environment , each of us has the capacity to connect with each other , so each of us has the capacity to connect with each other and increase the capacity to do that within others .
I have some of the greatest privilege of getting these people together yesterday and saying to me , &quot; &quot; Why can you do this ?
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it to me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The hard thing about believing and collaboration is that these are emotions , not theirs .
Not so many of you have said , &quot; &quot; Get me alone . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I put two people together and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years in the remote areas , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , we see that the world is full of dangers , all of these religions are very focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Wanting is a lack of resources , a lack of data , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce the longevity of our lives , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce the longevity of our lives .
And so we were ready in the form of social animals where we &apos;re all together and doing what I call a &quot; &quot; pity &quot; &quot; moment in a closet where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we were committed and committed .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can sleep at night and I can swim to see some dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you there , it means you don &apos;t look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The new ones are just like this .
This world is fueled by dangers , things that are trying to make our lives difficult or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
This could be a huge increase in the cost of the stock market .
It can be a new technology that &apos;s going to take your business class and drop it overnight ; it can be a new technology that &apos;s going to take your business class and drop it overnight .
Or it could be your opposite , which is sometimes you &apos;re trying to run .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s trying to drive your rise and your businesses to get you out of business , it &apos;s trying to drive your rise and your businesses to get you out of business .
We don &apos;t have any authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s the place where the mathematics is at , because that &apos;s the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in his organization and the lives of the people in his organization and the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to assess their own and benign results in order for people to stay alive and cherish their peace results so that people can feel safe and feel their personal relationships so that they can compromise things .
I was on a journey , and I realized that when a trip had passed by and tried to get it to the front door , I saw the stakeholders on the front door just like he passed the law , just like he was .
Once upon a time I tried to walk on it , the first time I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do we have machines like these ?
Why can &apos;t you feel the same way as humans do ? &quot; &quot; And he answered me exactly the same way .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Air Force is not because they rank the Islamic people better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their leaders .
You see , if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves from one another and therefore less organizing .
What a great leader gives me the most profound example of how to become a parent is a great leader for her , and the most profound example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what do you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to see opportunities , education , discipline , when necessary , we want to see opportunities , education , organization and record , when necessary , to see them grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Great leaders want that .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , discipline , when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to give them the opportunity to act and to achieve the greater good that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve the greater good that we &apos;ve ever imagined .
Charlie Kamen , who &apos;s the CEO of a technology company called Next Jump , in New York City , is the CEO of a technology company called Next Jump , who said , if your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organizations ?
Charley went on to de-animate business . Charley went on to de-animate business .
If you &apos;re a Next Jump employee , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of effective problems .
But if you have a problem , they will lead you and help you , just like we would do to any child who drops out of school .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s because there are so many people who are very angry and angry , some bankers from the CEO , and that &apos;s because they have so many people who are very angry and angry , some bankers from CEOs , and that &apos;s because they have so many people who are very angry and angry , some bankers from the CEO , who are unequally motivated and unequal .
This is not data .
But they have laid down fundamental laws of gravity .
They &apos;ve grown an ancient social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their grandchildren the experience of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-@@
It &apos;s something that compares us to data .
Can anyone predict that Gando spent 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t teachers make 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problems with that ? Absolutely not .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Great leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
They &apos;re going to give people skin data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people skin data to save .
Baby Shahmer in the Ministry of Medicine , they put together a mini-science company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who was a supermarket trader , and they put 30 percent of their roads overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy more goods .
They needed 10 million dollars in children , and so many of the companies that you have today are bringing in the board and doing the illegal things .
And Bob answered that .
You can see that the Babylonian gender does not believe .
Instead , Bob believes in prevention , and reducing heart valves is much more difficult , and reducing heart valves is much more difficult .
And then they built a personal project .
That every employee , from the Critic to the CEO , had to hire everyone in the small four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But as Bob mentioned the program , he &apos;s doing extremely well .
He said , it &apos;s better that we all receive bigger gaps , because some of us receive bigger gaps and get bigger .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as people expect , when they feel protected from the dignity of an organization , trust and collaboration is natural .
And as if nobody had expected , people started to trade from each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful families .
So some people took five volumes to get the other one through three volumes .
Gravity is an exception , not a cure .
I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the most successful organizations , and I know a lot of people who are benefiting from the most successful organizations which are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re lovely citizens , and we do what they say because they have the authority , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in the middle of organizations who are not receiving any authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the person on the right , and they &apos;ve had the privilege of seeing the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the technologies that were going on out of the store , and as philosophers do , a way to eat in the neighborhood and prepare to their friends , and when they were eating nothing for them .
And when he returned to the field , his friends gave him some food from his plants so he could eat because it was .
We call them leaders first .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered first , we call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can be safe , we call them leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can be safe , we call them leaders , because they choose to be the victims , so that people can be safe , and that &apos;s how we do that , and when we do that , it &apos;s very unlikely that our people will be loved .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their pancreas and their pancreas so that they can see the dream of their leaders becoming real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your pancreas and your pancreas to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us too . &quot; &quot; And is this not the organization that we all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a small story about the Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the supply of water and shelter is so unbelievable , such as the mosquito , and growing in these conditions is so difficult to grow once in 17 years old , I was quietly sitting in the bush with friends in the bush .
The sun is heating up in the middle of the summer .
And as I was doing my breakfast , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you create something that just ticks your skin and doesn &apos;t make you sad ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Yes , I need to buy this . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people have no access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred and fifty of them are in Africa , and only half are in South Africa .
Different diseases are found in the environment that is the most dangerous tragedy known as trachoma .
The threat to the naked eye is an inflection given by the naked eye , and by the way , you can remove the threat constantly .
This disease kills millions of people every year on a continuous basis , and most importantly , it &apos;s only for you to leave the trachoma that you have to leave : no gift , no farms , no engineering .
After watching these graphics statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not just doing this for myself , and it &apos;s not that I want to make a living , but I &apos;m doing less of it because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I went on to save my brother &apos;s 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have an Internet , I went on the Internet for 20
And I looked at this as a profound problem .
So Mahammad said yes , our formula is ready .
Now we need to take this thing apart .
Four years later , with the mobile phone , 40 pages full of businesses writing my patent on the phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; No more broken ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first broken lamp .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need the digestion .
( Laughter ) So after trying to make it work in high school and limited resources , which I had , the U.S. Health Organization approached some new people , did more of it , and now we have a full-scale model of impact , which is ready for the market , now available in the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They only buy the names they need . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; they buy a ticket because it makes more sense .
So we put DryBath in these creative blocks .
You put it between the two and the outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple one is exchanging only in five ranges .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about the nature of manufacturing .
We even want DryBath the air conditioner up there . ( Laughter ) Once less than a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water whenever they leave and we could save two houses for children , which is two houses , two houses , more than two houses for school , two houses for more than two houses , two houses for children .
After watching this global impact , we &apos;ve taken out our key value advantage , transparency and conservation .
DryBath is an aspiring man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re entering this process , now we &apos;re actually going into a multinational purchase that can be put into the retail market , and one question I &apos;m going to ask you to hear today about the Limpopo Current , with an AOlympics every single week , conveying a method that doesn &apos;t have to ruin the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot in this recent process , Google announced me , as the world &apos;s first young girl .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that has acquired this , and one thing that surprised me so much , and it &apos;s all about why I didn &apos;t want to be silent about it . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m giving you some of these results today , and I &apos;m also surprised to myself , what are the key drivers of success in organizations that are actually initially successful .
I believe that donor agencies are the best motivator to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will be left with the human abilities which were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so great , why is it that most of them fail ?
So I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know that eventually the universe is the most important for success at the beginning .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , pushing a lot of my audacity and misconceptions that came to me from some of the organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was founded by a 12-year-old company named January Health College on a Kandini school assignment to go to school when I was making solar power tools , then to college , when I was making radio .
I graduated from college , and I founded the software company .
And 20 years ago , at the beginning of the Library of India , in the last 20 years , we started many , many successes , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to put theorists on these factors to tell you the greatest success or failure of organizations .
So I looked at these five .
First , think .
I think there &apos;s something here .
So I wrote my company called &quot; &quot; Idea Live &quot; &quot; the old days when you think about it .
With interference , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to control leather or collapse , is even more critical .
I never thought I &apos;d be speaking at TED last year about Mike Titon , but once he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan , until I don &apos;t have a mom . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
The ability to organize a team to move past the vehicle is important .
Machine is an elusive reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about delivery ?
With him , it seemed to me that the most important thing for the last success was to me .
So think about investment .
Sometimes organizations make a huge investment .
Could it be the most important one ?
After that , of course — is it the right time ?
Did it come out very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t ready for it ?
It &apos;s short , so you will come and learn the world ?
Is that right ?
Or was it too late , and before there was so much anxiety ?
So I found these five factors very respectful in many organizations .
And the idea was to hire 100 companies , and 100 of them outside to try and find some scientific results .
So first of all , on these projects , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollars of commerce .
And on the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we had a lot of hope , but no success .
And then I tried to cultivate all these characteristics , as I think these companies had moved on to these symbols .
Then in the outdated corporations , I looked at weird adventures , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here are some things : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was massive investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the most influenced was the success and failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was the choice of time .
At the right time , 42 percent is due to the difference between success and failure .
Tim and Shirley are on the other hand , and then thinking , being different , thinking alone , is actually a third number .
But it &apos;s not really clear , it &apos;s not that the thought doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was surprised that the thought doesn &apos;t matter .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important , when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the business model and investment in my mind .
I think the business model still remains pervasive , because you can do it without a market model , and then when you grow the money in cows , you include it .
And investment , if initially low investment , is now increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples of all of these nozzles here .
Take the big success of Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s very popular that a lot of investors looked at this because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to put some of their houses on the shelves ?
Of course , it proved wrong .
One of the reasons for the success of compassion is that the best market model , the idea , and the market thinking is the right time .
This company came in front of the air handling units when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people to respond to the proposal of a farmer in their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
However , time was absolutely right to make the money they needed .
Dreaders were also aspiring for additional support ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed a web page .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 here at TED , was at a time when companies wanted to look at more companies .
We thought the idea was great , but actually , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . We were very excited about it , and with a great business model , we had to work with great artists at Holland .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband band band was very low .
It was really hard to watch that online video , you know what to do in your browser and what to do in your browser , and finally this company revealed itself in 2003 .
Just two years later , when the problem with Adobe Flash was solved and lowered by over 50 percent in Broadband America , YouTube was reaching the highest time .
Incredibly , the best of times .
It turns out that YouTube , when it started , was not a professional model .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to happen .
But he was choosing the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really important .
Idea is powerful .
But maybe time &apos;s choice is really important .
And the best way to quantify time is to see if there &apos;s a really short circuit to show you .
And the real confidence is that , what comes out of those results , I &apos;m not outrageous , because if you like something , you want to watch it tomorrow , but in the case of timing , you have to work very safely .
As I said earlier , primary organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help increase your success , and then it won &apos;t happen in the second best sense in the world .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best listeners .

&#91; &quot; &quot; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the greatest data in history &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Five successes have painted expensive and powerful people &#93; &#91; pocket money in non-governmental societies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve launched a grant to explain the traffic of the Gulf Watts . &#93; &#91; Fifty acts of this week are at the center of the revolution
Five out of all those cases painted a small portion of white powder companies .
We have the inner stories of villages , banks and villages , who come in with these fundraising forms , and they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can look at the text messages , you can see how they work , how they work .
It &apos;s already beginning to show up .
The director of the United Nations is unknown .
We also have this news that the weekly doctors in the lab are wearing clothing companies .
The revenue of the next two billion dollars goes to the original Mir of the Red Bridge from his childhood friend , who &apos;s a famous sitcom .
And many brilliant people will be infected , and the ones that will come from these stories will be at home with more hidden documentaries .
Now , this looks like a magic movie or a John Geiger character that I have .
What should we do about it ?
But the fact that agronomists and power people are putting their money where they &apos;re not supposed to be taxed , meaning that efficient programs like teachers have less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my company , Gobble Watts , this is amazing .
The global media and political leadership are talking about how people have their influence in weapons-grade companies , which we &apos;ve been exploring for decades .
I think for people , this is the hidden world , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s sort of like Russian girls .
You can run a company inside , a company inside , a company inside , which is almost impossible to figure out who is behind this box .
For organizations to disrupt law enforcement , it &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s happening .
I think this is also interesting , I think , in America that hasn &apos;t been very aware of this .
Maybe it &apos;s because the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be on this scale .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
It &apos;s because of a way of organizing companies , there are just a few of them in the United States of Moscow .
I think if we &apos;re going to look at Kenema Irish innovations or Delhi View or Mountain Home or News , things that correlate with the United States .
But a lot of American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give little information to corporate campaigns , even from the Leibati card .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
It makes it easier for nine soldiers to invest in .
The role of this kind is affecting all of us .
Now in the Gulf Watts , we wanted to look at how this problem works .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did is we formed a campaign to run 13 intelligence companies .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to transport the village across America to a home , a ship and a neighborhood .
The heartbreaking thing was that all the villages gave a one-by-one demonstration of how to move their village .
These were all primary meetings , and we didn &apos;t make any money for ourselves , and we didn &apos;t give them a money , but this was a bad idea for the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not done by individuals .
It &apos;s not about individuals who spoke to us about cheating and promise .
It &apos;s not just a censor scientist found in Scandal .
It &apos;s a system that works , that protects electricity , transparency , gravity and insurgency .
And for that to happen , we will change that game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it difficult for them to do so .
It can be imaginary , as things we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , so people who are excited and powerful will always be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This issue was addressed as a political event , but the British Prime Minister David Comedy put it in 3.8 seconds that had been in South America in 2013 .
And currently Europe is forming Eve at the center of the Caribbean , which is basically the country of Europe or is controlling them .
What you can see is that the HIV is behind it .
Difference in terms of the ruling policies in the center and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to go up very quickly , so we were five .
We want to look at inventions , large-scale companies , used across the world and in the U.S.
This change is happening in the Gulf Ventures .
You need to reach out to the people who are familiar with you behind barbershop companies .
Remember , they speak up , they &apos;re not good for this kind of reasoning , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to encourage the legitimate changes of hidden information .
We can reverse engineer that secret by pressing the touch and reading schools .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Juliet .
It &apos;s said that Lux , who invented you , has had a great deal of accents in the last few years that are beyond all the media in the world .
Can that be true ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a preconceived notion — isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is showing efficient at providing a small group of workers with the kind of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How is that ?
How do people recommend ?
And how do you empower them ?
Julian Sanging : There are all these — I can tell you — using public services in the right ways , and we have so many ways to get the information to us .
So we use very high-resolution watermarks to shift materials from one place online to another , to draw signals from legal researchers like Sweden and Bill &apos;s .
We get the data from a public health service , Roman Shirt or whatever , organizing it as a public news agency , laughing — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about broadcasting information to people , and then protecting yourself against the illegal and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is true , but you actually never know what the extension is .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ll always get there , and if we get there at some point , we &apos;ll quickly obtain the information .
( Phone clapping ) Oh my God .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s sort of coming up here and asking what the code is for TED &apos;s talk . ( Laughter )
For example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , so this is a report .
It was a hidden logic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was over there for 18 years .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the book — because of the authoritarian efforts that were trying to infer China , they bought 20 million pounds of copy that they bought on the report and on a report like that .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for their political benefit , which was the best person — now is the most enlightened person in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
So in 2007 , we were able to accomplish this , and we were able to run the first election in December 2008 .
When we took that report , three days later , Kabul decided to become a friend of mine , a friend of mine who was terrified by Daniel Arppe , so this report was handed over to the corner of the capital .
Chris Anderson : And — so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s just — it &apos;s happened in Kenya , not with cutting-edge cutting , but on average , and on your team , it changed the result of selection .
Julian Sanging : Yes . This is the headline of Gaddafi and then ubiquitous in all the major countries of Kenya , in Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from outside .
And he believed , after a few months , that Kenya &apos;s spiritual community was able to talk about it .
And this weekend took 20 days off to China &apos;s television , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the weekends , according to a Chinese Internet genome report , and it changed the result of selection .
CA : Wow , so your secret interpretation really changed the world ?
Julian Sanging : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re just showing you a little video of a little demo of this .
This video is so heavy . But here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-speed video .
RD : I &apos;m sorry , when you pick them up , and you give them two .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
It &apos;s clean . It &apos;s fine . Gill is gone .
When they &apos;re in front of you , tell me — go read .
All of them cost .
Holy shit !
( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost . Gill gets lost . ( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost .
Hatel — two big masters , two big masters .
We should now walk , time is up .
Okay , now we &apos;ve got eight people with our hands .
Here we see two Hilly Catter , and we &apos;re still making vegetables .
Roger . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two , it &apos;s two , we &apos;re on the roof .
Oh , sorry . What was going on ?
God bless you , God bless you . All right . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people excited about it .
These were the first in three places that happened .
CA : So there were 11 people involved in that , two brilliant directors ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! The two employees of the Reuters , two small children were killed .
In total , from 18 to 26 people were killed .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of anger .
What was the main reason for regret , you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with incredible inequality of power .
On the one hand , some people are walking in a gill , and then one kilometer away from the nearby helicopter is starting to detect 30 kilometers of gallons of electricity on each person — from each other — and also giving birth to children .
They also had two journalists who were not aware of this , because they were willing to do it .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining was awarded , and it &apos;s said that he acknowledged in Cate Roman that he presented this video to you over 280,000 and a half thousand other U.S. public officials as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Sanging : So we &apos;ve done something with accepting the datasets .
Five days ago , it was sentenced to receive 150,000 commitments and 50 commitments .
But what we &apos;ve done now is we &apos;ve added a proposal to a U.S. safety house at the beginning of the year , but they have no context .
I mean , I often went to this safety house .
CA : I mean , if you gave thousands of devices to the American security family ...
Julian Sanging : Let &apos;s give them a go . ( CA : Y &apos;all go ? ) Juliet Sanging : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) Juliet Sung : Because these things show that , actually , what the Arab states are , are more violent in their governments .
If you look at the hidden evidence , the materials of this sort are inside them .
CA : Let &apos;s play around with it .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy normally ?
Why are you creating hidden information ?
Julian Sanging : So the question is how important information in the world is , how information can be stored .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you want to get the information out there , when you want to get the information out there , you hope to do something good , because what companies know better , and they also know the story , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But are there any risks to this as an individual or a collective society where innovation doesn &apos;t exist unexpectedly ?
Julian Sanging : We didn &apos;t do anything with them .
I mean , our Great Depression is our operation .
With information , we &apos;re sampling in a particular way the information that &apos;s being collected — the information that &apos;s available to somebody else &apos;s sample .
But there are also some mysteries — for example , your doctor has your information ; it &apos;s a mystery — but we &apos;re talking about the civic goods that come and join us .
CA : All right , so they &apos;re doing this with emotion .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , whose daughter is applied to the United States Senate , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had something so effective that somebody likes to hire other people .
It shows an American science of the dead .
What this has impacted — but it has shown millions of people around the world that the United States is physiological .
Although they &apos;re not , my daughter &apos;s not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julian Sanging : Here &apos;s how we ask many questions like this .
But remember in the cave , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , so they rarely watch it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions , it doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions .
Because they obviously see all of this .
It &apos;s going to change their mind and thinking about how they spend all this money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re looking forward to what you think is the hidden information of companies and governments .
That &apos;s great .
But doesn &apos;t it seem ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light you have to maintain a sense of purpose to yourself ?
Julian Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We have no idea what other minds are like .
If they do that , it would be very difficult for us to do that , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are ethically comfortable feeling that they &apos;re going to increase the work later .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , what did we make sense of — this is where the insurgency came from .
You can also imagine that there will be different ideas about the cause and the joy .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or we can make problems .
What is the point of view of Juliet ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! Let &apos;s do something about it .
CA : These are very good people , Jim , very good .
Let &apos;s try and do another experiment . Let me show you another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a really interesting story , which is old , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Sanging : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — a lot of important Russians were built in the banks , as in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we had the Report Mile — which was a very good analysis of this — where I was told that in fact , conservation companies were competing against different forms of steel companies to go down there and see them .
And there was something about the federal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing above that report . That was a very difficult thing for us .
We didn &apos;t know what to expect because we didn &apos;t know who to write and what to do with it .
So we were wondering , perhaps this company has done all of this in a competitive game .
We put it on the ground , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This stuff is so good , and I look it right , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the same week that he wrote , and he wanted to figure out the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to write the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , let &apos;s talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by this ?
Is that really yours ? Because they brought us that look at Scripture with the name of French philanthropy with DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of reimagining and imagining what materials are , and it &apos;s trying to write and get the letters from those people .
CA : All right . So what &apos;s the data from inside the Bible ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at the time , we &apos;re harnessing several breakthroughs as difficult as possible .
Our response to this has been going on for months because we are improving our buck system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s cruel .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s playing , more than our capabilities are piloted on us because of our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in public services , but we don &apos;t have a lot of people who can edit and edit information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , how many reporters or journalists alike dream ?
Julie Song : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to resolve quickly because the materials that we &apos;re using are our interfaces , so we have to recycle that so that we can bring people together , we have to deal with a lot of emotional conservation , and then we have to deal with very little sensitivity .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re going to tell us something about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was in the movies business of my parents , and then he moves away from the screen , so that &apos;s why these two things were affected .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so it &apos;s just that everything can be done can only be done with your mind .
Julie Sung : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just one of the big guys at the age , and you came up with the idea of a really tough job .
Julian Sanging : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a recovering operator from a very young age .
I wrote an email , and I found that at that time , when I was attacked by this crime .
That &apos;s why you need to use the word to read .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at that time , it &apos;s only Russian mafia that can support your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
For this word , it &apos;s not a word that has been used before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re running a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things that have helped them survive ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But primary value : well , good , hard people don &apos;t generate impact ; they grow .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and healthy people who live in my life .
Chris Anderson : Can &apos;t possibly be a powerful and healthy person to raise them ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a junior man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing a chicken , but somehow — there &apos;s another way to grow a chicken , which is approaching the police .
And this is what I have in my office for many , many years .
Chris Anderson : So we just got to the last bit and just said : What happened in the last year ?
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then the newspaper there has been a huge violation of storytelling .
Instead , they gave you the opportunity .
So you &apos;ve been very familiar with this in the West Bank . What happened ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
Ace Linda left an economic crisis .
There was the highest .
The banking sector grew tenfold , the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year .
And the state of the art in Taylor Vinci just five minutes before he was published , like a movie : &quot; The state of the art of anti-Semitic was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the web , time-consuming all the time , and we &apos;re getting very famous in Asian leaders , I went to Asian and talked about this problem .
And these were the elements of people over there that shouldn &apos;t be again , and as a result , the six-year-olds of the United Nations , working with some other international engineers , we lobbied for a new type of Asian Finance law , so this was such a Freedom Media facility , such as the most safe place for journalists all over the world , bringing about new Nobel Prize .
A nation like the North Atlantic right whale is heading up in the lower system .
And a month ago , the Paralympics of the East Land looked at it accordingly .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look to the future , do you realize that the most expected thing to show is power and power , greater security , or do we observe the power of equity , or does it leave the most ?
Julian Sanging : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure for the law of freedom and the law of transparency in the world — in Europe , in China and in the U.S.
What &apos;s the context ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live — because with a small effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : Well it seems to me that I &apos;m translating the message of audiences , it &apos;s called , the Juliet , with respect , and all the power to you .
Juliet Sung : Thank you , Chris Anderson : Thank you . ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching both .
So I did this , which is milkweed .
I was walking through my childhood connectome , and I was watching these videos go by .
When I was growing up and I came back home in the early 1990s , I had this epiphany .
My team stepped aside .
And when I looked at it from a personal point of view , I somehow realized how the rest of the world was thinking about it ?
And when I went to the Middle East , wherever I was going to be shocked to North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or Indonesia , every time I went to bed , I saw four creatures saturated by minerals — cold , silver , silver and code .
And I thought this was a big strange thing , and I was surprised to find out whether someone else was going to get the touch of this curve .
And when I discovered this , I realized that people are not watching their cartoonist team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Continuing the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human trait .
This work we did 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the oil data from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s very rare and disturbing , you &apos;ll think of all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , cow , wheat and wheat .
It &apos;s also true of strangers .
If you look at mine 150 or 200 years ago on New York City streets , you will see images like soap , concrete and rain .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of maggots , cows , but also maneuvers .
It understands that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shake .
This is a brand new problem .
We &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The Second World War gave us the greatest incentive to be strong .
In the midst of the Great War , we increased technology , like snow , polymer , etc . , and all of those things dropped off .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see the greatest increase in the capacity of catastrophe .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that military and Soviet societies have been increasing , and in a two-year period , they have been increasing numerically .
Now if you collect the forest flows and the forest flows every year , it would be equivalent to two China per year from the oceans .
Now , my favorite example of using Chinese cartoonists is not the only thing , because China is not the largest single country , but it &apos;s also the largest emitter .
So now they turn to their square legs .
The first biscuits in the U.S. and the West are the most utilized salt food .
The forest floor is an extraordinary source of prosperity .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , or 15 pounds of forest to get to market .
Language , getting to market , is an unbelievable standpoint .
In a study done in Delhi University , it showed that methane with gas is absolutely ineffective for methane ventilation .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That in the remote areas of the camps , those are the mangroves .
Now look at these nice little boys .
It tracks the footprint of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere to protect the beaches , the lakes , the wildlife refugees , all sorts of important things for the environment .
For many years , this happened with the civil war in Managua .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of coal plants .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Mark Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; the Nemo Club . &quot; &quot; Even though you &apos;ve been looking at the Tropical River , it &apos;s very controversial .
Today , some people are lying straight from the bottom , but with a very large number of them , they collect the other shrimp , and then they change in their diet .
And a lot of times , working with the slums , which are named after the Red Brigades , the slime mold , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means changing it in fresh food , which means that the ecosystem is feeding on itself and making it cool .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global icon .
You have to look at very large areas to organize as small as possible .
We &apos;re in our area , as scientists call it , the International Monetary Architecture , or the ICCAT — the International Committee for Refugee Effects Train .
Carl Shepherd put up a great adventure about all technology .
We can make mountains fun , but it &apos;s not good for the tuna fields .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s warm .
It can span over 40 miles a gallon and heat up to 20 degrees above ambient temperature .
All of the waste from this melting process is coming down .
Flowers contain blood vessels that don &apos;t last long .
This is the best for proteins .
But what was surprised by the Foreign Olympics was that they couldn &apos;t stay in the forest .
And time has been good enough , it doesn &apos;t have to be bad enough .
This is my political connectome .
Connect was running through the forest floor .
If you look at the map of the connectome , each dot is a dot .
In the policy of connectedness , there are 3,000 of them .
In fact , I say connectome is mostly people . ( Laughter ) If anyone has the power of a connectome , I think we can make the world a lot better .
And all over the place , these are the rockets that propel the vehicle for children to see .
As a result , we have a success story on the horizon and the temporal lobe .
When the space shuttle began , there were six pounds of forest floor to create a foundation for Sami .
But now it &apos;s a lot better .
On the contrary , it &apos;s also a little bit false , because if you look at the Freeman &apos;s Facebook page , they call it the keyboard instead of a Facebook page .
Whereas the feedback loops are thrown away .
It &apos;s hard to say something about parallel and parallel .
But then again , the credit card industry promotes that it &apos;s led to the cutting edge of reverse Phood Stims .
This is a system that is producing cooking , and it &apos;s being produced by Titan .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent years .
Even though we &apos;re spending a little bit less money to get to market , we &apos;re also spending a lot of money .
We &apos;re not just eating milk ; we &apos;re eating milk and eggs .
We have what &apos;s left and what &apos;s left .
Because the blood and hands on it are picking up and giving it a breath .
I &apos;m surprised what else he did , and what he did was he opened the door .
It &apos;s India first or dead . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking already about 30 million tons of wildlife products that have been taken out of the oceans .
This is the third component of China , or the average American , that comes out of space every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
The Philippines actually started lying .
And it started with a local banker noticing that the next day , the next group , they would never be on a microwave .
He grabbed hold of his hand and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s take a look .
What was more likely to be a pendulum for the summer was evidence that Ebola did not die .
So he created his lift song .
Unfortunately , it was 30 cents .
He wanted to make a 25-centimeter probe , so he formed the Atlantic Code .
For example , the Polaroque Sandwich , which is the largest mass-world art industry in the United States , moves from two to three billion pounds per year to three pounds per capita .
If we stop polluting the policies , then perhaps Tehran .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plastic proteins in very efficient ways in animal proteins , and it &apos;s hurting me for the third world .
It &apos;s actually a very solvable solution that &apos;s coming out of an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It &apos;s not like its fragile shape .
It doesn &apos;t have either the IPO and the DNA that we think will live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
This represents a large sample of three million tons .
One possibility is that conservation policies have enabled us to eat it ?
Can we get this to justify instead of giving .
There are reasons for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace where the average elite is at the top of the mouth compared to the needle and the effect is at the top of the Indus Valley .
This is amongst the top three , the EPA and the DNA .
So this is her ability .
But what if we took this path and instead of giving it a few dollars or a few pounds or a few pounds and turned it into a foot , we simply cropped the leather forest and cleaned the leather forest for two dollars ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homework is characteristic .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
The Indus calculus is incredibly efficient .
The Indus tradeoff for meat is only three parts .
Actually , the average person comes out of three .
Space Ocean builds up three vertices in the middle , so they just come together .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algae world , we &apos;ve been eating chemicals because of the use of phosphorus and nitrogen .
Over the past 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been born , and that &apos;s why the oceans die so much .
As you can think about the movies , in all these different conditions , proteins and , above all , are highly effective signals .
It &apos;s absolutely essential .
And the last mile is a question mark .
We can produce a facility that can prove us that safe proteins are beneficial .
This creature needs to be green , has the ability to grow fast and change its environment in a way that will be shaped like a chicken , and it needs to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Fate East .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I say this , nothing says to me , it says , &quot; &quot; We can do this all . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try to do that .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , then the third component of the world &apos;s population is about 30 million in the oceans .
I mean , this is all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I had to develop the big brain because I have a brother who is dying of mental illness .
More or less , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I can connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams come true ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they disconnect their dreams in public and in shared reality , and they act on it .
So I stopped looking for intense mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked at the President Frankenstein Bank , which was in the hallway of Harvard University .
So what were the answers to the metabolic level , to the brains of people who generally imagine analogies to their brains , versus their brains of Scottish , schizophrenia , or B.C. , were actually trying to engineer the microbial records of the brain , whose cells were sending the message , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the chemical involvement , &quot; &quot; and the amount of chemical involvement ?
So I had a lot of privilege in my life because I was doing this research on the day , &quot; &quot; but maybe on a weekly trip to NASA &apos;s one-week vacation .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself in the middle of September 10th , with an intellectual address .
I had a sleeping bag on the left of my brain .
And for the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely disoriented by any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and recall in the morning of college .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from one another .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that &apos;s touched with the left part of the brain , and this is what &apos;s going to happen to me .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely separate from each other .
For those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain is operating like a parallel processor , where the left part of our brain is operating like a neural processor .
These two pieces are transmitting messages with each other through the cross-section of the crossword puzzle that some 300 volumes have .
But apart from that , they &apos;re both very random .
Because they think about information in a different way , each part has a very different understanding of the information , their mind has a different set of things , and you let me just let you know who their personalities are very different from each other .
Thank you very much .
AB : Yes , there &apos;s more .
( Laughter ) The evidence for our brains is only now and think about that moment .
Here , at the moment , we &apos;re thinking about images of our brain , and it &apos;s organically thinking about the movements of our body .
Information spreads in the form of energy and storms throughout our entire system through neuroscience , and then it decreases into a giant almond-shaped classroom that , in the current moment , tells us what the current emotion is and what the mind is for and what it is for .
I am an energy geared from the energy of my surroundings through the consciousness of the left brain .
We are the brains of energy that are transmitted from one another through the consciousness of the left brain in a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers and sisters on this planet who are making the world a better place .
And at that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is scientifically and theoretically thinking .
The spirit of the left of our brain is about matter and future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that we take the largest aluminum / cloud we have today , and we begin to collect data and then collect data .
And it also informs organization and empowerment of all of the things that are going on in the past that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of tomorrow , namely , the impact of our projects .
The left-hand part of our brain is thinking in language .
It &apos;s this constant conversation that is bringing us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a tiny little voice that tells me how to buy your way home from work .
I need them in the morning . It &apos;s a sense of pursuing my computational book that reminds me of the book I read .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , &quot; I am ! I am ! &quot;
And as my left brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I am becoming a separate faith .
I become one of the only people around me with the energy and the fire around you .
And the only part of my brain that morning happened was the colonoscopy .
The morning of the Cold War , my left eye slammed into the back of my eye with a stick of pain .
It was suffering from some sort of trauma , like some kind of trauma .
And that pain just dragged me and left me .
And then they stopped and left .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never experienced any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No , nothing , I start my daily work . &quot; &quot; So I went to sleep and I put on my cardboard poster which is a previous physical exercise machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , because it feels like my hand is the finger of a primary human being that touched the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Whoa , this is the most bizarre and poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I &apos;ve been changing my mind , which is the general sense of being a human being , which is coming out of this experience , but now I &apos;ve been a mysterious and mysterious place where I &apos;ve been
And it was all very strange and poor , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started to walk in the room , and I felt like everything inside my body was so simple .
And the number is very difficult and very thinkable .
I have no connection to my airplane , and I think there &apos;s a housing problem , so I &apos;m just focused on the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my bedroom reading underwater , and I &apos;m actually speaking inside my body .
I heard a voice that was saying , and my father has to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then my balance goes down , and I roll down the wall .
I look around and I see my hands , and I realize that I can &apos;t repair my body &apos;s emotions now .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand and my hand were taken over by atoms and molecular walls .
If I understood something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my brain quietly silenced .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s voice from Romo &apos;s rectum .
A gift .
Before that , I was surprised by the absence of my brain .
But then immediately , the energy that came into the box in this huge space that was all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt the enormous grief and power of my body .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a blood vessel came into my brain and he said to me , &quot; You must have a lesion . &quot;
So we need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really sick of any problems . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really in love with this problem , but I &apos;ve come back to this kind of awareness of what I &apos;m calling a lot of money .
But it was a beautiful place .
Think about it in places that are beautiful where you &apos;re completely tied to this tiny brain that &apos;s killing you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere that I work and I &apos;m pushing harder on .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And look at all the relationships that come from the outside world and from that point of view were somewhat missing .
And I felt a sense of peace and compassion .
And think about what it would look like if you went back over the last 37 years from whatever emotional weight you &apos;ve been doing .
( Laughter ) Oh , I sort of set up a vocabulary .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain got to the left side of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Ah , wow !
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should be able to help with this , so I went back home and I bought myself a sanitary pad and now I &apos;m walking through my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , can I drive my car ? &quot; &quot; And this moment my hand was completely broken .
It occurred to me at that time that my God was attacking me , and the thing that my mind was telling me is how amazing it is .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s cool .
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who has the opportunity to realize that they can consciously contract their brain , and that &apos;s inside of them . ( Laughter ) Then one blood comes to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very nervous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time for birth . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the fighting of golf , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal role . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my first job , and then I remembered that I had a worksheets card with my phone number .
I then go to my studio room and I open up a three-inch card .
And I look at the top card , although I can see from my mind &apos;s eye clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s my card , because I don &apos;t see any of the points .
And the words on the page were held by the markings and the markings and I wasn &apos;t doing anything .
And then I started waiting for him to tell me the story .
And at that time , the public intersected again with the fact that it &apos;s not a card , it &apos;s not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to break even one inch .
And at that time , the effects of the one-fifteen season were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t have a way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I took a jewelry card , and I put it here , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the phone and I look at the little jewelry faces .
But then I picked myself up to the front lines when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember I had that number that I didn &apos;t have .
So I raised my hand like a Danish , and I put my hand on the floor with my other hand , and I immediately comforted these two hands that when I came back to the public realm , I can tell you that I left India for a while , and I ended up walking all over India , and I heard that the phone rings on the phone , and one of my friends raised my hand and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow .
I then say to him , &quot; I &apos;m speaking clearly in my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And from me , the voice ringes , something like , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language at the time , and I couldn &apos;t understand until I tried to speak .
So he understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And a long time later , in one of the ambulances , Sierra Leone was running down from Boston to another Massachusetts General .
I walked away like a toddler .
Just like a poor kid who had just gotten out of the house and got out of the poor , I pulled the energy out , and I was feeling helpless .
And it occurred to me at that moment that I &apos;m not prepared for my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or gives me a chance to transition .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I still live .
When I felt ashamed of my spirit , I said , &quot; &quot; I have saved my life .
Now my brain was capable of two different facts .
At that time , the emotion of my emotional system started to come to me just feeling suffocated by pain .
Light shined my brain like the fire in the forest , and the lights were dim and dim , that I was not hearing a sound , or I was not hearing a sound , and I was only heading a meltdown .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture , so I felt enormous and wide open like someone who was free from their belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant wheel in the middle of nowhere .
The Great Depression .
It brought me to the quality of what it means .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I could find my great awe to uncover the existence of this small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought in neurons .
And if I &apos;m brought in neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is , it can get neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world that is fueled by people with beauty , transparency and love , who know that they can sometimes feel that quality .
And they can choose to live and choose , and that &apos;s the right thing to do , is to pull the books off the left side of their brain and to search for transparent quality .
And then I understood how great this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of poems that taught me how to live my life .
And he gave me the privilege of healing .
After the violent crash , the southern hemisphere radiated the blood vessels from my brain equivalent to a vulture hitting the brain &apos;s weapon center .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real desire in my life .
I &apos;ve been healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life with the hand of hand and two very good brains .
And we have the power to choose whenever we are in the world and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step in the right part of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe ; I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful cell types of molecular matrix are found in one form , one in which everything is .
Or I can choose to step back to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a tiny way .
Quantum coherence .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
What would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And who ?
I think as long as we spend our left-hand cortex hauling down the electrical current in our right brain , we &apos;ll be able to free the world and make our planet more prosperous .
And I thought , you know , we need to break this idea .
Thank you .
( Applause )

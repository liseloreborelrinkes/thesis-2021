Good morning !
You guys are here ?
They called my name the Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the Tiger in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , as a young man , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was eating .
So I asked myself , &quot; &quot; Do you have any food in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Right ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslim . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minneo , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minneo . &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; And he said .
He was talking to me about three people , as his wife said , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A Lebanese teenager took two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can he speak like this ?
And that &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got angry about it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s wrong with me in my country ?
Where could that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I have many people like me who are walking to a circumstance in their lives , who are literally letting go of whatever is in their mind , just because they love words and are loved .
Should I embrace my culture , embrace imagination , opinions and opinions ?
We may have the most important battle savings in the stories of children .
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
How does this make sense ?
Although , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for him , as he did for me .
The Arabic language does not ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of Science , or the research , or the language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use in the workplace , the language that we relate to when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use to translate our data .
If we do that , they will cover our pockets .
So where can I use it ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But another more important fact that we need to think about .
The Arabic mother tongue .
Research says that in other languages , we need to translate our mother tongue into other languages .
In other languages , the primary language for creativity is the language of mother language .
How ?
Jewish cells , when he first started writing , exploited Arabic .
All of their thoughts , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in the car where he grew up , felt a certain kind of happiness , sounded a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their texts in English , they felt so happy , they felt the same sense .
Now , you can imagine that this is also their teaching in English , this little girl who was sitting in front of a boy in a hot shower .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are affordable .
Germany , France , Japan and China are all in place .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in their wallets , they spend a lot of money on the expansion of Venezuela .
Do we know better ?
All right , we &apos;re not from the emerging world , this emerging mindset is not even reaching us yet , and we want to reach this emerging world .
They were countries like ours at a time , but decided to try to grow , study , and move to countries like land , like employees and so forth , they laid down their tongue in the same way that girls were raising , like Hurricane .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you &apos;re a product and you &apos;re a product and you &apos;re not written on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these continents , not in conflict , as we are most of the time .
So for new inventions and inventions , they needed to maintain their language .
If I said , &quot; &quot; Conduction , autonomy , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will you remember ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and how .
Languages are not just about talking , words are just about us .
Language is a sign of a certain set of levels of our lives , and the words that are consistent with our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Congratulations , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special pattern in your brain , a special feeling for a particular day in a particular history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea that we think about , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our brain ?
How are you going to understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereign , independent , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes up to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the time of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t look at a problem , I &apos;m better off , and I don &apos;t spend any time talking about it .
It &apos;s that these impacts remind us of a particular thing .
My friend is a French speaker who &apos;s a French speaker .
Once upon a time , he was listening .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I promised his husband to try and translate what he meant to be &quot; &quot; reconciliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A woman named the word &quot; &quot; reconciliation , &quot; &quot; and then , over the course of the night , he tried to understand it .
And he was thinking , how can one really make a difference ?
Does she want to make herself ?
Bury me . ( English ) ( Cheers ) This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his husband , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; the way he thought about it was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listened to me , and one night , I tried to translate it into what I felt when I heard February . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate it , &quot; &quot; I raised my hand and why you did . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you did , I left my hands and I left you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
It translates . It shows me .
( Applause ) So what about the Arabic language ?
We transformed it into a way of thinking about society , and we started a conversation in Arabic .
As many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Hold it up , hold it up . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language forces a message , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because , like , we didn &apos;t understand it .
And if anyone says to me , I am bored from Arabic .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be confident in a way that reflects our dreams , our aspirations and our daily lives .
It &apos;s how we feel and how we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the East , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; And the right sign is the right sign .
Very easy , but very efficient .
After that , we started another tree with the landscape of the letters on the Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example from outside , an organization in which the letters of the black and the blue are in the back of a t-shirt , with this message , &quot; Kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Indeed , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we would have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We need to search for our existence .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And this opportunity to create new and new opportunities for compassion .
Later , we took pictures of boys and girls before the Arab script .
Cole images of boys and girls .
We are very coal !
And if anyone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; No ! I did the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to make as many arguments as two , but I &apos;m going to tell you the word that &apos;s great and the same is true .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these aren &apos;t museums ! We shouldn &apos;t hurt ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to let anybody grow up , or that we &apos;re going to have the right to speak up for us , to press ourselves , or to interpret our patients and to think .
Our idea has to be created .
So if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t refine the skeleton or anything , we can still be creative .
At this time , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Only once again can we find ourselves on a global scale .
He can repeat the Arabic language on the front lines .
Well , it doesn &apos;t know that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we need to know this , and we need to think that the solution is there , part of the solution .
What can you do today ?
Who here is Twitter ?
For Judaism , I recommend you , though , my time is over , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the data , you don &apos;t write Arabic with the letters of Latin .
( Applause ) This is speech ! This is not a language .
You will enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We are here to interest in the need of this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , speaks in a language of her father .
When my daughter is born , I don &apos;t believe him , &quot; &quot; This is your father , right . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; ( This is your age , honey , &quot; &quot; and I promised my daughter that in the marketplace , if she said to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . ( Arabic ) &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mama , &quot; &quot; it won &apos;t happen .
And it &apos;s not going to be predictable that no one &apos;s going to get old . ( Applause ) You get the cultural press . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to say it to us , to remind us that we are not a miracle of our existence , I was the one with the negative fathers who are protecting my people , only when you see my generation without the bank , I &apos;m tired of this generation of inequality , so it &apos;s not our generation that &apos;s not known for our generation until they become famous for our ethnicities , how much
( Applause )
My favorite pie is the data .
In college , my primary denominator was a vegetable , which meant I had multiple signatures .
Now a regular person , when they write something , will have something to do with it .
You know ... ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll start your work smaller , but last week you &apos;ve done a lot of work and more work after that , everything &apos;s done , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My answer would be all sorts of things , but in fact , the texture would start on its head , and then something like that will happen .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every textbook .
And then there &apos;s this whole research paper that you do in a year .
And I knew that my common practice wasn &apos;t an option .
It was a very big task .
I set up a plan , and I decided I would do something like this .
This is what it &apos;s going to look like .
I &apos;m going to start out small , in the middle months , the workforce is going to increase , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it more like a student .
How hard is learning going to get ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Come on , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we redesigned a big project .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then the river would get dressed , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two weeks went by , two weeks went by .
And then one day I went and there was three days in the DC , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , and I wrote 90 pages , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , two streets , three streets , two streets of human traffic , one branch in the Cambodia ,
I thought , now it &apos;s over .
One week later , I got a call and he was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tommy ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk to the dad . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;m going to see you today , that &apos;s the best one . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe it . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be happy with that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write a blog , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the system .
My roommate constantly gives me six people and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my guess was that the brain stem is made differently than six people .
To find out that I made a leaf where I could look at other brains like these and see the evidence for the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look away and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not very expensive , but consider it .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
There are hundreds of decisions in both brains , but the stereotypical brain is quite entertaining .
Now what does this mean in terms of a system ?
That means everything &apos;s fine when it doesn &apos;t .
&#91; Going to work is the best time &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart people will make decisions to make sense of something , but they don &apos;t like this project , so they &apos;ll send the commands , and they say , &quot; &quot; Keep your handwriting on the page . &quot; &quot; Nancy and Tony Hadfield , because I know this is still happening .
( Laughter ) So â€” ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;ll get to the stage , and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , beginning with a conversation about the theme of Richard Finland , and much later , it will end up seeing the mothers on the Internet .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to take a while on these things , so it won &apos;t take any time to do something today .
What &apos;s the deal ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the kind of thing that you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present .
It &apos;s not a matter of the future , it &apos;s just two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s fine .
If you can and you spend your entire life going further and further , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Good nutrition , good thought , and increasing generation , in the long run , maybe that &apos;s what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not too far away .
We are an increasing threat , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a smart person to decide , that we can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are remotely isolated .
We make big projects .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is to figure out how to do it when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes they seem to be the right thing to do that which is easily and emotionally friendly to eat , to think or to feel comfortable with emotions of opportunity .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s a shame .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big cause .
And this is a clue .
And for the sixth-graders , this tendency is always to finish in a way that spends more time in the small class , a simple and permanent path that has been out of the wall for centuries .
I call it a special place .
( Laughter ) The dark areas are places where the Sisters are extremely familiar .
There is a dream when obesity is not supposed to be a romance .
In the dark region , what you find is no longer a hot spot , because it &apos;s not a right , it &apos;s a sense of abuse , of fear , of anxiety , and itself , it &apos;s all the qualities that are in the right order .
The question is , in this way , when the invention is broken , how does the system manage to intervene in the nucleus , which is a lesser but important place ?
The evidence is that systems are also supported by conservation people , who are protecting it all the time in their particular spaces â€” somebody said to him at home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household which is more familiar , but when David Lynn gets near , it &apos;s a wonderful wake-up call or then when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the building only works .
Now I had this connection in my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Apparently I did .
I had a dream job at TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something in my brain that defined humanity .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going on in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; And the publisher said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the Indian map at the lower 2,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house till we see Sarah , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , and a month later , people at TED decided to name the Koran .
I opened the web up and it was a picture of me holding my breath .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house that was built , and within seconds the entire system was on fire . ( Laughter )
And he remembers ... he &apos;s afraid of the house â€” he rolls down the tree !
And finally , and finally , the smart decision maker picked up the pen and I could start talking .
Now the homework that explains that every category of cross-pollinator pumps , like me , someone like me would give two weeks to a murderer , and the beginning of the session is not going to be written , and then amazingly , the unbelievable tools of the process take place all night and write them down .
And the total three of them â€” they call the system of the senior people .
That &apos;s not very good for anyone .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised at the impact of it .
In fact , I &apos;ve got thousands of miles of products all over the world , from people , from different backgrounds .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and even ACEs .
( Laughter ) And nearly one thing was telling and saying , &quot; I &apos;m totally alone . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and the number of emails .
In the tradition of these people , he was listening to the mythology of how much Shepherd boy talked about in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay ! If the system is right , then what happens ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out the system is two equations .
Today , I gave examples , all of which were about subjects , all of which were David Lynn .
And when David lines up , recently , the effects of this are crucial because the household is reaching out .
But there &apos;s another dimension to the system , and it &apos;s not about any data line .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like some art or business â€” like some art or commerce , when you don &apos;t start designing yourself to follow things , to do things .
In addition to doing so , there are many things that David Lynn cannot confront , such as having with his family , having to exercise , understanding your health , understanding your relationships , telling your relationships that you should not care about .
Now , if the only way to do the job is to hire the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services , it &apos;s hard , because all of the data that &apos;s built on the ground floor is lost .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with us .
And this is a classic low-end title , which has to do with much less observation , and much less to do with respect to more than just deadly , ambiguous basic assumptions .
You &apos;re running out of luxury data .
And this can become a currency of the Taliban and the rebellion .
So I thought , this is why they &apos;re emailing , and this is why they &apos;re in the street .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban recruited them , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and one thing came out â€” I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of us in the audience have good relationships with Linux , but remember the paths when David Lawn wasn &apos;t there .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many boxes , especially when some of them are expensive .
And I think we all need to be careful with this curator .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing , because in every single life , there &apos;s no time for anyone .
We need to be careful .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have an individual house there , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eight days in the U.S. and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan was stumbling from one area of Afghanistan to one area of Afghanistan , to help provide an office to the Afghan government to help provide an office to protect the jobs of Afghanistan , to help provide an enforcement to provide a fund to the Afghan government to help provide a funding for the Afghan government to help
He came in at the end of an attack , and he lived around three , and with a lot of things , he watched as a child by the Cape Town as a child , he watched as a child by the Cape Town as a child to save the wives and get the dead .
One of the people who knew her children , one of the guards , and one of the guards of Spain , was pushing towards a helicopter , and one of the guards of Spain , was pushing towards a helicopter .
What this shows is that the clearance of Cape Synthine and Isaac are replacing this greenhouse gasoline .
They brought them to the helicopter and then you see what the Cape Town can do , and they paid them before they could save others .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a lovely one , and I knew why I work with people that aren &apos;t .
You know , at the end of the day , people who want to sacrifice themselves in order to benefit others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who want to sacrifice others so that we can benefit .
We have an electrical calculation !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they go to the forest .
These are the best people to pursue this imagination of services , and these are the best people to pursue this imagination .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a habitat , and if you have a temperate environment , each of us has the ability to work together , so each of us has the ability to compete with one another and increase the ability to do that in others .
I have an honor to share with some of these people , and we will say yesterday , I have an honor to share with some of these people , and we will say yesterday , and they have given their knowledge to save others , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The hard thing about believing and cooperation is that they are emotions , not humans .
It can &apos;t be that you say , &quot; &quot; Stop me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I put two people together and they do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this emotion come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago to the Beatles , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of dangers , these are all powerfully focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Dreadnoughtus can be short of wasted resources , a rapid metric , all of which are working together to reduce our lifespan , all of which are working together to reduce our lifespan .
And therefore , we were ready in the form of social animals where we were together and acting together as part of what I call a spirituality , as in a neighborhood where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we felt reassuring and collaborative .
It has continuous benefits .
That means I can sleep at night and I can sleep at night and see some dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t engage in each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t engage you , it means you don &apos;t look at your risks .
It &apos;s a big system for the rest .
The new landscape is exactly the same .
This world has to do with risks like things that are trying to make our lives difficult , or trying to reduce our success , &quot; &quot; Our opportunities are trying to reduce our success .
This can be a society that can scale beautifully by the stock market .
It could be a new technology that you can take your business class off at night , and it could be a new technology that can take your business class off at night .
Or it could be your opposite , which sometimes tries to fight you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s driving your rise and trying to drive your businesses to get you there , and it &apos;s trying to get your rise and your businesses to get you there .
We don &apos;t have any authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the action is , because that &apos;s where the leadership is .
When a leader chooses to preserve the lives of the people in her organization and their lives to protect the people in her organization and protect the lives of the people in her organization , and that they sacrifice their own personal and sincere results in order for people to stay alive and sincere results in order to make people feel secure and feel their personal relationships , so that they can compromise things .
I was traveling on a new journey , and I realized a fact that when a passenger had tried to step in before he had found it , and I saw the staff on the door that he was walking by himself like he passed the law as I knew it .
The first time I tried scuba diving on it , the first time I tried scuba diving on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you using things like force ?
Why can &apos;t you work with us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he came up to me with exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we study the journey in the West Bank with us is not because they &apos;re giving lentils to better people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give their own leaders .
You see that if conditions are present , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves against each other , we spend our time and our strength protecting ourselves against each other and therefore less organization .
What a great leader does , and I can give you the most recent example of what a parent like to be a parent is a great leader for her , and I can give her the most recent example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it is necessary , we want to give our children the opportunities , the education , the discipline , when it is necessary , to make them grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s exactly what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , when they need it , they want to give their people opportunities , education , theory and record , when they need it , they want to create confidence , they want to give them the opportunities to be past and fail so that they can achieve more success that we &apos;ve ever imagined so that they can achieve more successes than ever imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Yump , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company called Next Yump in New York City , says one thing : If your family &apos;s hard time , do you ever take away your kid ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has actually lost control of customer service . Charley has essentially lost control of customer service .
If you &apos;re a Next Yump employee , you don &apos;t get a job based on effective problems .
But if you have a problem , they will lead you and help you , just like we would do to a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why some people are particularly upset and upset , some of the bankers who are CEOs , and that &apos;s why they have so much anxiety and distress , some of the bankers who are leading CEOs , and that &apos;s because they have so much anxiety and distress , some of the bankers who are sitting in the CEO who are unequally upset and more stressed .
This is not data .
But they &apos;ve evolved the fundamental principles of gravity .
They have grown a vibrant social society .
We know that they have given their loved ones the victims of their loved ones , and we know that they have given their loved ones the victims of their loved ones , but they say they have given their loved ones to their loved ones , and they say they have convinced their loved ones to their loved ones .
It &apos;s something that compares to us , not data .
Can any of these compare to paying the garden for 150 million dollars ?
Why haven &apos;t we given teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problems with that ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save data .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to save data .
But they &apos;ll give people the latest amount of data to save , but they &apos;ll give people the latest amount of data to save .
Baby Chapper Media , who runs a miniaturization company in Baby Chip Media called a miniaturization company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , who was a senior trader in 2008 , and they employed 30 percent of their daughters every night .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very big problem , and they cannot afford to buy more of their farmers .
They needed 10 million dollars in children , so many of the companies that you have now come together and do a random procedure .
And Bob answered that .
You can see the bus is not trusting .
It &apos;s also believing in the generation of babies , and reducing conditions is much harder and harder to reduce disease .
And then they created a schedule .
That every job , from the computer to the CEO , would have to put everyone in a small four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted to and they didn &apos;t have to do that .
But as Boob declared the program , he stays very important .
He said , it &apos;s better that we all get bigger decisions , that some of us get a lot more money and suffer as much as that .
That &apos;s how they &apos;ve saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you can expect , when people feel protected from the dignity of an organization , trust and cooperation is understood .
And in a way that no one would have expected , people started businesses from each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful families .
That is , some people took five volumes to make each other just three volumes .
Gravity is not an exception .
I know many people who benefit from organizations &apos;s highest hierarchy , and I know many people who benefit from the highest range of organizations who are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateurs , and we do what they say because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know many people across the organization who don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the right to see the person , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the right to look at the person , and they &apos;ve had the right to look at the person .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the technologies that were going on out in the kitchen , and as a way of technology , the way that technology is to eat in the back , and it &apos;s to eat your people first , and when it &apos;s done , it doesn &apos;t save anything .
And when he came back into the field , the men would give him some food from his food to eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We tell them they do it .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered by someone else , and we call them leaders because they &apos;re endangered by somebody else .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can protect them , we call them leaders , because they choose to be victims so that people can be safe and that people can benefit them , and when we do so , the primary responsibility is that our people will be saved .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and blood and blood to see their dreams become real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and your pancreas and your body to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us too . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re going to like to do everything ?
And isn &apos;t it the organization that we all love to do ? And isn &apos;t it the organization that we all love to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the story of a little girl named Mother-in-law on the side of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the water supply and the water supply is as unbelievable as the disease , and in these conditions , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up once every 17 years , I was staying quiet with my friends in the bush .
The sun is getting warmer in midair .
And as I was slowing down in the garden , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you invent something that just gets in the skin and doesn &apos;t need to touch you ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I need to buy this . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have the right water and sanitation .
Four hundred and fifty of them are in Africa , and there &apos;s only one in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is the most dangerous chromosome we call .
A diagnosis that &apos;s due to the loss of the eye of the chromosome is one of the most prolific pollutants that you can find on your own .
This disease affects millions of people every year on a continuous basis , and most of all , it &apos;s the only thing you have to solve for your trachoma : no density , no plants , no engineering .
After seeing the statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I took my brother &apos;s night out of the 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a web broadcast at the 20th percentage of
And I looked at this as a very special problem .
So what we said was right , our pheromones were ready .
Now we need to process this .
Four years later , and the mobile phone is 40 pages full of businesses on the phone , and after I &apos;m writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent in the country , and â€” ( &quot; &quot; Not Enough ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t say more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first glacier pollution .
You just lay it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to lay it down .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and finite resources , which I had , the Mayor Unit Administration entered some new people , did more of it , and now we have a full-blown model , which is ready for the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products much .
They &apos;re just buying under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket , they buy a ticket , they buy a ticket , because it takes more money .
So we put DryBath in these creative blocks .
You put it between the two and the outside .
And the most amazing thing is , one lake only exchanges a cake in five branches .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We also want DriBath , the expectant offspring â€” ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water every time it rained , and we could save two houses for children , which is two houses , more than two houses for school , more than two houses for school . Two more houses for the children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken away our key values of values , health and serenity .
DriBath is the service of a thriving man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re now in the process of setting this up , and we &apos;re actually injecting it into a range of multinational retailers to market it , and one question I &apos;m going to ask you today is , on the Limpopo Current , in one week , we &apos;re dealing with an ion of 50 brands that doesn &apos;t need to rent the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot in this recent process , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s earliest teenager .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to ever go to college , and one of the things that surprised me , and one of the things that keeps me busy about why I didn &apos;t want to do it . Thank you .
( Applause )
By the way , I &apos;m here today to share some of the results with you , and I was surprised to myself , what are the actual causes of success in organizations â€” which are actually why organizations are so successful .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you choose one group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find human potential which was previously impossible .
You will see them possible .
But if initial organizations are the best , why do the majority of them fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know a lot of organizations about this , and I wanted to share a lot of my ideas and misconceptions that came from some of the organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was a product founder of a 12-year-old Young Wayne school basketball player from Kandy to school , when I was making solar tools , then college , when I was making radio .
I graduated from college , I founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the iPod started , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve launched more than 100 companies , and many , many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to explain to you the greatest cause of organization success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think everything is .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; Idea Leaf &quot; &quot; which is the old lady that you feel about .
With interference , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to perceive or interfere , is even more critical .
I never thought it was going to be a TEDster , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Every person has a plan , until I have a plan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business as well .
It is critical for a team to recruit from car seats .
Machine is a reality .
So I thought maybe the team has the most important impact .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization make a clear illegal process ?
With it , it seemed to me that the most important thing for success was to grow up .
So think about investment .
Sometimes organizations make great investments .
Could it be the most important one ?
Of course after that â€” is it the right time ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world wasn &apos;t prepared for it ?
It &apos;s short , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is that right ?
Or so far , and before , are there many terrorists ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of respect in many organizations .
And 100 companies have launched Libya 100 companies , and 100 companies out there to try and find a scientific result .
So first of all , these ideas on laptops , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” these are all dollars of revenue .
And on the lower level , five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink â€” were very hopeful for us , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried typing all these letters as I thought these companies had moved on .
And then in computer science companies , I saw strange breakthroughs like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
A couple of failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Floose and Frindster .
There was a huge investment in other companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to learn that the greatest effect of all of these companies was success and failure , and the result struck me .
The first was the choice of time .
The right amount of time is 42 percent in the difference between success and failure .
The team and the students are on the second scale , and then they think , being different , they think , is really the third number .
But it &apos;s not really clear , it &apos;s not that the thought doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was surprised that I didn &apos;t think it was the most important thing .
Sometimes it becomes more important , when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business models and investment in my mind .
I think the commercial model still needs to be broken , because you can start with a commercial model , and then when customers are growing , you can include it .
And investment , if initially low investment , is now increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples of all of these noise polls .
Take the big success of Airbnb , as you all know .
It &apos;s famous that a lot of investors looked at this company because people thought , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put some of their houses on a ticket ? &quot;
Of course , it proved the wrong thing .
One of the reasons for the success of metrics is that the best business model , I think , and the market perspective , is the right time .
This company came in front of these financial problems when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people respond to protests in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best viewer .
But the time was absolutely right , make the money they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional support ; it was very critical .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed HIV .
Goto.com , which we published at TED in 1998 , was at a time when companies wanted to look at more companies .
We thought it was best , but in fact , the right time was probably more .
And then something failed .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so excited about it . With a lot of collateral and best marketing examination , we had to work with the giant Hollywood artists .
In May 1999 and 2000 , the broad web was very low .
It was so hard to watch that online video , you have to codify your browser and don &apos;t know what to do , and eventually this company started in 2003 .
Only two years later , when the problem of the curriculum was solved by Adobe Flash , and Brad Bond , over 50 percent in the U.S. , reached the highest time YouTube .
The best of times , I think .
The truth is that YouTube , when it started , had no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it would work .
But he chose the most extraordinary time .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
Think is very important .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if you &apos;re really ready for your wedding .
And the really convincing thing is , what the outcomes don &apos;t work , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but in terms of time , you have to work very safely .
As I said before , organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Some of them hopefully will be helpful to increase your success , and then it won &apos;t be helpful in other ways .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 April 3 , 2016 we saw the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; Final access to smart and powerful people &#93; &#91; cash flow among non-governmental companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve got to explain the Gulf Walters Initiative . &#93; &#91; This week , the center of the classroom was central to the Twin Towers compared to the Girl millions of
The funds that these papers were published were made out of the shell companies .
We get to know the inner stories of cars and banks and villages that come in and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see the email , you can see the text messaging exchange , you can see the way it works , how it works .
It &apos;s starting to show up .
The CEO of Eisenland is extremely famous .
We also have this news that the poor desecration companies are sitting behind barbed walls .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of stolen credit card details to the central mission of Russia to its child &apos;s friend , a famous Sistine .
And many brilliant people will be infected , and they will be at home with additional false papers .
Now this is a story of a magic film , or a novel by Jesus Christ .
What should we do about it ?
But the fact that grammar and power people are sitting in their pockets and they &apos;re not supposed to be taxed , meaning that effective actions like schools are less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , it &apos;s a surprising discovery .
The global media and political leaders are talking about how people in shell companies have their own influences â€” that we &apos;ve been thinking about for decades .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful , wonderful world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to think that these smart companies are working .
I think it &apos;s sort of like a bloody girl .
You can run a company inside a company , a company inside a company , and it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind the curtain .
For organizations ruled by law enforcement , it &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s happening .
And I think it &apos;s also interesting that in the United States , it hasn &apos;t been very much discussed .
Maybe it &apos;s not the case for famous Americans .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
That &apos;s why the U.S. Foundation campaign works , there are a few of them .
I think if we look at the inventions of the Kamen Air Land or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the refrigerator , the kind of thing that the U.S.
But a lot of American leaders don &apos;t have to give much information , and they need less information to run the company than they do in the library .
In schools in the U.S. , this information is given to students .
Ninety-seven fundraising companies get funded .
We all have an impact on this .
Now in the Gulf Vincent , we wanted to see how this machine worked .
How does it actually work ?
What we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve transferred a shell and transported it to the 13 cleaning companies of Manhattan .
Our footprint became an African minister , and he wanted to move to America for a household , a ship and a joke .
What was striking about the heart was that all the villages could provide a one-size-fits-all solution to how the village moves .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make any money , and we didn &apos;t pay anybody any money , but it got a bad idea of the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individual contracts .
It &apos;s not about individual well-being that has been talked to us about cheating and suggesting .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who was found in Sandille .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which protects electricity , fire , gravity and unemployment .
And in order to do that , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game to make it harder to produce .
It may be intuitive , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so people who are rich and powerful will always be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This issue was run on political issues , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Department covered in eight states that happened in South Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been forming a central record of the global commons , whether it &apos;s actually a European company or whether it &apos;s controlling it .
The evidence is that HIV is behind it .
Conflict law enforcement is different from the center and the center , which the growth we wanted was not high , so we were five .
They want to see the inventions , the larger sections of the larger companies , which are used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a change in the Gulf of Tunisia .
We need to reach out to the people who are familiar behind barber companies .
You know , they speak up , it &apos;s not good for adoption , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to encourage the legislative changes of information to be heard .
We can violate this separation by the secrets that are responsible for keeping track of the classrooms and the classrooms open .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lex , who invented your invention , has had much more sensation in the last few years than all the other media in the world .
Can this happen ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah , can it happen ?
It &apos;s a story about â€” isn &apos;t it ? â€” that the media of the world is showing ineffectively at least one small group of factors able to capture this kind of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does this happen ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you deal with them ?
Julian Sanguay : There we are . I can say it here . It &apos;s going to be public service in the right way , and we have so many ways to get information out to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed storage to get materials from one place online to another , to clear out the signals for law enforcement , like software and blogs .
We get information from data , from ordinary data , from Ross Square , or whatever , common news organizations like that , frame â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about giving massive information to people and then protecting yourself against illegal logic and political opinions .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is the key , but you actually never know what the scale is .
Julian Sanguay : That &apos;s right , we &apos;ve always been alive , and if we get caught up in a circle , we quickly release the information .
( Phones ) God makes it worse .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think it &apos;s kind of coming up here and asking what the TED wish is . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example : real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So this was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah , it &apos;s a Carl Report .
This was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Back in 2004 , the government had turned 18 .
She was a soldier in Kenya .
And when the book was empowered â€” because of the original powers that were trying to decide how scared the reputation was , they bought 20 million pounds of reputation for this report and so on .
And then the government was looking at it and using it against their political will , which was the most brilliant people â€” now the most enthusiastic people in Kenya .
This is Jesus for the president of Kenya .
That &apos;s why it was launched in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this by the very first election in December 2008 .
When we did that report , three days later , we decided to make a friend of the new president , Kabby , who was horrified by Daniel Arp , so this report went out and sat in the back of the closet .
CA : And â€” so , I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s that â€” it &apos;s happened in Kenya , not by the way of working , but by the way , and by the way , it &apos;s changed the result of your choice .
Julian Sangin : Yes . This is the headlines of Guardian and then in all of the 500 countries of Kenya , in the Newspapers of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he believed , after a couple of days , that Kenya &apos;s amazing invention could talk about it .
And this weighed on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the weather , according to a Chinese senior report , and it changed the result of that .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your secret view has actually changed the world ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re showing a little video of a little bit of a windmill .
It &apos;s just like that video . But here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This â€” I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-speed video .
RD : It &apos;s hot , when you first pick them up with two .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
The path is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your show , tell me . Come on .
All dollars .
Glass , clap !
( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running .
Hotel . Bess Masters : two , six , six .
We should move now , time is up !
Okay , now we &apos;ve got eight people in the arm .
Here we &apos;re looking at two Halloween posters , and we &apos;re still running vegetables .
Roger . They &apos;re on my show .
Two sides , two sides , we &apos;re on the roof .
Ah , what a contradiction . What happened ?
God bless you , Hell . Okay . Yeah , I took them .
CA : So what happened ?
Julian Sanguage : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people involved in this .
These were the first in three dimensions that happened in the case .
CA : So there were 11 people involved in this attack , right , two of the CEOs ?
Juliano Sanguage : Yes ! The two employees of Reuters , two small children were killed .
Overall , 26 people were killed .
CA : And after his execution , there was a lot of outrage .
What was the underlying reason for regret , you think ?
Julian Shanning : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as a very , very unequal force .
On the one hand , some people are walking in the grass , and then a kilometer away from the neighborhood , Hilly Copter starts pouring 30 kilometers of vegetables on each person â€” either of them â€” and gives birth to children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t any kind of victims , because they were conscious .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining was arrested , and he said that he had acknowledged in the Detroit Rome that he had shown you this video of 280,000 and white American documents as well .
Is that really what happened ?
Julian Sanguage : So we invented it by accepting the devices .
Five days ago , it was tried to get 150,000 pieces and 50 pieces .
But what we &apos;ve done now is we &apos;ve made it available at the beginning of the year in Rwanda and an American safety house , but there &apos;s no correlation between them .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of accessories to the U.S. safety house ...
Julian Sangley : We &apos;re giving them what we &apos;re going to do . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do ? ) Julian Sangley : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sangley : Because these kinds of things show that actually , right now , what the current state of Arab government is , these governments are actually violating human rights violations .
If you look at cave paintings , the material is inside them .
CA : Please play around with it .
I mean , normally what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right that you store hidden information ?
Julian Shanning : So the question is , how important information in the world is , what information can &apos;t repair .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that organizations spend money on , and it &apos;s a great indication that when they should be able to store information from the outside , they hope to do something good , because the organizations know better , and they know their stories , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks to this as an individual or a collective society , where you don &apos;t expect to be unexpected ?
Julian Sanguage : We didn &apos;t have the documents with them .
What I mean by that is that our great harm is action .
With information , we &apos;re able to capture in a particular way the kind of information that &apos;s being fed â€” the kind of information that &apos;s being fed through somebody else .
But there are also some mysteries â€” for example , your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret â€” but we &apos;re talking about these civic services that are coming on their way and being monitored for youth .
CA : OK , so they do it with emotion .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , who &apos;s a daughter in the United States taxi , who says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve had this effect that some people like to reach out to others .
It shows an American technology straight to dead people .
Which makes a difference â€” but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. is technical .
If they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? What are you going to say ?
Julian Sanguay : There are many questions like this .
But remember , in Iraq , people in Afghanistan â€” you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference to their opinions , it doesn &apos;t make a difference to their opinions .
Because that &apos;s where they all look .
It will transform their feelings and thoughts that will give us all the money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re looking at hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s great .
But doesn &apos;t it seem ridiculous to you that in order to solve this light , you have to maintain a kind of secrecy of your own imagination ?
Juliano Song : Not exactly . I mean , we don &apos;t have any different cells .
We have no idea what other minds are .
If they do that , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to increase the work later on .
CA : I think , what we &apos;ve heard so far is â€” this is where the innocent people come from .
You can also imagine that there will be different kinds of anger about the cause and the joy .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or the problem .
What is the point of view of Julius ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanguage : Oh ! You want to be there .
CA : There are a lot of great people out there , great .
We &apos;re going to try and do it . The forces are another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
Here &apos;s a very interesting story , which was old , right ?
What is this ?
Julian Shanning : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year â€” in November , a lot of important Russians were put in the banks , as in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report â€” which happened to be a very nice trial â€” which was said that , in fact , conservation agencies had been contradicted by companies who were running there and they were burning .
And there was something about the federal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing on the surface of this report , so it was a very difficult task for us .
We couldn &apos;t predict it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we were surprised that perhaps this company did all the opposite .
We put it on the ground , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t really know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and I look it right , but we can &apos;t predict it . &quot; &quot; And then one letter of the week that he wrote it , he wanted to figure out the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to figure out the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how legally you have money ?
Is this really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they took this brand that we looked at in Scratch with the name of the factory with Microsoft and DNA .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s one way of understanding and predicting what the materials are , and it &apos;s trying to write and achieve with these people .
CA : All right . So , any information out there from inside ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re bringing together several breakthroughs as we go through the hard process .
Our honor for this has been increasingly simple in several months , because we are improving our budget system because of this rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s raw .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s already playing , more of our capabilities are starting to stick with us because of our increased growth , and what that means is that we have public services in the number of public services that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have enough people to arrange and update this information .
CA : So that &apos;s a real problem , essentially , why are some recruiters or journalists aspiring ?
Julian Sanguage : Yeah . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to solve fast , because with the material we have to deal with , so we need to reinvent the organization so that we can get people together that we have to develop a lot of sensitivity about the materials of the commons , and then we have to be less aware of the issues .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re telling us something about yourself and how you came to this work .
And I think what I &apos;ve learned is that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that right ?
Julian Shang : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the neighborhood , so the two reasons were influenced .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so what I &apos;m saying is that everything can be done can be created by artificial intelligence .
Julie Shang : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were just one of the young adults , and you came up with this idea of working very quickly .
Julian Shanghai : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I &apos;ve been a journalist since I was very young .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time when I got married in this crime .
That &apos;s why you should respect the word .
I mean â€” there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian mafia that &apos;s using your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not the word that it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things that have helped them survive ?
Julian Sanguage : I don &apos;t believe it .
But the basic value : Okay , good , hard people don &apos;t generate masters ; they grow them .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brilliant and heavy people who live in my life .
Chris Anderson : Can &apos;t possibly be humans creating fruit flies ?
Julian Sangley : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a fisherman , so I &apos;m not very good at growing a vegetable , but somehow â€” there &apos;s another way of growing a fruit fly , which is approximately equal to police .
And this is the thing that exists in my office for a very long time .
Chris Anderson : So we just had this book recently : What happened in the last year ?
Basically what you &apos;ve done here is you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then you &apos;ve got the newspaper deterrent that keeps the story short .
Instead , they inspired your position .
You would be very famous in the OECD . So what happened ?
Julian Sanguay : Yeah , it &apos;s a great event . You know .
AIDS is a crisis .
Here it was .
The bank had grown to 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year .
And the common threat of Tilly Weigene just five minutes before it was published , like a movie : &quot; The endless presumption of the News Reader , and the state of Netizard was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming all the time , and we became very famous in the Iceland , I went to the Iceland and talked about this issue .
And these were the elements of the people over there that shouldn &apos;t be again , and as a result , the Asian scientists in the Netherlands , working with some other international Machines , we named an Asian Leand for a new kind of crime , so it &apos;s kind of like free media , the most protective space for journalists all over the world , to open a new Nobel Prize .
A North country like Ice Land is like a curve , so it &apos;s heading up the bottom of the system .
And one month ago , the Alice Land Paralympic organized it accordingly .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look at the future , do you think it &apos;s more expected to show power and power , greater security , or see us at all , or will it continue ?
Julian Shanghai : I don &apos;t believe where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to agree with the laws of liberty and the laws of transparency in the world â€” Europe , China and the U.S.
What &apos;s the context ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live â€” because with a small effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating listeners &apos; hearts into something called , geeks , with respect , and all the power to you .
Julian Sangley : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I worked absolutely in food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching both .
So I did this , which is milkweed .
I was watching my childhood Connecticut street , and I was watching these videos contract .
When I grew up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I got this email .
My team stood up .
And when I looked at it from a sort of personal point of view , I thought , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the Middle East , where I was surprised that North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or Indonesia , repeatedly prosecuted four species of organisms â€” good , dark , silent and code .
And I thought this was a big miracle , and I was amazed to see if anyone else had a virtue of this curriculum .
And when I found out about it , I realized that people weren &apos;t looking at the coalition team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Contradicting the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human quality .
We did this work 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , they &apos;re going to look at rocks and branches , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures like this .
But if you look at the order of 2,000 years ago , all you would see is four animals : soy , coal , wheat and wheat .
It &apos;s also true of being an extender .
You look at me on New York City &apos;s road probably 150 or 200 years ago , and you &apos;ll see cartoons , sticks and floors .
But if you look at the far remoteness , you &apos;re only going to be four years old , so wheat , herring , but also maneuvering .
It understands that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did this happen to us ?
Shah .
It &apos;s a brand new problem .
And we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The Second World War has given us a tremendous incentive to be strong .
During the Great War , we developed technologies such as sweatshirts , polymers , and so on and so forth , all of these things dropped out .
And since the end of the Second World War , I have come to see the greater potential of catastrophe .
But it &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the saltwater and the saltwater plant has increased , and within two years , its saltwater is increasing by total amount .
Now if you collect battlefields and battlefields , this will be the equivalent of two Chinese births every year from the sea .
My favorite example of cooking in China is not one case , because China is not only one of the biggest countries , but it &apos;s also the biggest embroidery .
So now they go to their four choices .
The first area in the U.S. and the West is the most utilized salmon food .
Government is an extraordinary resource .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , or 15 pounds of forest to get to market .
The Indus script also has an unbelievable level .
In a study done in Delhi University , it showed that gasoline sequestering emissions is extremely ineffective .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That the forest floor in the area of the bay is the Mongolian war .
Now take a look at these beautiful patterns .
They &apos;re putting the footprint of the Earth in their place , protecting the beaches , the harvest and the harvesting of the children of the hills , all important things to the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the Mongolian war .
Over the last 30 or 40 years , we &apos;ve eaten millions of coastal plants .
Another action that comes out of that is what the philosopher Marc Bentham calls &quot; &quot; the Nemo Code . &quot; &quot; Even on the Tropical River , you &apos;ve seen this very controversial thing .
What &apos;s happening today is that the little larger nest is falling off , but along with it , a very large number of other mites are falling apart and turning diet into food .
And many times it &apos;s been working with the slaves that are named after the Red Brigades , and it &apos;s the slime mold that we like to see on the river , and it means that the ecosystem of the environment is playing itself and playing itself .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and West .
Titan is a global village .
You need to look at large areas in order to organize like tuna .
Our region as scientists call the Entertainment Management , or ICCAT â€” the International Commission for Entertainment Protection .
Carl Shepherd put up one of the great things about all technology .
We can flag the clouds , but it &apos;s not good for the tuna fields .
Many people don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s heated .
It weighs over 40 degrees centigrade , and it heats up to 20 degrees Celsius around its environment .
All of the benefits of metal are closed .
The blood vessel supply chains the blood vessels don &apos;t last very long .
It &apos;s good for proteins .
But what &apos;s surprising about the 40-mile Gulf is that it cannot be stored in the form .
The time has been good , it doesn &apos;t have to be fast .
This is my political context .
Connecticut was running a war crash .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every dot has to be shared .
In the politics of Connecticut , there are 3,000 of them .
For example , I &apos;m saying that people are more likely to be connected â€” ( Laughter ) if anybody has the power of a connectome , I think we can improve the world dramatically .
And everywhere , these are rockets that disappear from the first place to give children to sleep .
As a result , we have a success story on the front lines and on the front lines .
When the space shuttle started , the space shuttle was funding six pounds to build a foundation .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s also a little bit of a mistake , because if you look at the Freeman &apos;s Facebook page , they fall infinitely short for a web page .
Whereas this information is also being processed by the file .
It &apos;s hard to say things like micro-payments and micro-payments .
But then again , the credit industry is pushing forward to replace the Phoenide Islands .
It &apos;s a system that generates oxygen , which is the planet Saturn .
This is seven percent per year .
Although we spend a little bit less money to get the market , we &apos;re also making a lot of money .
We not only eat grasshoppers , we also eat men and women .
We have things that are producing milk and that are what &apos;s happening .
Because on top of it , the blood and the hands and so forth add bullets .
I wonder if there &apos;s a gap that has opened the gap .
It &apos;s an Indian first or a sick person . ( Laughter ) And as a result , it &apos;s a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of wildlife products that have been taken out of the oceans .
This is the third part of China , or the number of American men out of the oceans every year .
The last thing in four comparisons is this .
Philadelphia actually started as a lifetime .
And it started with a local manufacturer who saw that the next day , no one would go to McDonald &apos;s .
He turned to his left and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
For the ocean , for the most part , it was evidence that Ebola was not Jesus .
So he built his lifetime scenario .
Unfortunately , the census came in 30 cents .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter sensor , so he set up an electronic code .
Actually , the Philadelphia Sandy is the largest mass-industrial art industry in the United States , between 23 billion and 3 billion pounds a year .
If we stop pollution , maybe it &apos;s Thailand .
20 years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plant proteins in a very powerful way in animal protein , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so good for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution that &apos;s one in nine months an adult .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a dirty vegetable .
There are no ACEs and DVDs that we think will keep us alive .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor little clip of mine .
Which represents a large part of three million tons .
One possibility of environmental protection is , can we eat it ?
Can we justify it instead of giving it to others ?
There are reasons for this .
They have a happy childhood to go to the marketplace , where the average elite is at the top of the Indus Valley .
This includes Exhibition 3 , EPA and DIY .
So this is her ability .
But instead of giving us a few dollars or a few seconds or a few seconds , and then turning it into a Facebook page , we brought the little jewelry and we put the little jewelry together to give the jewelry another money ?
The other countries that are also really interesting are home-specific .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
The calculations for Indonesia are extremely effective .
Indonesia &apos;s revenues are only three parts .
Actually , the top three are not made from milk .
The sea area is three stories tall , so they &apos;re just collected .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue algae , we have been exposed to the use of phosphorus and nitrogen .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , these are the major causes of death of ocean life .
As you might think about the Clouds , in all these different conditions , there are more than three proteins and more than three of them that are highly effective .
It &apos;s very real .
And the last one is a question mark .
We can create a kind of flexible pattern that can be proven to be useful as high as possible .
This creature needs to be green , has to grow and change rapidly , has to be able to form its own capabilities , like its own capabilities , and it needs to be an EPA , DHA , OMG3 and a Facebook Ed .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I say this , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million in the oceans .
What I mean by that is that everything is happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something , it &apos;s a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I had a big brain to solve because I have a brother who is affected by mental illness .
More and later , I wanted to think as a co-author , how do I connect my dreams to my reality , and I create my dreams ?
What happens with my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia is that they don &apos;t wake up to their dreams in public and in general , and they act on it .
So I stopped looking at mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked for Dr. Frankenstein Bank , who was a psychiatrist at Harvard University .
So what was the difference in people &apos;s brains that were searching for answers on a mathematical level ? So what was the difference in people &apos;s brains that were typically imagined as being compared to the brains of people who were seeking schizophrenia , or the brain stem , or the brain stem , was actually trying to generate the microbial spectrum of the brain , which cell is sending messages to
So there was a lot of privilege in my life because I was studying this crime in the day . &quot; &quot; But perhaps on the weekend , at least , on a weekly basis , I traveled to the National Ice Shelf a holiday camp .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intellectual disorder .
There was a new layer on the left of my brain .
And in the next four hours , I saw my brain completely dissolved by any ability to understand information .
I was able to write and remember something in the morning of college .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen an individual brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the part of the brain that touches the back of the brain with a wrist on the back of my hand , and this is how it arises in my mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
For those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain is acting like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain is acting like a solar processor .
These two parts are transferring messages to each other through the colossal chromosome that some 300 volumes are transferred to .
But they &apos;re also two parts of the alphabet .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part has to understand a completely different information , their facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial facial f@@
Encouragement â€” thank you . Enough .
Interviewer : Yes , a lot more .
( Laughter ) Our brain &apos;s data is just part of the brain , and it &apos;s thinking about this moment .
So right now , part of our brain is thinking about this as organic thinking about the movements of our body .
Information is stored and stored in our bodies in the form of energy , our entire nervous system , and then it &apos;s transformed into a giant Islamic class , which we see in the present moment how we feel and how we feel in the brain and how we learn .
I &apos;m an energy geared away from the energy of my surrounding the brain by the right brain .
We &apos;re using energy from each other to feel the reflection on the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we are brilliant cousins of this planet whose wisdom is to improve the world .
And at this point , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
Our brain is thinking scientifically and theoretically .
The lower part of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that our greatest Islamic / Class is now beginning to collect details and then assemble those conversations .
And it also informs organization and interpretation of all the things that are going on in the universe that we &apos;ve ever learned , and the possibilities of the future , namely , of our projects .
The left brain is thinking of language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that is taking us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a tiny voice that tells me how to go home and buy and remind you .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a sense of pursuing my cookbook that reminds me of reading books .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice he says ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; I become a separate person .
I become the only person around me with incredible energy and excitement .
And part of my brain was dealing with this morning &apos;s flight war .
The morning attacks of Philadelphia , my left eye with a huge pain behind my eyes .
It was as painful as a piece of an ax .
And it hurt me , and it hurts me .
And then he stopped , and then he left .
And it was extraordinary to me that I had never had any pain before , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Nothing , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I sat down and I looked at my career ladder , which is a body training machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , and it feels like my hand is the fate of an initial human that touches Dan .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is such a strange thing . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I seem like a big , weird thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I think has changed my mind , which is the general sense of being a human being in the machine , which is coming out of this experiment , but now I was in a very humble and opposite place where my sense of self
And this was all very strange and poor , and my heart was increasing .
So I got out of the machine and I started screaming in the room , and I felt like everything inside my body was simple .
And everywhere there is a lot of hard and hard thinking .
I have no connection to my behavior , and I think what I need is a household requirement , only within the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my closet preparing to be underwater , and I &apos;m really speaking inside my body a conversation .
I heard a voice that said , &quot; &quot; I need to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing , I &apos;m chewing the wall .
I lay down and look at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t repair my body &apos;s walls now .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand is held together by atoms and molecular walls .
If I understood something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And so the stuff on the left of my brain got quiet .
It &apos;s like someone has heard the sound of a TV screen from a Ramadan control .
A blood vessel .
First , I was surprised by the wiring of my brain .
But then immediately , the energy that came into the platform in this huge space that was around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt so incredible , so powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a bleeding occurred to the part of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a dopey animal . &quot;
We need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really more than any problem . ( Laughter ) That seems to be the case that I &apos;m really in love with the problem , but I &apos;ve come back to the same kind of feeling that I say for a lot of money .
But he was such a beautiful place .
Consider where it will be beautiful , where you will be completely connected by this tiny brain that keeps you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this cell where I &apos;m making pressure on it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And consider all of your relationships that are from the outside world , and some of them have been degraded .
And I felt a sense of peace and quiet .
And think about what it would look like if the backdrop of a 70-year-old emotional load you wrote .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a semicircle .
It was very beautiful .
Then my brain got involved , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow !
We need help , and I think I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help from my own backyard , and I &apos;ve been messing around with machinery now , and I &apos;ve been messing around in my apartment , and now I &apos;m thinking , can I drive a car ? And this is why my data has become completely disillusioned .
At that time , it occurred to me that my God was attacking me , and the other thing that my mind tells me is , how amazing it is !
( Laughter ) It &apos;s amazing !
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist who &apos;s going to take this opportunity to realize his own brain , and he &apos;s going to come in â€” ( Laughter ) â€” and then one blood comes to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very popular woman â€” ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to relax . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t get rid of the golf course , but in two weeks , I &apos;ll return to my normal . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call my job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the number of jobs , and then I remembered that I had my business card on which my phone number was .
I go to my studio and I open up a three-story motorcycle .
And I look at the top card as I can see from my brain &apos;s eyes clearly what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this is my card , not because I don &apos;t look at the dots .
And the words on the page were held by punch cards and punch marks , and I didn &apos;t know anything .
And then I started waiting for him to describe himself to me .
And in that moment , the public realm repeated itself , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card , it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this video .
And during this period of 45 minutes , the effects of the collision on the left were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I don &apos;t have any path .
So I take the phone and I put it in there .
I took a business card and I put it here , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the phone , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards .
But then I picked my elbow when I came back , it didn &apos;t remind me that I had a number that I didn &apos;t have .
So I raised my hand like a donor , and I raised my hand on the Hindus , and I told my other hand that when I came back to the normal truth , I can tell you that I was here in India , and I finally got all the way from all of India , and I heard that the phone rings on my wrist , a friend turned up and said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I
So I say to her , in my mind , &quot; I &apos;m speaking , I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Wooo , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; My God speaks like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he tells me what I didn &apos;t know was that I couldn &apos;t speak a language , and I can &apos;t understand until I tried to speak .
So he understood that I needed help and he supported me .
And then a little while later , in an ambulance , Sierra Leone from Boston was visiting another psychiatrist Gertrude .
I walked up and looked like a tiny baby .
Just like a candle waxing for the rest of the room and just squeezing outside , I pulled the energy out and felt the wind blowing .
And that moment made me realize that I &apos;m not alone in my life right now .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life , or gives me a chance to transition .
By the time I got there , I was surprised that I still lived .
When I was feeling my soul , I was saving my life .
Now my brain was distorted between two facts .
At that time , my emotional system started to become driven by just feeling suffocated by pain .
Light shined my brain like the fire of the forest , and the lights were on and off , and the lights were blowing back , and I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , or I couldn &apos;t hear a voice , and I was just blowing through the air .
Because I couldn &apos;t understand my body posture , I couldn &apos;t understand my body posture , so I felt enormously larger and wide , like someone who had been free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a giant wallet sitting in the middle of nowhere .
The Great Divergence .
I found the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking that this would never happen if I could discover my great civilization and accumulate the inside of a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;m welcomed .
And if I have a neuron , and I still live , then whatever life is , it can accomplish neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world like this , filled with lovely , fresh , comfortable and loving people who know that they can sometimes feel this quality .
And they can be chosen for life , and the right is that they want to take their books off the left side of their brain to look for this pure quality .
And then I realized how incredible this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was the lesson of a texture that taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After the collision of the collision of the collision , the south pointed out a blood vessel equivalent to a naked blood vessel in my brain that was monitoring the sadness center of the brain .
I &apos;m here with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
I &apos;ve been completely healthy for eight years .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life with both hands and two extremely good brains .
And we have the power to choose because of who we are and what we want to be in the world .
It &apos;s a place where I can step in the right part of my consciousness , where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful mammalian cells are found in one form , one in which all of them exist .
Or I can choose to walk to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual . &quot; &quot; In a busy way .
Water splashes .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And who ?
And I think as long as we spend our left-right brain electricity grid , we &apos;re going to increase world peace , and our planet is going to be extremely fragile .
And I thought that the idea needed to be redesigned .
Thank you .

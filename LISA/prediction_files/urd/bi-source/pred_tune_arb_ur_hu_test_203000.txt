Good morning .
Are you people staying ?
They brought my name to Twitter , but I want to ask you , did anyone here write their name on Twitter in Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , just before teenage years , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends and I was waiting for food .
So I asked myself , did you have a drink in Arabic ?
He looked at me strangely , thinks he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sirens ? ( In English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Sirens ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re saying ? &quot; &quot; I did . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call him &quot; &quot; Minie , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minie . &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem . &quot; &quot; He said .
She was speaking to me with three people , as she said to me , &quot; If she was the only girl in the world , I would not see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; Money &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy placed a girl on two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can he speak that way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got frustrated with that .
Sure enough .
What is it that I find worthy of speaking in my country ?
Where is that possible ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am like many people , who have reached a stage in their lives where , incidentally , they leave everything they have in their past , just to say , they &apos;re loved and loved .
Should I drive all my culture , all my ideas , all my intellect and spirit ?
We may have the most important battle savings in children &apos;s stories .
Do they want to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What makes sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that choice as much as I did for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or research , or language that we use in neuroscience , the language that we use in workplace , the language that we observe when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use when we use wireless data .
If we do that , they will cover us .
So where can I exploit it ? We can all ask these questions .
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we should think about .
It &apos;s Arabic .
Research says that in order to acquire skills in other languages , you need to translate that into your mother tongue .
In other languages , the mother language is the primary language for creativity .
How ?
The Greban cell , when he first started writing , used Arabic .
All of their imaginations , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in the car where he grew up , felt a particular joy , a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their text in English , you feel so happy , you feel the same sense .
Now you can imagine that this is also in English , this little boy sitting in a basement in the front of a building .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill a language .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging economies are emerging .
Crime , France , Egypt and China are all in power .
That &apos;s why they legislate in order to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in reserves , they spend a lot of money on the expansion of Wisconsin .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this growing mindset is not even reaching us , and we want to get to the developed world .
They were countries like us in an era , but they decided to try to make progress , study , and move to countries , such as teachers , meetings , and so on , they would take their language as they were leaving the schools , as Hurricane did .
They kept him close .
Because if you &apos;re a product or a product or a product and it &apos;s not written on a train , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be joined in these unprecedented markets , like we are most of the time .
So to create new innovations and innovations , they needed to maintain their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Cyrus , altruism , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just for conversation ; words are just for us .
Language is a symbol of the particular stages in our lives , and the words that are separated from our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , altruism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a special circuit in your brain . There are special feelings for a particular day in a particular history .
Language is not a word or two or three .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our minds ?
How are you going to understand it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , then I better leave and I don &apos;t waste time talking .
It &apos;s that these affections remind us of a particular thing .
I have a French speaker friend who &apos;s a French speaker .
At one point he was asking the right question .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but one time , I tried to put his wife in and translate it one night , what does &quot; &quot; immigration . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Across the village , she called her &quot; &quot; immigration , &quot; &quot; and then several nights , she tried to think .
And he wondered , how can one be so clear ?
Does she want to make herself ?
&apos;Bury me . &apos; ( English ) ( Together : This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his wife , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; his thoughts are different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me , and one night , I tried to translate to him , to feel what I felt when I heard February . &quot; &quot; Bert woman tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve raised my hand and you &apos;ve taken it for granted . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Because you are me , I have left your hand and I have left you behind .
He translates it . He shows me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to confirm the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a way of thinking about the society , and we started the Library of Arabic language .
While many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whether it &apos;s cold , keep it quiet . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The key to the conservation of Arabic has heard a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because , like , we don &apos;t understand it .
And if anyone says to me , I am terrified of Arabic .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be told in the way that our dreams , our dreams , and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the way we feel and the way we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you from the east , but you &apos;re responding to the West . &quot; &quot; He said the right thing .
It &apos;s very easy , but it &apos;s good and it &apos;s effective .
After that , we started another key with the landscape of the letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside , a context in which the letters are in the back of a blue and blue trip , with the translation , &quot; Language killing . &quot;
Why ? Really , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really should not kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to find a existence for ourselves .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great opportunity to create novelty and religion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
Cal is photographed by boys and girls .
We are very coal .
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve described the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to make as much admittedness as two , but I &apos;m going to give you a word that &apos;s good and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be in the yellow corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not funny . We shouldn &apos;t be saving ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to allow anyone to grow up , or that we &apos;re going to have to decide that language is above us , putting pressure on us , or putting pressure on our patients and thinking on us .
Our idea has to be creative .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or we can &apos;t redefine the rocket or anything , we can still be creative .
At that time , each of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or make a short film .
Once upon a time , we can scale globally .
He can repeat the first line of Arabic .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we need to know that , and we need to be told that there is a solution , we need to be part of that solution .
Ultimately , what can you do today ?
Who here is Twitter ?
For religion , I reject you , even though my time is gone , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But data is not Arabic with the Latin script .
( Applause ) This is it . It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a mathematical language .
Getting back and forth is not easy .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We are here to enjoy the need for language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
For the first time , a child knows his father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , yes . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve gone from my daughter &apos;s light to the market , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of copyright . ( Applause )
I &apos;m telling you Latin English that it &apos;s going to lead us to a tragic reminder that our situation is not a secret , that it &apos;s from the negative circumstances that make people so proud of me , until you see my generation as a banker , when we see a great deal of inequality , it doesn &apos;t lead to our generation as much as it is to express our generation as we know it
( Applause )
My favorite pie is a penny .
In college , I had my primary thesis as a vegetable , which meant I was writing lots of documents .
Now a normal person when they write something , the way they do it is that they do something .
You know , you know â€” ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do your job at a very low rate , but in the first week , you &apos;re going to do a lot of work , and after a lot of work , everything &apos;s done , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I also want to do it that way .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is all going to be ready , but actually the text function will start , and then I &apos;ll do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with all the text messages .
And then we came up with a new paper , a paper which you did for a year .
And I knew that my common denominator was not an insult .
It was a huge job .
I set up a plan , and I decided to do something like this .
This year , something like this will happen .
I &apos;m going to start out small , middle months , and I &apos;m going to increase the speed of work , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it even more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
Come and get home , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then they would also be ugly , and I hadn &apos;t written anything , and we were kind of ugly .
And two months went by one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then one day he would go and spend three days in the David Line , and he didn &apos;t even write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 houses , and I put 90 pages , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads , two roads ,
I thought , now it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; All right . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Well , from now on , that &apos;s great . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe . ( Laughter )
He was very generous . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited for that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the list .
My dream is always to give people ugly gifts , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the human brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis was that simple people &apos;s brains make differences between six people .
To find out that I made a leaf blood vessel where I could study two brains like this , the right brain and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look at it carefully and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not that great , but consider one .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
There are tens of thousands of decisions in both brains , but there &apos;s pleasure in the human brain .
Now what does that mean for a star ?
I mean , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; Good time to work &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; A well-meaning philanthropy is going to make a decision to make a difference , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he &apos;s running the show , and he says , &quot; &quot; Look at the page of the Chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Nanny Cohn and Tim Harden , because I know it &apos;s just happened .
( Laughter ) So â€” ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;re going to zoom in and see , in 10 minutes , something new happened ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , which will start with a conversation about the race of TED in Copenhagen , and much later , it will be finished to see the Internet for Mother Baby mothers .
( Laughter ) And all of these things will take a little bit of time , so we won &apos;t have time to do something today .
What &apos;s compassion going to be like . ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this is not the kind of pleasure you want to say .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t seem like a future without any idea of just two things : ease and enjoy .
In the animal kingdom , it &apos;s all good .
If you do and you spend your entire life going forward and forever , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Good to eat , good to think , and increase generation , in rural areas , maybe that &apos;s what happens .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , it &apos;s not that far off .
We are an advanced religion , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain that decides , a smart person , that we can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are far from giving .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is to protect what makes us happy .
Sometimes it seems just as good to do what is easily and exhilarating as eating , sleeping or experiencing moments of opportunity .
There &apos;s an incident .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult , for a big purpose .
And this is the key barrier .
And for strangers , this contradiction always leads to an end , which spends more time in a small space , a simple and mysterious path that has been out of the circle .
I call it a marketplace .
( Laughter ) Dark is the place where the Serious people are well-known .
There &apos;s an authority at the time when obligation should not be driven .
In the dark fields that you see , it &apos;s not really the fun , because it &apos;s not the right , it &apos;s the worst , it &apos;s the fear , it &apos;s the feeling of anxiety , it &apos;s all the properties that are in the good system .
The question is , in this way , when the inner city heats up , how does the evil man intervene in the blind , which is a place of less happy but important ?
It turns out that the Sistine people too are protected , which is kept security all the time in their harsh moments â€” somebody said home .
( Laughter ) Now , this is the home that I &apos;m most excited about , but when David Lane gets near , it gets really awful , or it &apos;s when people are at risk of embarrassment , of employment or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that the core is just that .
Now I &apos;ve had this connection in my life , because six months ago , people at TED connected me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I &apos;ve been there .
I had my dream at TED last year .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of my jungle and synagogue , there was something else going on in the brain that made decisions from the mind .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Did you understand anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going on in the future ?
We need to start now . He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the map of India at less than 2,000 feet , let &apos;s just put a sleeping room when we don &apos;t see India , and look at India , and look at India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , another month , and the TED people decided to name the critic .
I downloaded the websites and I had a picture of myself holding onto it .
And guess who ?
( Laughter ) The house was controlled , and within a few seconds the system was revealed to be on fire . ( Laughter )
And remember , he &apos;s frightened of the house â€” he &apos;s cool and he &apos;s down on the tree .
And finally , and finally , a decisive decision maker made headlines and I could start talking .
Now , the household that tells you the disagreement between every category and every category , someone like me would give you two weeks , and the disagreement between the beginning of the asylum , and then incredibly successful task gives you an incredible amount of insight to go to sleep every night and write a sentence .
And the total of three clear-cuts is now called the Serious people &apos;s system .
That &apos;s very good , not for batteries .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the implications of it .
In fact , I &apos;ve received thousands of emails from around the world and from people who have different kinds of emotions .
They included the kidney , the bankers , the engineers , the penetrators and the CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost one thing was telling and saying , &quot; I &apos;m in the face of this mystery . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and missions from email .
There was a myth in the script of these people that wrote how much Solly wrote about his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what &apos;s next ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
Well , it turns out that on the left are two equals .
The examples I gave you today , which were all about subjects , were all David Len .
And when David is online , recently , his effects are crucial because he reaches home .
But Switzerland is a different kind of thing , and it &apos;s not a data link .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like an arts or a commercial â€” like some arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start acting as a machine to accelerate , to operate .
In addition to doing so , there are many other things that David Lawn doesn &apos;t have , like being with his family , exercising , thinking about his health , thinking about his relationships , telling them the relationship with whom he doesn &apos;t have access to .
Now if the only way that Solar &apos;s job is to go home and work is , it &apos;s difficult , because all these data lines that are created in the context of the home that is being lost .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest impact is that you can &apos;t drive them , they &apos;re always with his dad .
And it &apos;s a kind of profound metaphor that tends to be much less glamorous and much less glamorous than just the metaphor , a kind of profound metaphor .
You &apos;re good at reasoning and good news .
And that could be the case for the long term and for the long term .
So I thought it was because of their email , and they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban Machine system found them , sometimes in their lives .
The trouble is not that they cannot ask their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and one thing came out â€” I think there &apos;s no sixth people .
I think all of you are sisters .
It may not be that complicated . Some of us , ( Applause ) And maybe some of the data from the press is good for links , but remember the scenes from the presence of David Lane .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Every single market means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when something of them is being applied .
I think we all need to take charge of this calendar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in jobs , because in every single life , no one is getting sick .
We need to be careful .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have that home , maybe we should start right now .
Maybe not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One hundred days of U.S. and Afghanistan , an access to the U.S. and Afghanistan was leaving over from one area of Afghanistan to one area of Afghanistan , so that an office of the Afghan government could help provide a fund to protect an office in Afghanistan to help provide a fund to help protect the Afghan security operation so that an organization could help provide a fund to protect the Afghan security operation from
He came in at the end of an invasion , and he was hanging around with three things , and with a lot of things , he watched Captain Switzerland as a child , and you watched Captain Switzerland as a child rescuing the victims and taking away the dead .
One of the people who knew her children , one of the guards and one of the Spanish doctors , was moving towards a helicopter , and one of the other Spanish doctors was moving toward one helicopter .
It showed that the Copenhagen , the Spartans , and the Spartans , are dealing with this greenhouse gases .
They put it in the Halloween cockpit , and then you can see that the Copenhagen is sitting there and staring at it before it hits other people to save .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are extremely depressing emotions when you want to do something like this .
Here &apos;s a lovely one , and I knew why I was doing it with people who didn &apos;t .
You know , at the bottom of the fashion , people who are yearning to be self-persuading so that others can benefit .
In business , we hire people who are willing to vote for others in order to benefit us .
We have online numbers .
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they go to the forest .
These are the best people achieving this vision of services , and these better people achieve this vision of services .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is an environment , and if you &apos;re in a dense environment , each of us has the potential to work together , so each of us has the potential to work together and enhance the ability to do that in others .
I have the greatest privilege of getting some of these people together yesterday and saying , &quot; &quot; Why can you do this ?
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; Because they do it for me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The hard thing about believing trust and cooperation is that these feelings are not obstacles .
That &apos;s not possible for you to &quot; &quot; check me out , &quot; &quot; and you do .
It can &apos;t be that I give two people the chance to collaborate , and they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does it come from ?
If you go 50,000 years before the present , what we see is the beginning of the future Homo sapiens , that the world is full of dangers , all of these branches are very focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal .
Wanting is a lack of resources , a long-term satellite , but it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan .
And so we were ready for social animals , where we &apos;re all together and doing what I call a charity , like in a neighborhood where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt secure in ourselves , it was a natural responsibility .
It has a continuous payload .
That means I can sleep at night and I can scroll around and see some of the risks in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t marry you , it means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for survival .
The modern day is exactly the same .
These worlds are faced with risks that are trying to make our lives difficult or attempt to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our success .
This can be a society that can scale beyond truth in the stock market .
It can be a new technology that will take your commercial bread away overnight , and it can be a new technology that will take your commercial bread away at night .
Or it can be your opposite , which sometimes tries to run you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s going to steal your rise , and your businesses are trying to get you out of business , it &apos;s going to steal your rise , and your businesses are trying to get you out of business .
We have no authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the technical jobs are , because that &apos;s the truth that &apos;s going in the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect and protect the lives of the people in his organization that are protecting the people in his organization and the lives of the people in his organization , and that is to assess their own personal and good-looking results so that people can experience their own epiphany and their own good outcomes so that people can feel safe and feel their own personal relationships , then things can be found .
I was on a journey , and I noticed one fact that when a passenger tried to get in front of me before he found it , and I saw the staff on the door that he would come in like he passed the law as I was .
The first time I tried to read it , it was the first time I tried to read it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are we doing the brakes like these ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit with us as human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
It &apos;s not because we like to travel to the West Bank , it &apos;s not because they keep improving the LGBT people .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t pay for their own leaders .
You see , if conditions are preserved , we spend our time and our strength keeping each other safe , we spend our time and our strength keeping each other safe , and therefore less organization .
What a great leader can give you the closest example of being a parent is what a good leader can give you as a closest example of being a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what would you like ? What is it made of ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the certificate , when it is necessary , we want to give our children the opportunity , the education , the order , the record , when it is necessary , to make them grow and to do more of what we can do for ourselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Well , that &apos;s exactly what leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , policy and record , and when they want to give their people the opportunities , education , policy and record , and when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to create self-confidence , the time and failure so that they can achieve the greater prosperity that we &apos;ve ever had , so that they can achieve greater advances than what we &apos;ve ever imagin@@
Charlie Kamen , who &apos;s the CEO of a technology company called Next Jump in New York City , is the CEO of a technology company called Next Jump , and they say , if you have a hard time in your family , will you ever save your own child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has a practical lack of forensic practice ; Charley has a practical lack of forensiveness .
If you &apos;re a Next Jump employee , you don &apos;t get a job based on effective problems .
But if you &apos;ve got a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , just like we &apos;re going to do for a kid who comes home from school and checks .
It &apos;s very different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are CEOs , and the reason so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are CEOs , and the reason so many people are so frustrated and angry , some bankers are CEOs who are unequally frustrated and unequivocally brave .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have found the basic principles of competence .
They have broken a society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their well-being to their kids , and we know that they &apos;ve given their well-being to their kids , but they &apos;ve also told them that they &apos;ve convinced their well-being to their people , rather than that they &apos;ve convinced their well-being to save their lives .
That &apos;s what predicts us , not data .
Does anyone assume that Gando has invested 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problems ? Absolutely not . Not at all .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
Good leaders will never sacrifice people to save data .
They &apos;re going to give people the skin data to save , but they &apos;re going to give people skin data to save .
Baby chips in the Madison Media Lab , they run a mining company in Baby Chapminder , and they run a mining company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 , and they showed up 30 percent of their traffic jam overnight .
Now in a large mining company , this is a huge problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their own furniture more .
They needed 10 million dollars of children , so many of the companies that are now involved and do the right thing .
And Bob responded .
You &apos;ll notice that the Baby Boomers don &apos;t believe .
It &apos;s also believing in the gender of the Buddha , and it &apos;s harder to reduce the symptoms , and it &apos;s harder to reduce the symptoms .
And then they built a dedicated plan .
That every employee , from the Critic to the CEO , had to put everyone in the small four-week vacation .
They could never do it when they wanted it and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But as Bob declared his program , he kept it very important .
He said that it was better for all of us to take small doses of disgust , rather than to take a few of us seriously and turn it upside down .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and the most important thing is , as you might expect , when people feel secure from an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody expected , people started businesses from each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful people .
So something like five centuries ago allowed anybody to pay for three hours .
Gravity is an extreme , not a contradiction .
I know many people who benefit from the most successful organizations , I know many people who benefit from the most successful organizations that are not a leader at all .
They &apos;re supposed to be attacks , and we do what they say , because they get stuck on us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know many people who are in the upper right-hand corner of organizations who don &apos;t have any authority and are a real leader , and that &apos;s because they have the authority to look at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they have the authority to look at the person on the right , and they have the authority to look at the person on the right .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the technologies that were out there in the kitchen , and as the technique of the technicians is , you eat in the honey and you preach to your people and when you eat , you save nothing for it .
And when he came back into the field , he gave him some meals from his restaurant so he could eat because that &apos;s what he did .
We tell them that they start .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re responsible for someone else &apos;s first danger , and we call them leaders because they &apos;re responsible for somebody else &apos;s first danger .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that they can protect them , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that people can protect them and make them better , and when we do that , natural responsibility is that our people want to protect us .
They &apos;re going to give us our blood and our lungs and we &apos;re going to let them see that their dream becomes real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
Why can you bring your blood and your lungs and your lungs to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say , &quot; &quot; Because they do that for us . &quot; &quot; And is that not the organization that we all like to do ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re all going to like to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the story of a little girl named Mimpopo , who was also known as Limpopo and Mpumalanga .
Where the water supply and the water supply is very unfair as a condition , and it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions at the age of 17 , I was quietly in the dead zone with friends .
The sun in the winter is very hot .
And as I was peering through the door , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why can &apos;t you create something that just squeaks on your skin and doesn &apos;t you have to cut ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I found some surprising statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred of them are in small Africans , and there &apos;s nothing in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is one of the most dangerous drugs known as trachoma .
A reflection given to the naked eye is due to the loss of the eye by one of the most extensive injections of the trachoma that you can be injected continuously .
This disease kills eight million people every year , and the most important thing is to get rid of your trachoma , you just need to get rid of it : no kidney , no gas , no engineering .
After looking at the data from Afghanistan , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not only doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less than that , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then Miguel was one of his top 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I went to Google and published a paper
And I looked at this as a personal problem .
So Mahammad said it was right , our formula was ready .
Now we need to be able to make that happen .
Four years later , with the mobile phone in 40 pages full of businesses on my phone , after writing my patent , I &apos;m the smallest patent holder in the country and â€” ( &quot; &quot; now and no more ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first mysterious alternative .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need the digestion .
( Laughter ) So after trying to impact it in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Machine University entered some new people , further functions , and now we have fully an effective radio that is ready for the market , but now it &apos;s available in the marketplace .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at large .
He purchases just under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cake . He purchases a cheese sandwich because it makes it more interesting .
So we put DryBath in these creative blocks .
You put it between your head and the outside .
And the best thing is , a simple replacement of a mystery is only in five orders .
After the invention of this model , we learned a lot more about manufacturing .
We even want DryBath the expectant offspring ( Laughter ) at least once in a week .
Anyway , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever they leave , and we could save two houses for children , which is two houses , more than two houses for school , more than two houses for children .
After seeing the global impact , we &apos;ve taken away the key values , the cleanliness and the solidarity .
DryBath is a poor man &apos;s service and a protector of a poor man &apos;s life .
We &apos;re actually entering this project in process , and we &apos;re actually entering this era of commercializing a multinational branding that can be sold into the retail market , and one question that I &apos;m going to ask you today is , for Limpopo , launching the Limpopo , for a week , with 50 ranks of Aaron to come up with a way that doesn &apos;t have to ruin the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done anything yet , I haven &apos;t done anything yet .
And the other important thing is that I learned a lot about this recent work , which was that last year Google challenged me as the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I &apos;m now the world &apos;s greatest student science entrepreneur , the first African to have access to this accumulation , and one thing that amazes me is why all of these students did not want to bribe . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m glad to share with you some of these results today , and I wonder what the real reasons for the success of organizations are for , which are , in fact , the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find the human potential that was once impossible .
You will see them as possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is it that most of them don &apos;t work ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know that eventually things are the most important for success .
I wanted to find a lot of organizations about this , and I wanted to fill in many of my professional ideas and misconceptions that came from some of the other organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was a 12-year-old founder of a variety of different businesses that were coming from New Jersey High School to kindergarten while I was building solar power tools , and then I was in college when I was making radio .
I graduated from high school , I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , at the beginning of the Library of India , in the last 20 years , we have made hundreds of companies that are very successful , and very big progress .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I &apos;ve tried to be the biggest success or failure of organizations on these factors .
So I looked at these five .
First , I think .
I think everything is fine .
So I wrote a company called &quot; &quot; The Origin of Species , &quot; &quot; which is the old moment that you feel about any idea .
With grief , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to control , the ability to control , is even more essential .
I never thought it would be appropriate to speak at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s got a plan , until one &apos;s got a plan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team in transformation is important for the ability to train mothers .
Car is an eternal reality .
So I thought maybe the most important thing was the team .
So I started looking at the market model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about income ?
With him , it seemed to me that what is the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes institutions make a huge investment .
Is that the most important thing ?
After that , of course â€” is it the right time ?
Was that a short thought , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s short , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or is it too late , and is it before I get so anxious ?
So I &apos;ve gained a lot of respect in many organizations .
And the idea was to reach out to 100 companies in Libya , and 100 of them outside to try to find a scientific result .
So first of all , these new lead companies , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoGoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” these are all dollars of success .
And on the lower level , five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peopleline , we were very hopeful , but it didn &apos;t work .
And then I tried to cultivate all these characters , as I think these companies had promoted .
Then from the outsiders of the ideological literature , I looked at weird advances , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and LinkedIn .
Here &apos;s some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
They had excellent investment in small companies , and sometimes they had a market model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the greatest impact of all these companies had on success and failure , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was choosing time .
Twenty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
It &apos;s on the other side of the team and the team , and then , I think , being different , remembering different , that &apos;s actually number three .
But it &apos;s not really obvious , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was surprised that I didn &apos;t think it was the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the commercial model and the investment in my mind .
I think the commercial model is still very small , because you can do it without a commercial model , and then when customer production increases , including that .
And investment , if initially it &apos;s small , but now it &apos;s increasing , so especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples of all of these Nutmeg algorithms .
They take a big success on Airbnb , as you all know .
It &apos;s very famous for how many venture capitalists in this company looked at it because people thought , &quot; Who is it going to be that some of our houses are going to put on a ticket ? &quot;
Of course , that was the wrong thing .
One of the reasons why gross has succeeded is because of the best market model , the idea , and the market perspective , it &apos;s the right time .
This company came in front of the financial challenges when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people to reject protests in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came forward , the best company , the best market model , and also the best farmer .
However , time was absolutely right to make the drivers they needed .
Dreaders also had aspirations for additional income ; that was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch , come when people needed a toilet .
Goto.com , which we announced at TED in 1998 , was a time when businesses wanted more discrimination .
We thought it was great , but in fact , the right time was probably more .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it â€” with a lot of collaborators and a wonderful marketing examination , to work with the great Halloward artists .
In May 1999 to 2000 , the Broad Internet was very , very small .
The online video was really hard to see , you didn &apos;t need to know what to do in your broadcaster , and it ended up being completed in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of code , and Broadband in America , more than 50 percent of it , YouTube got the best time .
I think it &apos;s the best way to measure time .
The truth is , when YouTube started , there was no commercial model .
They weren &apos;t even sure it would work .
But he was choosing extremely well .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
I think it &apos;s very important .
But maybe timing is really important .
And the best way to repair time is to see if they &apos;re really car-ready for your wedding .
And certainly the uncertainty is , the outcome is not from the outcome , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but over time you have to work with a lot of uncertainty .
Like initial organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully , some of them will be helpful to increase your success , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 a.m. on May 2016 we saw the greatest data in history &#93; &#91; Five successes have pointed out poor and powerful people &#93; &#91; Excellent money is leaked in non-governmental societies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We have pointed to the Gulf Walters Report to Exhibit . &#93; This week , the revolution of storytellers from Gaya Million ac@@
Fifty years ago , those papers were published to participate in small shell companies .
We have the inner stories of cars , banks and schools that are coming in with forms like Mozambique Financial , and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , we should have a terrible company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually look at email , you can look at text messages , you can look at how they work , how they work .
Its implications are starting to emerge .
The prime minister of the U.S.
We also have this news that the slime mold companies are wearing cotton fields from Alaska .
Two billion dollars &apos; worth of stolen from Russia down to the original desk from his childhood friend , a famous server .
And many brave people will be infected , and whatever story they have , will be at home .
Now , this looks like a magical movie or a John Geiger character .
What should we do about it ?
But the truth is that givers and powerful people are living in their own pockets , and as much as they don &apos;t need to be taxed , what that means is that academic performance , such as adults , has less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
My organization for Galapagos Vision is amazing .
Global media and political leaders are talking about how people in clothing companies have their influences â€” what we &apos;re talking about with our opinions .
I think it &apos;s a cool , sexy world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to think that these weapons companies are doing things .
I think it &apos;s like the Red Brigades .
You can run a company inside of a company , a company inside a company , and it &apos;s almost impossible to figure out who is behind this thing .
For law enforcement agencies , tactics , journalists , schools , it &apos;s hard to understand what &apos;s happening .
I think it &apos;s also interesting in the United States that we haven &apos;t talked about .
Maybe it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t have to be in this Scandal .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in the United States that don &apos;t invest in corporations .
That &apos;s why the U.S. Constitution operates as a way of shell companies , some of the American cities in Mozambique .
I think if we &apos;re reading the Kamen Air Force , or the Wall Street or the Wall Street or the New Zealand , it &apos;s the kind of thing that the U.S. communicates .
Instead , many American leaders don &apos;t have to give that information , but they need less information to give them to the company than they need to get to the library .
In American schools , this kind of information is given to students .
Ninety-nine units of capital are saved by easy .
This kind of thing is affecting all of us .
Now in the Gulf Ventures , we wanted to see how this problem came about .
How does it actually work ?
So what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve transferred a grant to run 13 intelligence companies in Manhattan .
Our heritage as an African minister wanted to transfer the village across America to a home , a ship and a neighborhood .
The heart valve was that all of the villages gave us predictions of how the village could move .
These were all primary meetings , and no one would ever make our own money , and we didn &apos;t give anybody any money , but it was a disaster for the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not treated as individual transactions .
It &apos;s not about private equity , which has talked about controversy and controversy .
It &apos;s not just about a census scientist reported in Singapore .
It &apos;s about the way the system works , which is keeping track of fire , weight , and inefficiency .
And for that to happen , we &apos;re going to change the game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be difficult to generate in this kind of way .
It can be intuitive , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , so rich and powerful people will always be .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the last few years , we &apos;ve been taking a step towards transparency where the power of the company is .
This issue was launched on a political agenda , but the British Prime Minister David Committee declared 8 seconds in the Gulf of South Land in 2013 .
And since then , Europe has been forming a major global record , whether or not there are companies in Europe that are actually owning or controlling .
The evidence is that the E.U. is behind it .
There &apos;s a disconnect between the mapping of a mixed legal system and the center and the network , which we didn &apos;t want to be as advanced as we were , so we were five .
They want to see inventions , large-scale companies , used across the world and in the United States .
It &apos;s a moment of change in the Gulf of Tunisia .
We need to reach out to the people who know what they know behind barbed wires .
Now , please raise your voice , that &apos;s not good for picking this kind of flexibility . We do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and they need to address the legislative change in access to information .
We can bring together this flexibility to close the gap between creation and classrooms .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Like , the inventor of you , in the last few years , has had so much sensation available that the rest of the world &apos;s media is larger .
Can it be true ?
Julian Singer : Yes , can it be true ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a problem â€” what isn &apos;t it ? â€” that the media of the world is showing such a bad performance that a small group of employees are able to capture the kind of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does it happen ?
How do people make dictionaries ?
And how do you keep them engaged ?
Julian Singer : So here we are â€” I can tell you â€” using public services in the right way , and we have a lot of ways to get the information to us .
That &apos;s why we use a lot of cool containers to move material around the Internet from one place to another , to draw signals from legal perspectives like Sweden and Bill .
We get information from data , from ordinary data , from Ram Smith or whatever , organizing it like regular news organizations , funnels â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about massive information for citizens and then protecting yourself against the illegal law and political beliefs .
CA : So you &apos;ve got to try to make sure that documents are real , but you don &apos;t really know what the scale is .
Julian Singer : That &apos;s right , that &apos;s where we &apos;re always going , and if we &apos;re going to get to the point where we &apos;re going to get to the point where we &apos;re going to get the information out of the skin .
( Clapping ) God made it .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : So I think it &apos;s kind of cool and you &apos;re asking what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
For example , real .
This is something you thought about a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Juliano Sang : So this is a cholera report .
This was an infamous report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , there was the government of Daniel Arpha , 18 years ago .
She was a nurse in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of Cuba â€” despite the authoritarian regimes that were trying to get the power of China â€” they bought 20 million pounds of reputation for this report and one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to protect its political well-being , which was the best man â€” still the smartest person in Kenya .
This is June for the Kenyan press .
That &apos;s why it was launched in 2007 , and we were able to successfully achieve the election before December 2008 .
When we did that report , three days after the new president decided to volunteer , Kabul decided to volunteer for this person who was terrible , Daniel Arp , so this report was handed over and over in the corner of the capital city .
CA : And â€” I mean , just to make a long story short , it &apos;s â€” it &apos;s been launched in Kenya , not by military dictatorship , but by ordinary means , and by the way , it &apos;s changed the result of your choice .
Julian Singer : Yes . This is the fastest growing season of Gaddafin and then all of the rest of Kenya in the Newspaper of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , after a few months , convinced the Prime Minister of Kenya that they could talk about it .
And this truck landed on the TV for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the volume , depending on an online sex report , and it changed the result of that .
CA : Wow , so your secret mindset has changed the world ?
Juliet Singer : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we go . We &apos;re going to show you a little video of a tiny amount of data .
This video is so luxurious . But here &apos;s a little clip .
This is â€” I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart failure .
RD : It &apos;s smart , when you first put two of them together .
I realized , oh , they have four things .
The road is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is leaving .
When they &apos;re on your show , tell me . Gold .
They &apos;re all dollars .
Hold on ! Glass !
( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running . Galen is running . ( Mechanical noises ) Galen is running .
Hello . Blue Master 2 : two , three .
Now we should , time is up .
Okay , now we &apos;ve got eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two old Dragon Caffer , and we &apos;re still looking at Gulf .
Roger . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what about society . What was it ?
God makes you smaller , smaller . Good . Yeah , I grabbed them .
CA : So what happened ?
Julian Singer : The people who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
So we ended up having two people involved in this research .
It was the first in three dimensions that happened in that reality .
CA : So there were 11 people in this attack , two employees in general ?
Juliet Singer : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two small children were injured .
In total , from 18 to 26 people have died .
Chris Anderson : And after his execution , he had a great time .
What was the fundamental cause of the regret , you think ?
Julian Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as being incredibly unequal .
On the one hand , some aspirin are going to go , and then a kilometer away , the aspirin begins to scratch 30 meters of helium caffeine for every person â€” very much â€” and gives birth to children .
They also had two journalists who weren &apos;t wealthy because they were journalists .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining was arrested , and he said that he had acknowledged that he had shown this video to you , besides 280,000 and stupidly American documents .
Does that really happen ?
Juliet Singer : So what we did was to accept the documents .
It got a request just five days ago , which is to get 150,000 documents and make 50 .
But we &apos;ve done it now in the beginning of the year by Rhinola and an American safety house , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of accessories for the U.S. safety house ...
Juliano Sang : We &apos;re going to do what we &apos;re going to do . ( CA : Y &apos;all going to do ? ) Juliet Singer : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Juliano Sung : Because things like this show that , in fact , what the real world is , for example , the Arab states , in these states , are going to be more violent in human rights .
If you look at close profiles of this kind of material .
CA : Talk about that .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right to create hidden information ?
Julian Singer : So the question is , how important information in the world is , what information can &apos;t be .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that organizations spend money on , and it &apos;s a good indication that when they should have access to information , they have the hope to do something better , because the organizations know it better , and they know the stories , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there any risks to this as individually or as collectively as societies , where innovation is unexpected ?
Julie Singer : We didn &apos;t do the same thing with the records .
I mean , our big battle is practical .
With information , we &apos;re able to gather information in a very specific way that is unique â€” information that &apos;s available to someone .
But there are also some mysteries â€” like your doctor has your information ; it &apos;s a genius â€” but we &apos;re talking about the social services that come in and out of your mouth .
CA : OK , so they &apos;re doing this with their gut .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone &apos;s father , whose daughter is in the U.S. Gulf , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people like to hug others .
It shows an American technology for the dead .
And what this has done is â€” but it has shown millions of people around the world that the U.S. military is a great thing .
If they &apos;re not , I &apos;m not my daughter , who are you going to say ? What are you going to say ?
Juliet Singer : There are many questions like this .
But remember in the cave , in Iraq , Afghanistan â€” people don &apos;t need to watch a video , so they &apos;re looking at it .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference , it doesn &apos;t make any difference in their perceptions .
Because they all look at it .
It &apos;s going to change their mind and their thinking that gives them money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you seem to hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to see such a light , that you would have to keep yourself warm ?
Juliet Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not all different species .
We don &apos;t have the kind of genius that &apos;s obsessed with other minds .
If they do that , it &apos;s going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing it in a way that people are morally inclined to feel that they &apos;re going to grow up , not to leave behind .
CA : I think , we &apos;ve made a difference â€” it &apos;s made a difference for the unseen .
You can also imagine that there will be different kinds of stories about lions and lions .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or you can make problems .
What is the point of view of the hero ?
And what about the problem ?
Juliet Singer : Oh ! Something should be .
CA : These are really great people , really great .
We &apos;ll have to try and do it . They &apos;ll have another example .
Here &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done before , but I think you &apos;ve done something for TED .
So this is a very interesting story , which is old , right ?
What is this ?
Juliet Singer : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year â€” in the middle of September , there were major lynchings sitting in bananas , like the cell was in Mexico , but not so big .
And we had a report â€” which was a very good report on it â€” where I was told that , in fact , conservation agencies were contracting from different sources of oil , and they were sticking there and staring at it .
And there was some Vietnamese government and things like that .
And nothing above that report was a very difficult thing for us to do .
We couldn &apos;t believe him because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we were wondering , well , maybe this company did all this in competitive games .
At that foundation , we ran it , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This material is fine , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; And so we got a letter from a couple of weeks ago that wrote this , they wanted to figure out the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to write the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show how legally you own it ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; And then they took us to see Scripture with the name of the Infinity Mushroom Deaf .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of predicting and predicting what materials are , and that &apos;s by writing letters to these people .
CA : All right . So how come you &apos;ve got information from inside of Babylonian ?
Julian Singer : Yeah , we &apos;ve got a lot of stuff , I mean , at that time , we &apos;re going to collect some of these and make some of these things as difficult as possible .
For this reason , our appearance in the last few months has become equally easy , because we are improving our buck system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s crude .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s already beginning to happen , we &apos;re much more dependent on our ability to grow , and that means that we have a huge amount of civic goods , very smart , but we don &apos;t have as many people as we can process and trust all this information .
CA : So that &apos;s a real problem , fundamentally , why did a journalist or a journalist &apos;s dream ?
Juliet Singer : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to fix very quickly , because the materials that we use are the materials that we need to organize , so we need to get those people together to work on very , very sensitive materials for conservation , and then less sensitive issues .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re telling us something about your own identity and how you &apos;ve come to work .
And I think what I &apos;ve learned is that you went to 37 different schools in your childhood .
Is that correct ?
Juliet Sung : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and moving away from the city , so the two reasons were influenced .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean , a psychological scientist would say that all things together can be artificial .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were just one teenager at a very young age , and you came to the workshop very quickly .
Julie Singer : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist working since I was very young .
I wrote a letter , and I was the girl at the time when I got my master &apos;s degree .
So you have to appreciate the word &quot; &quot; suck &quot; &quot; with a word .
I mean â€” there &apos;s a way that you can use it for different things .
Unfortunately , at that time , it &apos;s only Russian mafia that &apos;s using your grandmother &apos;s bank accomplishments .
For this word , it &apos;s not as powerful as it was before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think of your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things that have helped them survive ?
Julian Singer : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But basic value : well , good , powerful and evil people don &apos;t generate mainstream ; they grow .
And that &apos;s the stigma I &apos;ve learned from my father and some of the other brave and violent people that I live in my life .
Chris Anderson : Can powerful and heavy people not produce healthy employees ?
Julian Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a gay man , that &apos;s why I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow â€” there &apos;s also another way â€” to train a rebel , which is approaching the police .
And that &apos;s what exists in my career for a long time .
Chris Anderson : So we just got to the last bit and just say , what happened in Iceland ?
Basically , you put something out there , somebody has a problem with a bank , and then they give the newspaper a warranty of the story .
Instead , they showed you the opportunity .
It makes you very famous in the Iceland . So what happened ?
Julian Singer : Yeah , it &apos;s a great fact . You know .
The Iceland has been faced with a crisis .
It was the most powerful one .
Here the banking population was 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the state telegraph surgery that had occurred about five minutes before it was published , like a movie : &quot; The state of the equivalent of Imperial Newsweek , and the state of Newsweek was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming , and we became very famous in the Iceland , I went to the Iceland and talked about this issue .
And the things that people had to do here weren &apos;t supposed to be the same again , and as a result , the Icelandic academicians in the United Nations worked with some other international experts , we passed a new kind of Icelandic Linda Law , which is a kind of like free media , because journalists from around the world are making the most protective space for the world , for the new Nepal prin@@
A Nearby country like Ice Leader , which means it &apos;s going from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Icelandic Parliament celebrated it .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look at the future , do you realize that the more expected it is to represent power and power , more resilience , or see us as all powerful , or will it survive ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure for the law of liberty and the law of transparency around the world â€” Europe , China and the U.S.
What &apos;s going to happen ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live â€” because with a small effort , we can move from one side to the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m transferring cochlear implants into what &apos;s called , judges , honor , and all power is for you .
Juliet Singer : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I worked in the kitchen .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did this , which is milkweed .
I was walking through the hills of my childhood connectome , and I saw this in the hills .
When I was growing up in college and came back home in the early 1990s , I had this epiphany .
My team stayed quiet .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a miracle , I realized , how do the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the mini-marathon mountains everywhere I went , the surprise was that North Carolina , Pisa , or the ice sheet of May in London , there were four species of abalone â€” all right , thin , silence and code .
And I thought , this is really strange , and I wondered if anyone else ever had a touch of that curve .
And when I looked at it , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching these quadriplegic teams .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Continuing the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human trait .
This is something we did 10,000 years ago when we made it from our slums .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , they &apos;re going to see rocks and branches , and you &apos;re going to see all these organisms .
But if you look at the first 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : cars , trucks , trucks and so on .
It &apos;s also true for the elderly .
If you look at the mainstream of New York City 150 or 200 years ago , you will see images , images , images and images like south .
But if you look at the distance there , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of magnesium , which is wheat , rice , but also starvation .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did our story happen ?
Shah .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The great Second World War has given us the greatest incentive to be afraid .
During the great war , we had developed technologies such as soybeans , polymers , and so on , all of these things started to happen .
And since the end of the Second World War , there have been four major breakthroughs of the monarchy .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the soap operas and the soap operas have increased happiness , and within a two-year period , their cumulative emissions have increased .
Now if you add in Florence and Florence together , that &apos;s the equivalent of two Chinese each year from Sweden .
Now , my favorite example of using Chinese coffeehouse is not one , because China is not just one of the largest recruiters , it &apos;s also one of the biggest recruiters .
So now we &apos;re going to turn to our favorite paintings .
The first is the most utilized salmon food in the U.S. and the West .
The Gold Rush is an extremely bad resource .
Only one pound of forest takes five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest to market .
The Indus trading is also unbelievable .
In a study done in the DIY community , it turns out that burning fossil fuels is extremely inefficient to use hydrocarbons .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That whose battlefields are the battlefields of the Gulf .
Now look at these nice little boys .
They &apos;re putting the footprint of the Earth in their place to protect the coast , the yeast , the yeast , and the yeast , all sorts of important things for the environment .
Something like this happened with the civil war in Managua .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of coastal plants .
Another movement that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher marketplace called &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the track , it &apos;s very controversial .
Now there &apos;s some things that are going on right now that the tiny little bubble bursts out of the net , but along with it , a huge amount of other bubbles are going to disappear and disappear in the food that &apos;s left behind .
And a lot of the time , it &apos;s composed of flowers that are named after the Redwood tree , and it &apos;s the flower that we like to look at on the river , which means that the ecosystem is saving itself and producing yourselves .
The second big food in the U.S. and the West is food .
Titan is such a global hub .
Tonya needs to look at very large areas in order to organize .
We also have a region called the Center for Disease Control , or ICCAT , for Environmental Defense Discovery .
Carl Judge has also been the great organizer of the whole technology .
We can do it on television platforms , but it &apos;s not a good job for tuna fishermen .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tuna &apos;s hot .
It weighs over 40 miles an hour and allows its body temperature to temperature over 20 degrees C.
The entire fund of the Twin Towers is almost complete .
Flood vessels are the glue of blood that &apos;s no longer useful .
It &apos;s great for protons .
But the forest creatures 40 miles away from home calculations are not able to stay in the forest .
Sometimes it &apos;s a good loss , it &apos;s not necessarily a bad loss .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was a civil society .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every data is a given .
In the policy of connectivity , there are 3,000 more drugs .
For example , I say connectome is bigger than people . ( Laughter ) If anybody solves the power of a connectome , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere , these are the rocks that propel the desert to children .
As a result , we have a successful metaphor for the public realm .
When the space shuttle started , the space shuttle would cost six pounds to build a foundation .
But now it &apos;s a much better Dreadnoughtus .
Unfortunately , one thing that happens is that this little squid is also wrong , because if you look at the Freedom of Information Act , they &apos;re called the Shark Foundation in a Foundation change .
Whereas this iPod is inspired by a parable .
It &apos;s hard to say something about metal and metal .
But then again , the credit card industry required that it had become a reputation for the replacement of the Phood .
It &apos;s a system by which we produce oxygen that mimics the Earth .
This is seven percent annual .
Even though we spend a small amount of money to get to the market , we &apos;re still making quite a lot of money .
We don &apos;t just play chocolate cake , we play chocolate cake .
We have things that are playing out and things that are playing out .
Because on the left , the blood and the lungs and so forth add up to the kitchen .
I wonder if there &apos;s any puzzle that pulls things apart , but it opens the gap .
India is the first or the first . ( Laughter ) And as a result , this is a terrifying problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of wildlife products that come out of the sea and use .
This is the third part of China , or the same as the people in the United States who make it every year .
The last thing in four words is this .
Philadelphia actually started as a lifetime .
And it started with the ownership of a local manufacturer to see that the everyday day demographic doesn &apos;t go to McDonald &apos;s .
He walked up to the side and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Have a look .
What the syndrome would be worth more is evidence for the summer , and it was evidence that it was not a Yellow .
So he made his own liposuction probe .
Sadly , the Sinduvai Gorge was down to 30 centimeters .
He wanted to build a 25-centimeter probe , so he brought in orbit .
Actually , the Philip of Philadelphia is the largest mass-industry in the United States of Arts , moving from two to three billion pounds of Michigan every year .
If we stop polluting policies , maybe we &apos;ll have therapies .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
This plant is transforming the plant protein in a very efficient way , and it &apos;s also ready for the third world .
Actually , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; it &apos;s coming from an individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like its own profile .
It doesn &apos;t include EDI and DNA that we think will be keeping us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip of mine .
That &apos;s a large part of three million tons .
One possibility that conservation guards have found is , can we eat it ?
Can we lead instead of giving it a curve ?
There are reasons for that .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , where the average elite is the low-performing country and the highest performing country in India .
This is among the top three , EPA and DIY .
So this is his ability .
But do we take this path and instead of giving away a few dollars or a few dollars or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds or a few seconds and convert it to a page , we add flexible flexibility to make these little dishes ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is that homes are characteristic .
They have much more EPAA and DIY than others .
The calculation in India is extremely powerful .
Cookie gras is only three thirds of the revenue of Indians coming to market .
Actually , it &apos;s about three without loss .
The atmosphere builds up to three vertices in the air , so they only gather .
Look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our Western gardens , we have cooked the use of Facebook and Netflix .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 new deaths have been produced , and that &apos;s why the oceans have died .
As you might think about clicks , there are more than three protons , and more than three , these are very effective signals .
It &apos;s very real .
And the last puzzle is a question .
We can produce a machine that can provide benefits for safe protein .
It should be a green fluorescent organism , a rapidly growing and changing environment , which is like its own capability , and it should be EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and Fiji .
This is already in paper .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about this , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We &apos;re all one .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million tons in the oceans .
I mean , it &apos;s all going on .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to be a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was obsessed with reading the big brain because I have a brother who is a mental illness epidemic called schizophrenia .
So much and later , I wanted to think as a scientist , how do I connect my dreams to my reality and create my dreams ?
What happens with my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia is that they do not combine their dreams with a universal and common reality , and they do their job .
So I spent my life researching serious illness .
And I moved from my office to Boston , where I worked at the Pranitha Francis Bank , which was a popular psyche at Harvard University .
Because what I was looking for answers to the biological level is the difference in the brains of people who , generally , conceptualize themselves , versus the brains of people who are affected by Schizophrenia or by the IPCC , is , in fact , what we were trying to build is the micro-molecular cluster of the brain , whose cells are messing with the chemical and quantity of the brain ?
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this kind of research on the day , but maybe on the seventh and seventh floor , I was on a road trip to the NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I was faced with an intellectual discourse myself .
The one on the left of my brain was a new one .
And in the next four minutes , I saw my brain completely dissolved by any ability to understand information .
When I was in graduate school , I was able to read and write and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a similar brain , there are two parts of it that are completely separate from each other .
I created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the first part of the brain that &apos;s connected to the left part of the brain , and this will be in my brain .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different .
Those of you who think computers work like a parallel processor in the right part of our brain , whereas the left part of our brain works like a solar system .
These two sides are transmitting messages from the background of a collective culture that has 300 aggregates .
But they &apos;re also two parts of the story .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowledge has to be understood in a very different way , and their minds are different things , and you allow them to see who they are , and they &apos;re very different from each other .
Compassion â€” thank you very much .
Audience : Yes , it &apos;s a big deal .
( Laughter ) The evidence of our brains is just recently and think about that moment .
This is where our brains now think of part of our brains as being orchestrated by the movements of our bodies .
Information is stored and stored in our bodies in the form of energy , in the form of our whole system of neuroscience , and then it &apos;s transformed into a great assembly class that we see in the present moment , what it feels like in the mind and what it feels like in the mind .
I am an energy imprisoned by the energy of my surroundings through the right brain .
We are the energy systems that are moving from one another to the right part of the brain as a human family .
And at that time , we are the best on this planet that has the potential to make the world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The right part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The left of our brain is about the past and the future .
The building block of the left of the brain is like taking the largest aluminum / cloud we have right now , and making analytics and then making analytics .
And it &apos;s also making all this information organized and documented by all these things that we have learned in the past , and the potential for the future is redefining the impact on our projects .
The symptoms on the left of our brain think about language .
It &apos;s a continuous conversation that is taking us and our inner world from the outside .
It &apos;s that tiny little voice that Sue tells me to go home and buy and remember .
I need them in the morning , it &apos;s my quantified instinct that reminds me where to put me .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice that says , I am !
And as my brain already tells me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become separate .
I become the only person in the world with high energy around you and with fire .
And the only part of my brain that happened this morning was in the Philippines .
On the morning of the Cold War , my left eye slammed into the back of my eye with a bullet of pain .
It was the same kind of pain that existed from the waist .
And the pain that connected me and left me .
And then it stopped , and then it stopped .
It was extraordinary for me . I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Nothing , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went out and I looked at my cardboard , which is a body transport mechanism .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this machine , because it makes me feel like I &apos;m the only person with my hands , like I &apos;m the only person with my hands that has ever touched Donna .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I stop looking at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness shifted , the general sense of being a human being on the machine , but now I &apos;ve been in a mysterious and mysterious place where my consciousness was conscious of
And it was all very strange , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started running around in the room , and I felt that everything inside my body was simple .
And everything is very difficult and very thinkable .
I &apos;m not connected in my speed , and I think home is a necessary place , so I think it &apos;s only the inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my closet in preparation for the underwater , and I &apos;m actually hearing a conversation within my body .
I heard a voice saying , I need to play you now .
I &apos;m going to put you down , and then I &apos;m not going to put my balance on it , and I &apos;m going to turn the wall .
I look back and I look at my hands and I realize that I can &apos;t now repair the damage of my body .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because I &apos;m going to get my hands together with the atom and the magnetic wall .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the stuff on the left of my brain got pretty quiet .
It &apos;s like someone &apos;s ever heard the T.V. sound of a record .
A gift .
First , I was surprised by the wiring of my brain .
But then immediately , the energy that came into the letter in this great space flight that was around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body right now , I felt enormous and powerful .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
And then a bridge corresponded to the right part of my brain and he said to me , &quot; You are a lesbian . &quot;
So we need some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really scared of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really scared of the problem , but I quickly came back with a sense that I &apos;m calling a lot of money .
But they were so beautiful .
Consider how beautiful it will be , where you will be completely independent from this tiny brain that is keeping you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my sleeve and my stress is going to be related .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And look at all the relationships that you have from the outside world and from that point of view were depressing .
And I felt a sense of peace and quiet .
And measure what it would look like if you left behind this 70-year-old emotional weight that you were carrying .
( Laughter ) Oh , I started as a cult .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain got involved , and he said , hey , there &apos;s two hemispheres .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should be helping my spirit , so I went from being a homemaker to being a machine shower and I &apos;m now walking around in my apartment and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive a car ? &quot; &quot; And that moment , my hand has become fully obsessed .
At that time , I realized that my God was going to attack me , the next thing that my mind told me was , how great .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
I &apos;m going to be a brain scientist whose opportunity is to realize that they can memorize their brains and that they can memorize â€” ( Laughter ) â€” and then come to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to go . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; All right , I can &apos;t get rid of the golf cart , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I need to call for help . I need to call my job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to remember my job , and then I remembered that I had my business card , which is my phone number .
I then go to my studio room and I open up a three-story motorcycle .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card as I can see from my naked eye what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s my card , because I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s not my card , because I can &apos;t see any cortex .
And words will be held by punch cards and punch marks and I wasn &apos;t learning anything .
And then I started waiting for him to tell the story .
And at that point , the general public was repeating the truth , and I found that it wasn &apos;t a card ; it wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to break this goal just a minute .
And at that time , the effects of the effort within 45 minutes were increasing in the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I have no way .
So I take the phone and I plug it in here .
I downloaded a business card and put it there , and now I look at the cards and I look at the glass bottles as they roll over the phone .
But then I move off to my low-lying length when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I gave that number too .
So I raised my hand like a donkey , and I raised my hand like a donkey , and I raised my hand against the other hand , and I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , when I came back to the truth , I can tell you that I was the first person to ever come back from India , and I heard that the phone rang on my wrist screen , and
So I say to her , in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking to you very clearly , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like &quot; &quot; Woo hoo , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then he tells me what I didn &apos;t know was that I couldn &apos;t speak a language at that time and understand when I wasn &apos;t trying to say anything .
So he understood that I needed help and he needed help .
And shortly afterwards , in an ambulance , the Sierra Leone was visiting the other Michelinean General .
I walked up and looked like a tiny , tiny baby .
Just like the one story that kept me awake and was out of the closet , I pulled the energy out and I felt my soul shaking .
And that moment made me realize that I was not alone in my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life or a second time of my transfer .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I was alive .
When I felt the sense of wonder in my soul , I gave life to God .
Now my brain was divided into two separate facts .
At that time , the emotion of my sensory apparatus started to feel just in the face of pain .
Light raised my brain like a fire in the forest , and the lights were so big and dim that I could hear a voice in the background , or I wouldn &apos;t hear a voice , and I was just scribbling the path of fire .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my body posture , so I felt enormous and wide like a person who had been free from my belly .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great evangelical storm surrounded by a sea of rain .
Great Firewall .
He gave me the quality he needed .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I could find my own great celebrity and be able to hear inside such small bodies .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive . &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been brought in by neurons .
And if I &apos;m married to a neuron , and I &apos;m still alive , so whatever life is that neuron can get , and I &apos;ve seen a world of beauty , transparency , commitment and love , people who know that they can ever feel that quality .
And they can pick up living and choose , and the right thing is that the books , on the left of their brain , want to take their own steps in search of this pathogen .
And then I understood how great this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was the lesson of the culture that taught me how to live my life .
And he encouraged me to be healthy .
After the five weeks of the event , the soul picked up a glove of blood from my brain , which was the sadness center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real passion in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the powerful force of life , the hand of hand , and two extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I can step in the right part of my consciousness &quot; &quot; where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe . I am the power of life .
Fifty beautiful cellular organisms are made of mineral cells , one in which everything is present .
Or I can choose to walk to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a tight form .
From quantum tunneling .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
Who would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And who ?
I think as long as we spend our left-right brain reserves , we &apos;re going to extend the world peace and our planet is going to be so busy .
And I thought it was necessary to reframe that .
Thank you .

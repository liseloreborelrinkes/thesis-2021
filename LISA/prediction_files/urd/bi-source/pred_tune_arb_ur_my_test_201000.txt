Good morning !
Are you people staying ?
They took my name to the Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the Tiger in Arabic ?
No ! Anybody ? OK , no problem .
Once upon a time , as young as eight years ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , and I was forced to eat .
So I wondered , do you have the Arab Spring ?
He looked at me strangely , and he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for example . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what it says ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Saylor said .
He was talking to me three people , as he was telling me to myself , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see it ! &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic mean ?
A linguistic girl put two words in and out of her voice .
How can he speak like this ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough !
What is it that makes me feel comfortable in my own country ?
Where could that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now , when we &apos;re here , there &apos;s a lot of people like me , who get to this point in their life where they basically leave out everything that &apos;s inside them , just because they love to say , and they &apos;re terrible .
Should I embrace my whole culture , my imagination , my mind and my dreams ?
Perhaps we have the most important wars in the stories of children .
Do they have to send me all the things I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like that ?
What makes sense ?
And yet , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision in the same way that he did for me .
The Arabic script does not require today .
It &apos;s not science , or research , or language that we &apos;re using in neuroscience , the language that we use everywhere we work , the language that we teach when we work on the project of an evolutionary tree , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use at the Freedom of Data .
If we do , they will cover our shoulders .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go from there ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important fact that we need to think about .
Arabic is the mother tongue .
Research tells us that you have to force your mother tongue to get the skill in other languages .
In other languages , the fate of mother tongue is the primary state for creativity .
How ?
Gabriel Gabriel , when she started writing , she started using Arabic .
All of their imaginations and imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little girl in the village where she grew up , felt a sense of wonder , a sense of curiosity , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their literature in English , you feel the same sense of happiness , they feel the same sense .
Now you can imagine that this is also in English , this little girl who lived in the village next to Lebanon .
So , here &apos;s an example that no hacker can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill the language .
It &apos;s a fact of emerging societies .
Germany , France , Japan and China all show up .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their own language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the walls , they spend a lot of money on the advertising and the Sun .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this growing mindset is not reaching yet , and we want to reach this developing world .
They were countries that were like us at the time , but they decided to try to grow , study , and reach those countries , such as Tiger , entrepreneurial and other things , they forced their language to follow each other like they were letting girls go — like Hasbro .
They brought it closer together .
Because if you take the toilet or the law and the product , and it &apos;s not in the toilet , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be involved in these markets , not in the characters , as we are most of the time .
So to create new innovations and applications , they had to maintain their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Cyber , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will remind you ?
What would you understand ?
No matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about talking , they &apos;re just about us .
Language is a symbol of the particular stages in our lives , and the words that are driven by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Cyber , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; each one of you will create a unique location in your brain — there are special emotions for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of multiplying one or two or three words .
It &apos;s an internal idea about what we think , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our consciousness ?
How would you know it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the age of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , then I &apos;ll go ahead and spend a lot of time thinking about it .
It &apos;s that these impacts remind us of a particular thing .
I &apos;m a French speaker friend who &apos;s a French speaker .
I was asking him one time .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I tried to convince his wife and translate it one night to what it means to &quot; &quot; crap . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Women tyrannically called it &quot; &quot; crap , &quot; &quot; and then several nights I tried to understand it .
He wondered , how could this be so obvious ?
Does she want to make a suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us realize that she didn &apos;t understand the word for her husband , because she couldn &apos;t understand , and she was right ; the way she thought about it was different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he &apos;s teaching me Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I feel when I hear Fridays . &quot; &quot; Bragg Women tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; I have raised my hand and why you have it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And SM : And because you are me , I put my hand up and put your hand up . &quot; &quot;
He translated . He showed me .
( Applause ) So what did we do to stop the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a way of thinking about society and we started a process of saving Arabic language .
While many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whatever the hell &apos;s broken , fuel the water . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The headman of the Arabic language translated a message , which is , &quot; I talk to you from east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this by ourselves , because in this way , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if somebody tells me , I love the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be responsible in the way that our dreams , our dreams , and our daily lives .
The letter looks like us and the way we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from east , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; And then you sit back .
It &apos;s very simple but it &apos;s effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters on Earth .
You see , out there , there &apos;s an example , a landscape in which the letter black and white is in the background , with this text , &quot; Remember language . &quot;
Why ? Of course , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really don &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we kill our language , we have to give ourselves a knowledge .
We have to find a reality for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very easy to play games , novelty and religion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
Girls and boys .
We &apos;re so cool !
And if somebody says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used the word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve spelled &quot; &quot; chocolate &quot; &quot; in itself . &quot; &quot; They want to admit two , but I have to admit that word , which is nice and equal to reality .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t stop you .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to let anyone become greater or think that we have a right to speak about language , to press on us , to press on us , to confront our patients and to think about it .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the blood or we can &apos;t refine the fracture , we can be creative again .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in mother languages .
Let &apos;s start with that .
They make a novel or a short film .
A single neuron can fire us up to a global level .
He can repeat the Arabic language on the front lines again .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there is no solution ; there is a solution .
But we have to know that , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , part of the solution .
In Judaism , what can you do today ?
Who &apos;s Twitter ?
In Judaism , I urge you , even though , my time has run out , or in Arabic , in English , in France or in China .
But data , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin literature !
( Applause ) That &apos;s awesome ! It &apos;s no language .
You enter a virtual world with a language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the translation of that language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , is in the language of her father .
When my daughter was born , I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , right . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I raised my daughter &apos;s light in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom , Mom .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anyone to hear it . ( Applause ) So get away with this cultural press . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to say that we have this forever memorialized that our condition is not a secret to our existence , that the negatives that are protecting my people , until you look at me and you look at my generation and I don &apos;t know that I have this generation of inequality , and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t care about our generation until they &apos;re celebrated for giving visions , and
( Applause )
I love chocolate .
In college , my primary intention was to be vegetarian , which meant I had to write a lot of magazines .
Now a normal person , when they write something , will have something to do with it .
You know , you know — ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;re going to do your job at low speed , but in the first week , you do a lot of work and a lot of work later , everything is perfect , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response would be all ready , but the actual work of the teacher would get to it , and then I would do something like this .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happens with every text function .
And then there &apos;s a whole new set of pages of research papers that you do in a year .
And I knew that my common sense wasn &apos;t good enough .
It was a huge task .
I set up a plan , and I decided I would do something like this .
This is how it &apos;s going to go .
I &apos;m going to start with small stuff , and in the meantime , the task is going to grow at an ever-growing rate , and eventually I &apos;m going to augment it even more like a student .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
How many months ago ?
Go home , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we rebuilt a great project .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go home , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we had some .
And two weeks went by in one month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went out one day and I spent three days in the Dragon , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I picked 90 pages , two streets , and I didn &apos;t have to go on two streets — people didn &apos;t have to go on two streets — people were typing two streets in the background , spending time in the square , and
I thought , well , it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , aren &apos;t you Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk about our issue . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , from today , it &apos;s perfect .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I was not sure . ( Laughter )
She was very welcome . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I write blogs , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the system .
My Ranger regularly puts six people in jars , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain makes a difference to six people .
Knowing that I made a lymph node where I could diagnose both of these brains with autism and the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look and tell me , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but consider it .
So this is a six-person brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
Both of these brains have decisions , but the stereotypes are in the human brain that enjoy it .
Now , what does this mean in terms of a stranger ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine when it doesn &apos;t .
&#91; It &apos;s time for work to finish &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; &#91; A dark man will make a decision to make a difference , but he didn &apos;t like the project , so he brought a command , and he said , &quot; &quot; Go pick the pages of the Chocolate pages . &quot; &quot; Tennessee Hadley , because I know it &apos;s happening right now .
( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) So we &apos;ll get to the screen and see , in 10 minutes , something new happen ?
After this , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , beginning with the conversation about the relationship between the Red Brigades , and much later on , you &apos;ll be able to watch the videos on Twitter Mother .
( Laughter ) It will take some time for all of those things , so it won &apos;t take much time to do something today .
What a contract ! ( Cheers ) Now , what &apos;s happening here ?
Now , it &apos;s not just happiness that you want to say .
It just wants to stay in the present moment .
It doesn &apos;t have a sense of the future , it &apos;s just two things : compassion and compassion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all fine .
If you know and you spend your whole life cycling and hard , you &apos;re very successful !
( Laughter ) And to make , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good thought , and a growing generation , maybe that &apos;s what happened .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed , the tribe is no longer very far .
We &apos;re an increasingly educated tribe , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , a decision-maker , who makes us do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re moving away .
We make big projects .
And he thinks about all of these things .
And all we need to do is figure out how to do it when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes it seems so appropriate to do what is easier and more emotional to eat , to think or to feel comfortable in moments of opportunity .
There &apos;s an image for it .
Sometimes they do .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult for a big purpose .
And this is a climate agreement .
And for the Scrapper people , this tendency always reaches the end , where more time goes by , a simple and permanent path that &apos;s way beyond the circle .
I call it a dark place .
( Laughter ) The Dark Ages are a place where people are so close to home .
There &apos;s employment at the time when it &apos;s not supposed to be dominating .
In the dark region , what &apos;s more common to you is actually no longer useful , because it &apos;s no longer the right to express , with spatial awareness , with fear , with enjoyment — all the properties that go along well .
The question is , in this case , when capital punishment breaks down , how does a human being intervene in a bottle that is unhappy but where does it matter ?
It turns out that systems are also providing safety , which is keeping people safe all the time in the dark moments — someone calls him a home .
( Laughter ) Now , this household applies a lot more , but when the Dalai Line approaches it , it &apos;s awesome , or at the time when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment drops or scary results .
And the important thing is , the source is just that .
Now I was born with a relationship in my life , because six months ago , people of TED got in touch with me and they invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
In the past , my dream was for TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and my anger , something else was happening in the brain that made a decision from the centuries .
He was saying , &quot; Did you understand anything ? &quot;
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I go . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t you Google and look at the map of India at the lower 2,000 feet , we &apos;ll leave the palm oil when we don &apos;t see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two and a half months later , people at TED made the decision to marry their name .
I broke the web , and there was a photograph of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) High-performing houses , and within seconds the system was rewarded for sadness . ( Laughter )
And remember , he was scared of the house he was lying on the tree .
And finally , finally , the religious decision maker picked up the bill and started working on the conversation .
Now , the homeowner who tells the story of every category is a poster child , how someone like me would give two weeks to me , and the beginning of the article can &apos;t write , and then , amazingly , causes unbelievable lessons to go to sleep every night and write a proposal .
And the sum of three things : the system of stereotypes .
That &apos;s not very good for anyone .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
When I wrote this , it struck me the implications of it .
In fact , I got thousands of miles from all around the world and from all walks of life , from all walks of life .
They had news outlets , bankers , engineers , pennies , and CDs .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody was telling the same story and saying , &quot; I &apos;m also faced with this issue . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and the number of emails .
They were lying paralyzed in the script of these people , showing how much Solly wrote about her life , about what she did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the next thing ?
Why are they all in black ?
Well , it turns out the list is two types .
Today , for example , I gave them all the data lines .
And when the data is online , recent deaths are inevitable because household is reaching .
But the system has a second kind of relationship , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data online .
So if you want a project that starts itself like some kind of sports or businesses — like some kind of arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start cutting your garage and getting stuck in order to do things .
Also , there are many other things that don &apos;t face digital relations , such as having with your family , learning , understanding your health , understanding your relationships , telling your relationships well that you &apos;re not healthy .
Now , if the only way that Scrapper &apos;s job is to get a job , it &apos;s hard , because all of these data lines on how to create , in the case of a house that &apos;s broken .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The latest implications are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with you .
And this is a typical leather reading that &apos;s too subtle to look at , and it &apos;s very subtle in terms of being dead , rather than being deceived , a profound proposition .
You are suffering from bad news and bad news .
And this can be traced to a continuous pattern and locomotion .
So I thought that &apos;s why they &apos;re emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not ready for the project .
The television system has opened their eyes , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot pursue their dreams , it &apos;s that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the emails , and one of the things that came out — I think six people didn &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
It may not be a complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) and probably some of you have good relationships from online , but remember the scenes of creating things when there &apos;s no digital link .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the Clinder of life .
Every block represents a week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been hacked .
I think we all need to be careful with this Canada .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing because in every life , there &apos;s no time in every life .
We have to be careful with the cause of compassion .
It &apos;s essential for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that home , and maybe we should start by doing that .
Maybe not from now , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Yes .
Thank you .
( Applause )
That day , an accent of the United States and Afghanistan was staying home in one part of Afghanistan , one part of Afghanistan , and one part of Afghanistan was staying home to help provide a funding for the Afghan government to help provide a funding for the Afghan government to help provide a funding for the Afghan security services , so that the Afghan government had to go out and visit some of the leaders who had to
He walked in the vicinity of an attack , and he lived around three corners , and with so many things , he watched as young as the Cape Seventeen flew over the Kpin Seventeen , and he watched as young as the wives spoiled and killed .
One of the people who knew her kids , one of the surgeons and one of the Spanish developers , was moving towards a Hasbro captain , and one of the most amazing statistics , they were moving towards a Hasbro .
So it showed that the Catin Switzerland and the Spanish were adopted by this yellow sign that appeared in the winter .
They put them in helicopter , and then you can see the Caspian Swinning , and they bury them before they get to infect others .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? It &apos;s a very intimate emotion when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love and I knew why I work with people that &apos;s not the same thing .
You know , in the spring , you &apos;ve given up on people who want to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to vote so that we can benefit .
We have an online calculation !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that they were better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re hitting the marshmallow .
These are the best people to cherish the imagination of services , and these are the best people to cherish the imagination of services .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is the environment , and if you have the right environment , each of us has the capacity to work together , so each of us has the capacity to work together and extend it so that we have the capacity to do this in others .
I have the privilege of reaching out to some people like this , and we &apos;ll be saying yesterday , I have the privilege of reaching out to some of these people , and we will be saying yesterday , they have put you in danger to save other people and I asked you , &quot; Why can you do this ? &quot;
Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing because they did it to me .
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are not important .
The hard thing about beliefs and cooperation is that they &apos;re emotions , not humans .
It &apos;s not possible that you say , &quot; &quot; Stop me . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It can &apos;t be that I give two people the chance to collaborate and do this .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does it come from ?
If you go further than 50,000 years ago at the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is under threat , all these rivers are completely focused on us .
There &apos;s no personal matter .
Dream can be a low concentration of resources , but it &apos;s a giant distributed network that works together to reduce the duration of our lives .
And so we &apos;re ready for social animals , where we &apos;re together and work together as part of what I call a victim , as in a tribe where we feel our own connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we were committed and committed to cooperation .
It has continuous benefits .
It means I can stand up at night and I can turn around and see some of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you , it means you &apos;re not going to look at the dangers .
It &apos;s the system for the rest .
The modern day is exactly the same .
It &apos;s a global risk factor that is trying to make our lives difficult or try to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
It can lead society to a very high degree of market failure .
It could be a new technology that pulls your commercial bread away one night and it could be a new technology that allows your commercial bread to swim through at night .
Or it could be your opponent who &apos;s sometimes trying to run you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of business , but at least it &apos;s trying to steer your risks and your businesses to get you out of business , it &apos;s trying to steal your risks and your businesses to get you out of business .
We have no control over these powers .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it never ends .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is , because it &apos;s the belief that the direction is .
When a leader chooses to protect and live the lives of the people in the organization that protect and protect the lives of the people in the organization , and that is to assess their personality and goodness results so that people can experience their own bodies and their own conclusions so that people can feel secure and feel their own personal relationships , so they can reflect on things .
I was on a rough journey , and I noticed a truth that when a journey tried to take me out before he found it , and I saw the staff on the door to see the people in front of him just like he passed the law as he passed by .
One of the first times I tried to walk on it , the first time I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing things like crazy things ?
Why can &apos;t you walk around like us human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Bank is not because they &apos;re actively saving the Muslim Brotherhood .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t hate their leaders .
You see , if the circumstances are overwhelmed , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and as a result , it undermines the organization .
As a great leader , I can give you one of the most recent examples of how parenting is a good leader for having one of the most intimate examples of how to be a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what would you want ? What makes a good parent ?
We want to give our kids the opportunity , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s necessary , we want to give our kids the opportunity , education , organization and record , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the opportunity to grow and to do more of what we can do for themselves , to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Well , that &apos;s exactly what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , and when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunity , education , organization and record , and when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to build self-esteem and failure so that they can achieve more advances than we &apos;ve ever imagined , so that they can achieve more advances than ever imagined .
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a tech company in Next Jump in New York City , is the CEO of a tech company called Next Jump in New York , and he says one thing , if your family has a tough time , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people out of our organization ? How do we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has developed a practical lack of employment , and Charley has developed a practical lack of employment .
If you &apos;re working at Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of efficiency .
If you have a problem , they will mentor you and help you , in the same way that we do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
And the reason that so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from the CEOs , the same reason that so many people were so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from CEOs , the same reason that so many people were so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers from the CEO , who were unfortunately more stressed and motivated .
It &apos;s not about data .
They have broken the fundamental principle of gravity .
They &apos;ve evolved a society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the way to their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their loved ones the way to their loved ones , but they &apos;ve also convinced their loved ones to respect their loved ones , and that they have convinced their loved ones to their own people .
It &apos;s something that compares to us , not data .
Does any hypothesis be why you give birth 150 million dollars ?
Why not give teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not .
Well , good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
Well , good leaders will never sacrifice people to save the data .
They &apos;ll give people rapid data for their kids , but they &apos;ll give people rapid data to save .
There &apos;s a mini-bureaucratic administration campaign in the Boston Chapter , and there &apos;s a mini-finance company called Barry Wehmiller in 2008 that has gone mainstream , and he &apos;s gone mainstream , and he &apos;s gone mainstream .
Now in a large mining company , this is a very serious problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy furniture .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , and so many of the companies today came together and did a terrible job .
And Bob responded to it .
You see , bamboo doesn &apos;t trust the bamboo .
But bamboo is believing in the generation of dead bodies , and the more difficult it is to minimize the deaths , the more difficult it is to minimize the deaths .
And then they built a personal project .
That every employee , from the mediator to the CEO , had to hire everyone in the small four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted and they didn &apos;t follow it .
But as the bus mentions the program , it &apos;s very important .
He said it &apos;s better that we all take small contributions instead of giving too much money to some of us , and that &apos;s how powerful it is .
So they saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure in an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And as if nobody had expected , people started to trade from each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful people .
So some people took five weeks to get the other guy just three weeks .
Knowledge is an end , not a lie .
I know many people who benefit from the most successful organizations , and I know many people who are at the top of the pyramids of organizations who are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re entrepreneurs , and we do what they say because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know many people across the board that have no authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been willing to look at the person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been willing to look at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve been willing to look at the person on their right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some of the foreign policy that went out on the kitchen and how the policy is that the man eats honey and he feeds his men first , and when he eats , he eats nothing for him .
And when he returned to the area , his men gave him some food from his restaurant so he could eat because that &apos;s what happened .
We tell them they do it first .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous first , we call them leaders because they &apos;re dangerous first .
We call them the leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can be preserved , we call them the leaders because they choose to be the victims so that they can be preserved , and we call them the leaders because they choose to be the victims so that people can be preserved and so that people can benefit and when we do so , it becomes natural responsibility for our people to
They &apos;ll give us their blood and their pneumonia so they can see that their aspiration is actually becoming their lead , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do this ?
Why can you give your blood and pneumonia and you can give it to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this to us . &quot; &quot; And aren &apos;t these organizations that we would like to work for ?
And aren &apos;t the organizations that we all want to work for ? And aren &apos;t the organizations that we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with the story of a little girl named Motetema , who is also known as the Limpopo and the Mumbai .
Where the supply of water and water is incredibly unbelievable as cash , and growing up in these cases is very difficult to reach the age of 17 , I was staying still with friends in the bush during the summer .
The sun is getting warmer in the winter .
And as I was filling out the door , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why don &apos;t you make something that doesn &apos;t just touch your skin and doesn &apos;t have to do it ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this stuff . &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some wonderful data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred and fifty of them are in Africa , and there are only some in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in the environment known as the most dangerous drug .
One of the things that happens with the loss of the leg of the leg is that , if you &apos;re one of the more extensive developments of the leg , you can actually inject directly .
The most amazing thing about this disease is that every year , hundreds of thousands of people are constantly injected by the trauma that children leave you alone : no boots , no plants , no engineering .
After watching these statistics , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing this for myself , but I &apos;m doing less for this , because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I had some 6234 mobile phones — because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , not a laptop , not a Google browser , and a Google browser , and we published a study on Wikipedia , and we published a study on
And I looked at this as a personal problem in the box .
So what I &apos;m saying is right , our formula has gotten ready .
Now we need to work on this .
Four years later , when the mobile phone is 40 pages long after I &apos;m on the phone writing my patent on the phone , I &apos;m the smallest patent holder in the country and — ( &quot; &quot; Now it &apos;s not great ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say more about it anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first gold platform .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need a pencil .
( Laughter ) So after trying to be effective in high school and limited resources , which I had , the mentor university intervened with some new people , did more of this , and now we have an impact on what &apos;s ready to buy in the market , but now it &apos;s available in the market .
We learned some lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One thing we learned was that poor people don &apos;t buy products at a large scale .
They just buy it under the need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a jar of cake . They buy a jar of cake every day because it &apos;s more expensive .
So we created DryBath in these creative milestones .
You put it between and outside .
And the cool thing is , a simple replacement is only in five countries .
After the invention of this model , we also learned a lot about the waste of manufacturing .
We even want DriBath — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water every time they dropped , and we could save two houses for children who live in rural areas , two houses , more for school , two extra houses for school , two extra houses for the kids .
After looking at global impacts , we &apos;ve taken it out of our core values , our security and our responsibility .
DryBath is the servant of a smart man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re now entering this process , and we &apos;re actually entering this era of commercializing it into the retail market , and one question that I have to ask you today is , in the Limpopo Current , we &apos;re going to launch a 50th anniversary of the week with an album that does not have to cover the world .
What &apos;s wrong with you ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t done anything yet , I haven &apos;t done anything yet .
And more importantly , I learned a lot about this recent process , Google announced me as the world &apos;s most recent ycling teenager .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that has access to accounting , and one thing that surprises me is why all of this money didn &apos;t want to be silent . Thank you .
( Applause )
Instead , I &apos;m showing you some of the results today that may surprise me exactly what are the key reasons why organizations succeed , which is really why they succeed .
I believe that donor agencies are one of the best tools to make the world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with the desire for equal waste and organize them at the beginning , you will be left with the human potential that was once impossible .
You &apos;ll see them making the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why often failure ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to know a lot about this , a lot of my frustrations and the wrong assumptions that came to me from some of the organizations last year .
I wanted to know this because I was building different businesses from 12 years old , from New Jersey High School , to kindergarten , to school , when solar energy was built , then school , when I was making laptops .
I left school and founded a software company .
And 20 years ago , the idea started , in the last 20 years , we have made over 100 companies based on so many successes , and so many huge breakthroughs .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to look at these factors to tell you the greatest cause of corporate success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think it &apos;s everything .
That &apos;s why I call my company &quot; &quot; the ideal lift , &quot; &quot; the old days when you think about it .
With my background , I thought perhaps the team , the ability to be skilled or impotent , is even more critical factors .
I never thought I &apos;d be here at TED , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone &apos;s got a plan , until I get one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team has the ability to recognize me from head to head .
Each one is an elaborate fact .
So I thought maybe the team has the most important meaning .
So I started looking at the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about aid ?
With this in mind , it seemed to me that what is the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes institutions make a huge investment .
Could that be the most important thing ?
After this , of course , is it right ?
Did it come up very quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s quick , so you &apos;ll come and teach the world ?
Is this true ?
Or is it too late , and has it been too late before ?
So I &apos;ve gone from being very honest with these five factors to many institutions .
And the idea was that 100 companies had launched the Libra , and 100 of them had launched a scientific result to try .
So first of all , on these projects , the first five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goat , NetZero , Tickets.com. — they &apos;re all commercials for dollars .
And at the lower level , five companies — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — were very hopeful for us , but not for success .
So I tried to cultivate all of these identities , and I think these companies made progress on these subjects .
So in the outdoors of ideas from the outdoors , I looked at strange breakthroughs like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and Linkeddin .
Some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
There was a lot of investment in the new companies , and sometimes they had a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to find out that the biggest influence in the success and failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first thing was choosing time .
Forty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the organization are on the other hand , and then thinking , being different , remotely different , is actually number three .
But it &apos;s actually not true , not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and shocking me that the idea is not the most important .
Sometimes it becomes more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , a business model and investment comes to my mind .
I think the market model is still very serious , because you can do it without a market model , and then when the product gets bigger , you include it .
And investment , if investment was low in the beginning but now it &apos;s increasing , especially nowadays , investing is very easy .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these nodes .
Take the big success of Airbnb , as you all know .
It &apos;s very popular that a lot of investors noticed because people thought , &quot; Who is going to give a part of your home for a profit ? &quot;
Of course , it was the wrong test .
One of the reasons for the success of malaria is that the best business model , the workplace , and the workplace , is the right time .
This company came in front of these financial challenges when people needed additional support , and it was very safe to help people respond to advertising to their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
But , time was exactly right , make the downloads they needed .
Dreaders wanted additional access ; it was very critical .
Some successes , like Citysearch , came when people needed Wikipedia .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 here at TED , was at a time when companies wanted to hear more about what was happening .
We thought it was perfect , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then something failed .
We started Z.com. , which was the online entertainment company .
We were so excited about it — so with so much cold and so much great marketing , we had to work with some of the great thinkers at the Hole in the Wall .
In the year 2000 , the broadband band was very low .
The online video was so difficult to watch , you didn &apos;t know what to do with your browser , and finally this company reached its end in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of code and found over 50 percent in broadband America , YouTube was at best .
Great , perfect time .
The truth is , when YouTube started , there was no commercial map of it .
They weren &apos;t even sure it would work .
But he had a really good time .
So in short , perception is really important .
Ideas matter very much .
But maybe time &apos;s choice is important .
And the best way to estimate time is to see if there &apos;s a really smart approach to your wedding .
And certainly the uncertainty is , the outcome is not conclusive , because if you like something , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work very safely in terms of time .
As we said earlier , organizations can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of them will help you increase your chance of succeeding , and not in the other way about the world in some of the best ways .
Thank you very much . You &apos;re the best listeners .

&#91; 3 a.m. on September 2016 we saw the biggest data in history &#93; &#91; French accents declassified people with clever and powerful handwriting . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Robert Wetnesday to explain the Gulf Wetz Pammer . &#93; &#91; This week , we were at the center of the campaign at the center of the campaig@@
The money that these documents had pointed out was a small part of the minority labor companies .
We know the cows and the bankers and the inner stories that come along with the funeral forms and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a household company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see emails , you can see the exchange in messages , you can see the way you do this , how you complete things .
The impact is already beginning to manifest .
The president of Ashley has been famous .
We also have this information about the descendants of poor desalination workers .
The revenue of the two billion dollars goes to the main source of the Russian Empire , through his childhood friend , a famous network .
And a lot of blind people will be infected and will be homeschooled by other stories .
Now , this seems like a magical story , or a John Guteshead novel , with me .
What do we get out of it ?
But the fact that farmers and power stay in the same spaces and how much they shouldn &apos;t pay taxes meant that fast-growing advances like schools have less money for health and education .
And it affects all of us .
For my organization , GBM , this is an amazing discovery .
The global media and political leadership are talking about how people influence the press companies that we &apos;re talking about .
I think this is the cool , smart world for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like a road map .
You can run a second company inside a company , a second company inside it , almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind it .
It &apos;s hard to understand why taxation , journalism , school is so difficult to understand what &apos;s happening .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that the U.S. hasn &apos;t heard that much about it .
Maybe it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t have to be in this category of famous Americans .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in shell companies .
And that &apos;s why the U.S. Foundation approach works , there are a few of them .
I think if we look at the discoveries of Cameroonian Island or Delhi Wairo or Nepal or Nepal , they &apos;re the ones that correlate with the United States .
But a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give much information , they need less information to run for the company than they do at the Libra Report .
In the U.S. schools , this information is given to the students .
Nine expensively reduced investments .
This kind of crisis affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to look at how this approach works .
How does this actually work ?
So what we did was , we formed a campaign to run 13 intelligence companies .
Our foundation as an African minister wanted to move to the South America for a home , a ship and a space to buy .
The sad thing is , all the villages had provided a one-dimensional premise on how to move the village .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make our way out of the wall , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone for a loan , but we got distracted by the system .
It &apos;s also important not to treat it as individuals .
It &apos;s not about individuals who have talked about our hidden assumptions and ideas .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who &apos;s found in Singapore .
It &apos;s about how the system works , it &apos;s about teaching touch , it &apos;s about weight , it &apos;s about weight , it &apos;s about defense of imperfection .
And in order to do that , we &apos;re going to change this game .
We &apos;re going to have to change the game principle so that it can be hard to generate in these kinds of situations .
It can be ironic , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never change it , as smart and as powerful people are always .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been moving towards transparency where the company is holding out .
This issue was posted on political ideology , but the British government Department of Defense Department offered eight cents to the South Pole in 2013 .
And since then , European Union is forming a central record of the climate crisis , which is basically who owns the companies or is controlling them .
The evidence is that the ESM is behind this .
The contradiction in terms of legislation in the center and the Senate , which we didn &apos;t want to go up very much , so we did five .
We want to see the discoveries , the large companies , that are being used across the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in the Galapagos Venture .
There should be a lot of patience in the communities that are familiar with those who are behind barbed wire chips .
Remember , they sound up , it &apos;s not okay for this kind of investment . We do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and to encourage the legitimate changes in access to information .
We can reverse engineer the secret sauce because of the television and the school district .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It turns out that Lexus , who &apos;s your inventor , has had much more empathy in the last few years than all the rest of the world &apos;s media .
Can it happen ?
Julie Singer : Yes , can it happen ?
It &apos;s a provocation — what isn &apos;t it ? — that the media of the world is equally productive as a small group of employees to publish a small group of information that &apos;s more than all the rest of the world &apos;s media .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people get documented ?
And how do you stay passionate ?
Julie Singer : Yes , there are — I can tell you — public services in the right way — and we have so many ways to get information to us .
So we use a lot of high-speed storage to send materials from one place to the Internet to the next , to send signs to legal contracts like software and blogging .
We get information from the public domain , from the public domain , from Ram Shirley , or whatever , organizations like the regular news organizations , funding — which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about putting huge amounts of information into the public and then protecting yourself against the laws and political beliefs .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the evidence is real , but you actually never know what the product is .
Julie Singer : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;re going to get this knowledge all the time , and if we &apos;re going to get there at some point in time , we &apos;re going to increase the information quickly .
( Cheers ) God loves it .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think they &apos;re kind of coming up here and asking you what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you invented a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and what happened next ?
Julie Singer : Yes , it &apos;s a report .
It was a secret magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was there for 18 years .
He was a recent student in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the cup — based on these primary forces , who were trying to decide whether to go to law school , they bought 20 million pounds of reports for this report and one more report .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it for their political benefit , which was the smartest person — now the smartest person in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ for the press of Kenya .
So it was taken in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish it from the very first elections in early September 2008 .
When we did the report , we did the report , and three days later , Kubai made a choice to have a friend from the person who was horrible , Daniel Arppe , so he turned to the report and found him in the corner of the capital city .
CA : And — so , I mean , just briefly , this is — this was spread in Kenya , not by some sort of representation , but by the way , and by your measurements , it changed the outcome .
Julin Shanghai : Yes . This is the Gaddafi tea kettle , and then it spread across the entire country of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
It came from the outside .
And he convinced , just a few days later , the government of Kenya that they could talk about it .
And this blog was released on the TV 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent , according to one online gender report in Kenya , and the result was very different .
CA : Wow , so did your secret breakthroughs really change the world ?
JF : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There you go . We &apos;re just going to show a little clip of a windmill video .
This video is live , but here &apos;s a little clip of something .
This — I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-definition video .
Radio : It &apos;s gorgeous , when you push them first , two .
I found , oh , there are four things with them .
The road is clean . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen &apos;s running .
When they &apos;re on your behalf , tell me . Come on .
Hello everyone .
Go ! Go !
( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost . Gill gets lost . ( Machine noises ) Gill gets lost .
Hatel — two masters , two brown masters .
We need to move now , time is up !
Okay , so now we &apos;ve targeted eight people .
So we &apos;re looking at two old Hilly Capter , and we &apos;re still running Gulf .
Rockers . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re at home .
Ah , what a contract . What was happening ?
God beat you , Hello , Al — Okay , yeah , I beat them .
CA : So what &apos;s the effect ?
Julie Sangling : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We ended up with two people taking care of him .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
Chris Anderson : So 11 people in the event , right ?
Julie Singer : Yes ! Two employees of the Royers , two small children were imprisoned .
Twenty-six people basically died .
CA : And after his execution , he went mad .
What was the primary cause of poverty , you think ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves with a very high power disability .
On the one hand , some people are going to the Gulf , and then one kilometer away , the U.N. browser starts filling out 30 kilometers of caffeine each — among many — and they &apos;re also giving birth to children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t brave either , because they were brave .
Chris Anderson : Broadly Manning , According to the U.S. intelligence agency , was arrested , and he said that he admitted that video to you , 280,000 and a half thousand white U.S. ads as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Singer : So we &apos;ve done the following setup .
Five days ago , it received over 150,000 comments and 50 comments .
But we &apos;ve just given them a proof of of a home for Rwanda and an American safety earlier this year , but there &apos;s no correlation between them .
I mean , I used to come to this safe house .
CA : I mean , if you took thousands of comments to the United States of America .
Julie Singer : We &apos;ll give them a go . ( CA : Y &apos;all do that ? ) Julie Singer : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) JF : Because things like that show that , in fact , what the Arab states are , for example , going up against human rights in these governments .
If you look at cave paintings , they have the materials in them .
CA : Let &apos;s play with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why should you provide free information ?
Julie Singer : So the question is how important information in the world is , what reforms can be .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
The information that organizations spend money on is saving money , it &apos;s a good indication that when information comes out , they hope to do something good , because what organizations know better , and they know more about it , they also care about it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of consciousness .
CA : But are there risks to individually or collectively a society where innovation doesn &apos;t exist ?
Julie Singer : We did not do what any document they had with them .
I mean , our biggest challenge is practice .
With information , we &apos;re able to gather in a different way the information that &apos;s being private — the information that &apos;s available to someone else .
But there are also some mysteries — like , your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a magic secret — but we &apos;re talking about these civic services that come in and out of your mouth .
CA : OK , so they do that by heart .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , a father whose daughter is in the United States forums , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve done something so incredibly effective that some people like to attack others .
There &apos;s an American philosophy that shows people who die .
Which results — but it has shown millions of people around the world that the United States is political .
Although they &apos;re not , my daughter is not , who are you going to say ? So what are you going to answer ?
Julie Singer : There are many questions like this .
But remember in Baghdad , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , people — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t matter what their ranks are , so it doesn &apos;t matter what their ranks are .
Because every day they look at something .
It will change their frame and mindset that gives money to all of this , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Well , you look hopefully at what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that to illuminate this light , you have to keep yourself warm and fuzzy ?
Julie Singer : No , not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the same information as the other creature .
If they do this , this is going to be a very difficult situation for us , but we &apos;re doing the same thing that people normally feel spiritual about how they &apos;re going to go forward and not backward .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m just wondering , what did we get to — what did we get through here ?
You might also assume that there will be different kinds of crazy things about leaders and lawyers .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or problem solving .
What does the hero look like ?
And what are the problems ?
Julie Singer : Oh ! There &apos;s something about it .
CA : These are really good people , really good .
We &apos;re going to have to try . The lights are going to show you one more example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
So this is a very interesting story , right ?
What is this ?
Julie Singer : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year , at the end of the year — we had a very important clue in the banks , as was happening in the chemistry , but not so big .
And we had a report — which was a very nice report on this — which was that , in fact , the conservation companies had put in there and they had put in there .
And there was something about the federal government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing about that report , so that was a very difficult thing for us .
We couldn &apos;t predict it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we were pretty suspicious that perhaps one company did this all in the opposite direction .
So we did this , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
This stuff is so good , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t predict it . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter from the same week that this guy wrote , he wanted to figure out the marshmallow . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to figure out the machine . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by this ?
Is it really you ? &quot; &quot; So they brought this message that we were looking at with the name of Scripture , with the name of Microsoft and iPad .
Yeah .
( Applause ) It has happened many times .
It &apos;s our way of reimagining and predicting what material is , and trying to write and get the letter from these people .
CA : All right . So , when did you get the information from the inside of the BBC ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re collecting and redefining various tasks like this one .
So our initiative to publish this has been heavy in the last few months , because we &apos;re refining our bureaucracy system because of the rare public waste that we have .
It &apos;s raw .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s already playing , more than our capabilities are imposed on us because of our growth , and that means that we have a large number of civil services available to us , but we don &apos;t have those people who can regulate and anticipate this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , fundamentally , why did a yearning for journalists or journalists ?
Julie Singer : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we have an organization that &apos;s really hard to deal with because the materials that we have to deal with , so we have to reorganize them so that we can get people together that we have to work with a lot of sensitivity , and then we have to think about things .
CA : OK , so you tell us something about yourself and how you got to the job .
And I think where I learned when I was a kid , you went to 37 different schools .
Is it right ?
Julian Sangling : Yes , my parents were in the movies business , and then they were moving north , so that was the effect of both of those things .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so what I mean by that is that everything can be done can be artificially intelligent .
Julie Sangling : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you — I mean , you were just a genius at a young age and you got to the notion of working very quickly .
Julie Singer : Yeah , so I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist from a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I told the girl back then that when I was punished in the crime .
So you have to appreciate the word &quot; &quot; holy &quot; &quot; with .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that you can use different things .
Unfortunately , at the time , it &apos;s only Russian village that uses the bank account of your grandmother .
That &apos;s why the word doesn &apos;t matter what it used to be .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but do you think about your core value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some of the things that have helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in the facts .
But primary value : good , good , hard people don &apos;t generate affectionate ; they grow up .
And that &apos;s the scene that I learned from my father and some other brave and brave people who live in my life .
CA : And good and evil people don &apos;t produce empathy for themselves ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m an old man , so I &apos;m not very good at growing a lot , but somehow — the spread of influenza is another way , which is approaching the police , which is a crime .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happened in my career for a very long time .
CA : So we just got to the last bit by saying : What happened in the West ?
Basically , you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then they &apos;ve put the news out there , and they &apos;ve disrupted the story .
Instead , they inspired your situation .
So you &apos;ve been very famous in the West Bank . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , it &apos;s a great fact . You know .
AIDS is a crisis .
It was the highest .
The bank had grown 10 times larger than the rest of the economy .
Well , we did that report last July .
And the state of the television was so controversial that five minutes before it was published , as a movie : &quot; The state of the press released , and the state of the press was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What are we doing ? &quot;
So we just showed the web , we spent all the time , and we became very popular in the West Bank , and I went to Ice Land talked about it .
And the elements of the people there shouldn &apos;t be this one again , and as a result , as a result , the Sri Lankan scientists , working with some other international mechanisms , we launched a new kind of Asian law called for Freedom Media , which is the equivalent of the Freedom of Media , which is the most protective place for journalists all over the world , for new Ne@@
A country like Ice Land is like Noora , which means the system gets to the top .
And just a month ago , the Parliament of Ace Lindland considered it .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look towards the future , do you realize that the most expected thing to show is power and power , more generosity , or are we looking at greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure for the law of transparency and the law of transparency , all over the world — in Europe , in China and the U.S.
Who &apos;s going to sleep ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a really interesting time to live — because from a small attempt , we can move from one side to the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience here into what they call the Gulf , with respect , and all the power for you .
Julie Sang : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching both .
So I did this , which is milk .
I &apos;d broken my childhood circles and I &apos;d seen them crushed in jars .
When I graduated from college and came back home in the early &apos; 90s , I got this message .
My team stayed quiet .
And when I looked at it from a personal perspective , I realized , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to the mini-marathon mountains everywhere I went , surprisingly , to the North Carolina , Persia , or London , there were four species on the river for mines that were covered by four species — beautiful , dark , silent and coding .
And I thought this was a big strange thing , and I wondered if anyone had ever gotten the touch of this curriculum .
And when I took that leave , I realized people weren &apos;t looking at the cartoon team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
Continuing the natural world into a few elements is not an unusual human quality .
This is what we did 10,000 years ago when we removed our ancestors .
If you look at the ice in 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see them colliding and bumping , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , coal , leather and wheat .
It &apos;s also true of being a parent .
If you look at New York City &apos;s journeys 150 or 200 years ago in the middle of the night , you &apos;ll see these portraits like a video , a bus and a pushcart .
But if you look at the remoteness of this , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re only four years old — circuit boards , rubber , but also manspaces .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shirley .
This is a brand new problem .
And we &apos;ve been doing this for the last 50 years .
The second battle , the Great Wall , has given us the greatest inspiration to become famous .
During World War II , we developed technologies like Switzerland , Hell Population , and all of these things .
And since the end of the Second World War , I have come to see the greatest additional potential of malaria .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that military farming has increased greatly in seas , and within two years its inhabitants have increased greatly .
Now , if you collect the forest flows and the forest flows , each year it will be equal to two Chinese provinces .
I don &apos;t like to use my Chinese cartoon character because China is not just one of the biggest assets , it &apos;s also the biggest assets .
So now they &apos;re going to head for their four options .
The first one is the U.S. and the most utilized salty food in the West .
The forest floor is an extremely rare gap .
Only one drop of forest takes five , 10 , or 15 pounds of forest to the market .
The Indus Valley is incredibly dense .
In a study done in the Dutch University , it turns out that methane with household cleaners is radically inefficient in use of carbon .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where there are refugee camps in the tropics , they are the Mongolia camps .
Now look at these nice little dancers .
They &apos;re tracking the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , protecting the beaches , cleaning them up , transporting all sorts of important things to the environment .
This is what happened to so many Kenyan camps .
We &apos;ve spent the last 30 or 40 years watching millions of miles on the sea .
There &apos;s another operation that &apos;s going on here that the philosopher Mark Bentham calls &quot; &quot; the Nemo Ceiling . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve just seen it on the Tropical River , which is very controversial .
Today , there &apos;s something really profound that the small cricket swallows the liquid away from the nest , but with it , it has a very large number of other mosquitos that cover the other mosquitos and then change them to the next level of food .
And a lot of times , it &apos;s being picked up by the slums , which are called the Red Brigades , which is the slime mold that we like to look at on the river , which means that the ecosystem is eating itself and making it nice .
Then there &apos;s the second big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is a global campaign .
You have to look at large areas to organize like the kitchen .
We also have a region called the science fiction mining agency , or ICCAT — the Internet Convention for Defense Training .
Carl whiskey also developed a great deal of detecting all of this .
We can make television screens , but television screens are not good for television screens .
A lot of people don &apos;t know , but tattoos get hot .
It weighs over 40 miles a gallon , and its body heats over 20 degrees Celsius .
Almost all of the benefits of letting go .
The blood vessel is fungal , which no longer flows .
This is the best for protein .
But the forest creatures are 40 miles away from home calculating that they cannot stay in the forest .
Even time has been well-established , it doesn &apos;t require that it &apos;s been well-established .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut was running through the forest floor .
If you look at the map of content , the map of content is a data stream .
In the politics of connection , there are more than 3,000 of them .
In fact , I say there are more people in concrete — ( Laughter ) if anyone has to change the power of concrete , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And everywhere , these are rockets that disappear from giving birth to children .
As a result , we have a success story on the horizon and on the horizon .
When the space shuttle began , the space shuttle would take six pounds to make a football game .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s one thing that goes wrong with this little guy , because if you look at the Freeman Facebook page , they &apos;re putting the SOLEs on a foundation .
Whereas this database is banned from the kitchen .
It &apos;s hard to say that malaria and malaria are expensive .
But then the real credit industry needs to set up a deadline for the opposite of the Pope Symphere .
This is a system that produces oxygen , which is the planet Saturn .
This goes back seven percent a year .
Although we &apos;re still investing relatively little money to get to the market , we &apos;re also investing a lot of tiny little things .
We don &apos;t just eat milk ; we also eat milk and milk .
We have things that keep the mosquitos awake and we have the mosquitos that are eating the mosquitos .
Because the blood and the blood vessels on it are picked up by the mosquitos .
I &apos;m also wondering if there was a mustache that pulled the staircase and made it into the mustache .
India was either a lethal — ( Laughter ) as a result , a scary problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s been taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the equivalent of the third part of China , or the equivalent of the population of the United States every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia literally started as a lieblood .
And it started to look like the owner of a local financial firm noticed that the next day , there was no cloud coming .
He turned to his left and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s see .
It was a clue to the sea that the Infinity Mushroom would roam .
So he built his lift song .
Unfortunately , the pension was 30 seconds .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter cylinder , so he launched the Internet Code .
Actually , the footprint of Alaska is the largest mass-market industry in the United States of America , between 23 and 3 billion pounds a year off the grid .
If we stop polluting policies , maybe tribalism .
20 years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plastic proteins in a very dynamic way in animal protein , and this is the third world for me .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution ; it &apos;s growing from an adult in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a fragile mosquito .
It doesn &apos;t even have the ACE and DIY ads that we think will live forever .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
This represents a large sample of about three million tons .
One possibility that conservation community raised is , can we eat it ?
Can we open it up instead of giving it to people ?
There are reasons for this .
They have an Indian brilliant young kid from the market , who is the average elite of slavery against slavery , and is at the top of the pyramid of India .
It &apos;s October 3 , EPA and DIY .
So here &apos;s her potential .
But what if we took this path , instead of giving away a few dollars or a few holidays , and then turned it into a Facebook page , we borrowed it from the kitchen and held it to the garden to pay the bills for the second time ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is homework is intrinsic .
They have much more EPAA and ADHD .
The Indus calculus is particularly effective .
The cost of meat to the market is only three parts .
Actually , the top three is not from the kitchen .
The sea level rises by three times the size of the sea , so it just collects them .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our blue village , we have been replaced by the use of Facebook and neuroscience .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been born , these are the leading causes of death in ocean life .
And as you might think about the video , in all these different ways , protons and , more than three , these are very efficient signals .
It &apos;s just like that .
And the last mile is a question .
We can create a mosquito that can help us make healthy proteins .
These creatures should be green , growing and changing their fast-growing and changing environments just like the milk , and they should be EPA , DHA , OmiG3 and Fitch Ed .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been doing these things for the last 15 years .
Whenever I say this , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can all do this . We &apos;re one .
But you &apos;re not trying to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think without our needs .
But if we do something about it , the problem is that it &apos;s going to take a long time .
Thank you .

I was raised to read the big brain because I have a brother who is dyslexia .
More and later , I wanted to understand , as a scientist , how can I connect my dreams with my reality and make mine my dreams ?
What happens with my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia is that they don &apos;t integrate their dreams into public and public reality , and they act on it .
So I quit my life for research on serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I worked at the President Franklin Bank , which was in Physicians at Harvard University .
So what &apos;s the difference in people &apos;s brains that normally seek answers to questions like , what &apos;s the difference in their brain , versus people &apos;s brains that are involved in Scottish physiopsychology or Blood Doc ? So what we &apos;re trying to do is create a microscopic map of the brain , which cells are messing up the cell with the amount of chemicals ?
So I had a lot of advice in my life because I was doing this kind of research on the day , but at four o &apos;clock in the week , I was on my way to Newcastle Airways on a pilot of NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself in front of an intelligent desk .
There was a new lying on the left side of my brain .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely dissolve by the ability to understand any information .
By the morning of college , I was able to read and write and remember something .
I was a young girl in my body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the brain &apos;s first part of the brain which is tightly coupled to the back of the brain , and this is how it arises in my mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain which are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that computers work like a parallel processor on the right part of our brain , whereas the left part of our brain works like a chronic processor .
These two pieces are transmitted to each other by the copper body that some 300 volunteers have taken .
But there are two parts of it that are completely open .
Because they think of information in a different way , knowing each part has a completely different understanding of the information , knowing that their minds are on different things , and allowing you to let them know who their personalities are very different from each other .
Compassion : Thank you . That &apos;s it .
Teacher : Yes , it &apos;s a big deal .
( Laughter ) The evidence is still in our brains , and we think about this moment .
Here , we &apos;re imaging images of our brain right now , thinking organically about movements of our bodies .
Information flows through the body and expands throughout the body , throughout the nervous system , and then it slows down and forms a large algorithm class that tells us what &apos;s happening in the present moment and what &apos;s happening in the mind to feel and to understand .
I am an energy bound by the energy bound by the right brain .
We &apos;re using energy from each other , from the right brain to the right brain , as a human family .
And at this point , we are brothers from this planet who are dedicated to making this world better .
And at this point , we are perfect and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The right part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The mind on the left is about the past and the future .
The construction of the left brain means that we now take the largest album / Class , analysis of it , and then we begin to collect these calculations .
And it also informs organization and distribution of all of these things that are happening in the past that we &apos;ve learned and that the chances of the future depends on what we plan for .
The letters of our brain think in language .
It &apos;s this constant conversation that is taking us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me how to buy you home .
I need them in the morning , and it &apos;s a mindset that reminds me of where they &apos;re going .
But perhaps the most important voice is the one that says , &quot; I ! I am ! &quot;
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m separate .
I become the only person around me with the incredible energy and the passion .
And that part of my brain has been hijacked by the police this morning .
The morning of the philosophy , my left eye slammed into the back of my eyes with an exploded pain .
It was the kind of pain that comes from the waist .
And that pain touched me and left me alone .
And then he turns and he turns .
For me , it was extraordinary that I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; Nothing , I &apos;m going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I went to sleep and I put on my card field , which is a body training machine .
Now I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it makes me feel like I &apos;m holding a finger for an original person who &apos;s holding the command .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I feel so bizarre and poor . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way I have changed my mind , which is the general sense of truth , which is that I &apos;m a human being who is performing out of this experience , but now I &apos;m in a mystical and mystical place where my
And it was all very strange , and my heart was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started running in the room , and I felt like everything inside my body was simple .
And everything is very difficult and very thinkable .
There &apos;s no connection between my speed , and I think there &apos;s a home problem with my obsession with my inner system .
I &apos;m standing in my living room preparing to be underwater , and I &apos;m actually speaking inside my body .
I heard a voice that said , &quot; &quot; I have to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balancing , so I &apos;m going to write down the wall .
I slept and I looked at my hand , and I realized I could no longer repair my body .
I don &apos;t understand where I &apos;m going and where I &apos;m going , because my hand is held up by atoms and molecular walls and atoms and molecules .
If I was understanding something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that moment in my brain , everything is so quiet .
It &apos;s the same as someone who has recorded the TVs voice with Romo .
A nickname .
So before , I was amazed at what was going on inside my brain .
But then immediately , the energy that came into the platform at this large space station all around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt my sense of humility and strength .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
Then a blood vessel went to the left of my brain and he said to me , &quot; You are a lesbian . &quot;
We need to get some help , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seemed like I was really afraid of the problem , but I came back to the same consciousness that I called a long list .
But he was so beautiful .
Think about how beautiful it is that you &apos;re completely tied to this tiny brain that is pointing at you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this vessel where I work and I &apos;m trying to figure it out .
I felt so much in my body .
And look at all the relationships you have from the outside world and from that , some of the strengths were missing .
And I felt a sense of peace and quiet .
And guess what it would look like if you lost your back in 37 years from whatever emotional weight you &apos;ve been holding .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made a discovery . I made a discovery .
It was beautiful .
And then my brain got to the left side of my brain and he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , wait a minute .
We need some help , and I &apos;m thinking that I should be helpful , so I &apos;ve got to get out of the house and I &apos;ve gotten into the mechanical way , and now I &apos;m going to launch my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , can I get a car to work ? &quot; &quot; And this moment , my hand was completely crushed .
It was then that I realized , if my God is going to attack me , the next thing that my mind tells me is , how awesome !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
There will be some neuroscientists who are going to miss the chance that they &apos;ll be able to aware of their own brain and that they &apos;ll be able to go inside — ( Laughter ) and then one of the muscles came to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman — ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to relax . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t stop the fighting agency , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll return to my habit . Okay .
I have to call for help . I have to call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember the first job , and then I remembered that I had a business card that my phone number was on .
So I go into my studio and I open up three inches of cards .
And I look at the top card , while I can see it clearly in my eyes what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s not because it doesn &apos;t look like me in any particular point .
And the words would suffer from the map of paper and the map of the symbols , and I wasn &apos;t getting anything .
So I started waiting for what I call the illusion .
And at that point , the general step back from the truth , and I learned that this is not a card . This is not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this shot .
And in those 45 minutes , the effects of the pollution grew to the left .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I have no way .
So I take the phone and I apply it here .
I took a budget card , and I put it there , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the big boxes on the phone , and the big boxes come in .
But then I headed back to my own little brother when I came back , and he didn &apos;t remind me that I had a number that I didn &apos;t have .
So I held my fucking hand like a dagger and stood on the floor with my other hand clicking on these legs that when I came back to the normal truth , I could tell myself , &quot; &quot; Once I was in India , I finally got all the ones from all the India , and I heard the phone rings on my laptop , one of the men called me up and said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
And I say to her , &quot; I &apos;m so clearly talking to my brain , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And then I realized that I had no idea that I could speak a language and understand it until I tried it .
So he understood that I needed help and he supported me .
And shortly after that , another ambulance arrived at the Smithsonian , a hospital in Massachusetts .
I walked up and looked like a baby with a tiny stick .
Just like a poor kid in the air conditioning , and just out of poverty , I pulled the energy out , and I felt energized .
And it occurred to me that now I &apos;m not living my life .
Or the doctor saves me and gives me a second life , or a short transition .
By the time I left , it was shocking to me that I still lived .
When I realized I was diving into my soul , I gave life to God .
Now my brain was divided into two contradictions between reality .
The emotions started to come through my conscious system , which was only in the face of pain .
Lightning lit my brain like the sound of the forest , and the eyes were so low and dim that I wasn &apos;t able to hear a voice from the scene of the forest , and I was just scribbling the path of the uterus .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize the body &apos;s position in the blood , so I felt so big and so enormous and so enormous that I was free from my boss .
And my spirit was unleashed like a giant elephant standing in the ocean of dirty water .
Great Diane .
It has given me the quality of what it means .
And I remember thinking it would never be possible that I would discover my great sense of self in such a small body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I still live ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I am inspired .
And if I have been inspired by the neurons , and I still live , then whatever life is , I have been able to access the neurons , and I have seen this world filled with people with beauty and praise and kindness and love who know they can sometimes feel this quality .
And they can pick and choose the right books to move to the left side of their brain to search for transparent quality .
And then I realized how powerful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; It was a series of versions that taught me how to live my life .
And he inspired me to be healthy .
After the deaths of the aftermath of the prefrontal cortex , the soul shrunk the blood vessels from my brain that were involved in the sensitivity center of the brain .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the power of life , the power of life , with hand skills and two extremely good brains .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world where we are and what we want to be .
Where I can step in that moment on my right side of consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful cells are made up of molecular marriage cells , one that has all of them .
Or I can choose to step on the left side of my consciousness where I become an individual .
From quantum entanglement .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
The inside of me is us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And where ?
I think no matter how much time we spend our right brain fighting the nuclear power plant , we &apos;ll put peace in this world and our planet will be so safe .
And I thought that &apos;s what we need to embrace .
Thank you .

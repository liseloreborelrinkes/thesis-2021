Good morning !
Where are you people ?
They picked up my name , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the table in Arabic ?
No ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , as a young boy , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend and I was eating .
So I asked myself , do you have the Arab Spring ?
He looked at me strangely , and he thought he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( In English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In Arabic , for Muslim . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t understand what they say ? &quot; &quot; I understand . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! They call it &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Is the French word correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , let &apos;s solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Abed said .
He was speaking to me with three people , as he said to himself , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; mean in Arabic ?
A young boy made two words and placed a girl in exactly the same way .
How can he speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started thinking .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What is it that makes me feel empowered to speak my own country ?
Where could that be ?
How do we get there ?
Now when we are here , I am like so many people who end up in their lives , where they inherently leave everything that &apos;s inside them , just because they love it and they find it .
Should I be led to lead my culture , to lead my ideas , to mentors and spirits ?
Perhaps we have the most important battle savings in the children &apos;s stories .
Do they all want to send me what I learned in Arabic ?
To make them like this ?
What makes sense ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that kind of religious decision for what it was for me .
The Arabic doesn &apos;t ask the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , or the language of research , or the language that we use in universities , the language that we use everywhere in the workplace , the language that we explore when we work on a curriculum , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we exploit at the iPod .
If we do that , they blame our office .
So where can I exploit this ? We can all ask this question .
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But the second most important fact that we need to think about .
It &apos;s the Arabic mother language .
Research tells us that in other languages , we need to translate that into our own mother tongue .
In other languages , for creative appearance , the primary means of language .
How ?
Gabriel cell number , when he started writing , he used Arabic .
All of their ideas , imagination and philosophy were influenced by this little boy in this house where he grew up , felt a sense of happiness , heard a particular voice , and thought about a particular idea .
When they started writing in English , they had a lot of material .
Even when they wrote in English , when you learn their textbooks in English , you feel the same sense of happiness , they feel the same sense .
So you can imagine that these are also their teachers in English , this little girl who lives in the village outside of Lebanon .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Secondly , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to kill a nation .
It &apos;s a fact that emerging societies are occurring .
Germany , France , Germany and Chinese all of these things are happening .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it valuable .
That &apos;s why they use it in revenues , they spend a lot of money on spreading viruses .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developing world , this developing world that we don &apos;t yet have , and we want to move into this developing world .
They were the countries that were like us at a time , but decided to try to grow up , to research , and to go to those countries , such as brother-in-law , employee and so forth , to pursue their own language as teachers , to protect them .
They kept it close .
Because if you take Turkey and you make products and you don &apos;t write them on the ground , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be included in these shelters , unconscious officers , like we are more time .
So to create new inventions and new approaches , they needed to maintain their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Pain , selfishness , liberty , &quot; &quot; what will that remind you ?
What do you get ?
No matter who , how and how .
Languages are not just about talking , words alone are about us .
Language is a sign of a specific set of steps in our lives , and the words that are shaped by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Pain , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special saddle in your brain , and there are special feelings for a particular day in history .
Language is not the name of putting one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an internal idea that relates to our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our brain ?
How would you say you understood it or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , do you have lived through the period of the Freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , I &apos;m better off getting out and spending time talking .
It &apos;s that these impacts remind us of a particular thing .
My friend , a French speaker , who &apos;s a French speaker .
She was asking her already .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a night trying to improve and translate his wife , what it means to be &quot; &quot; crap . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Fifteen women got it wrong and they tried to understand it .
He wondered , how could one be so clear ?
Does she want to make herself ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand the word for his husband , because he couldn &apos;t understand , and he was right ; his thoughts were different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , he listens to me Fridays , and one night , I tried to translate for him to feel what I felt when I heard Fridays . &quot; &quot; A young woman tried to translate her , &quot; &quot; I raised her hand and why you painted it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I learned , because you &apos;re me , I grabbed your hand and I left you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Turn it on . Turn it on .
( Applause ) So what did we do for the Arabic language ?
We changed it into a mindset for society , and we started a vocabulary of Arabic language .
Although many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whatever the heat is over , move on . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language protector has earned a phrase , which is , &quot; I talk to you from the east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You say it in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do it because they didn &apos;t understand us .
And if anyone tells me , I am bitten by the Arabic language .
We say â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be confident in the way that our dreams , our dreams and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the way we think and what we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the east , but you &apos;re answering the West . &quot; &quot; The right sign is questioned .
Very easy , but very effective .
After that , we started another march with the landscape of letters on Earth .
You &apos;ve seen an example outside of it , a landscape in which the letters of black and white are sitting at the bottom of the table , with the text , &quot; Kill the language . &quot;
Why ? Don &apos;t actually kill your tongue .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill ourselves .
If we killed our language , we would have to have a knowledge .
We need to search for our existence .
We need to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s very easy to play the opportunity for new and faith .
After that , we appeared to be taking pictures of boys and girls in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; Coral &quot; &quot; photos of girls and boys .
We are very coal !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; No ! I used the word &quot; &quot; chocolate &quot; &quot; as it were . &quot; &quot; He wants to make a double check , but I &apos;m going to tell you the word that &apos;s best and the same thing .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not funny . We don &apos;t need to cure ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we &apos;re not going to allow anybody to grow up or understand that our language has authority on top of us , putting pressure on us , or shrinking our own patient and thinking .
Our idea is to create .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not refine the skeleton or anything , we can still be creative .
At this point , every single one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in the mother tongue .
Let &apos;s start today .
They write a novel or make a short film .
A single neuron can then be placed on a global level .
He can repeat the Arabic language on the front lines .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we need to know that , and we need to think that the solution is there , part of the solution .
In honor , what can you do today ?
Who &apos;s Twitter ?
For Judaism , I urge you , although my time is up , whether it &apos;s poverty , English , French or Chinese .
But the data , the Arabic script , doesn &apos;t write the Arabic script .
( Applause ) It &apos;s simple ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;re going to enter a virtual world with a language .
Getting back and forth is not easy .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do much more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk about each other .
We &apos;re here to enjoy the need for conservation in this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , spoke about her father &apos;s language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your father , ya . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say that , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , and I &apos;ve gone out of my daughter &apos;s light on the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I say , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say thank you
And don &apos;t expect anybody to hear it . ( Applause ) You get this culture of copyright . ( Applause )
I speak Latin English to say that it reminds us that our present situation is not an option but to the negative visions of my people whenever you see my generation not to be banked and told us that we are serious about this generation of inequality , not to reach our generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after

I love chocolate data .
In college , my primary attorney was a gardener , which meant I was writing a lot of magazines .
Now the average person when they write something , the approach will work .
You know ... ( Laughter ) Maybe you &apos;ll start your work less quickly , but the first week you do a lot of work , and then more work later , everything &apos;s done , because it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s my approach .
My response is all set , but actually the text function will start on the head , and then something like that happens .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with every text function .
And then there &apos;s this whole research paper on the pages , the text that you do in one year .
And I knew that my average approach to this was not an option .
It was a very big task .
I set up the plan , I decided that I would do something like this .
It &apos;s going to be something like this this this this year .
I &apos;m going to start small , in the middle months , jobs are going to increase , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it more like learning .
How hard is learning going to be ?
No big deal , right ?
And then a funny thing happened .
A few months ago ?
Go home , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we did a great project again .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then he would also lose weight , and I hadn &apos;t written anything , and we were a few .
And two weeks went by in a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went one day and I spent three days in David Lynn , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , I put 90 pages , two streets , and I didn &apos;t have to go on two streets â€” the front lines of people in the classroom , spending time in the classroom , and I left David Laun .
I thought , now it &apos;s all over .
A week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Tommy ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk about the paper of tomorrow . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Look , from today , it &apos;s the best .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t believe it . ( Laughter )
He was very welcome . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when you all thought , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very good .
Well , today I &apos;m blogging .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m blogging , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about lists .
My Ranger regularly puts six people to sleep , and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we are .
Now my hypothesis is is that the brain in the system makes a difference between six people .
To find out how I did a lesion where I could examine two brains like this one and diagnose one another , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not that great , but consider it .
So this is a sixth person in the brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
The decisions are made in both brains , but the brain is in the human brain that &apos;s playful .
Now what does that mean for a singer ?
It means , it &apos;s all good until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; Good time to commit work &#93; &#91; Yes ! &#93; The smart people will make a decision to make meaningful decisions , but they don &apos;t like this project , so they get charged , and they say , &quot; &quot; Look at the curtain top of the curve . &quot; &quot; Tennessee and Thona Hardering , because I know it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) So â€” ( Laughter ) And then we get to the bottom , and see , in 10 minutes , something new has gone up ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , which starts talking about the third or most of the talk about the TED Conference , and much later , it will end up watching the neutral mothers .
( Laughter ) It will take some time for all of those things , so there won &apos;t be any time for it to do today .
What a deal ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now , this is not the footprint you want to call .
It just wants to be in the present moment .
It seems to me that there is no mystery in the future , and it &apos;s only two things : compassion and passion .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all right .
If you know and you spend a lot of your life going further and happier , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to create , there is a generation of human animals .
Good to eat , good to think , and increase generation , that &apos;s probably what happened in the past .
But if you haven &apos;t been paying attention , the passenger &apos;s not that far off .
We &apos;re an increasing religion , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain , decision-makers , who can do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We &apos;re getting distracted .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And all we want to do is cure what we enjoy when it comes to joy .
Sometimes it seems as if they do what is easily and pleasurable , like eating , sleeping or experiencing an opportunity .
It &apos;s a shame for that .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate to do what &apos;s difficult , for a big purpose .
And this is the continent .
And for the rest of the world , this agreement always finishes the end , which spends more time in the bathroom , a simple and dense way that reasons outside the circle .
I call it a third place .
( Laughter ) The market is the place where the eastern people are best known .
That &apos;s where service comes when it doesn &apos;t have to be a leader .
In the third field that you &apos;re left with , in fact , is no longer true , because it &apos;s not true of space , space , fear , anxiety , and self-love â€” all the properties that are highly checked .
The question is , in this solution , when the source is sent , how do the system get into the balcony , which is less happy but important ?
It turns out that systems also have protected people , who are keeping them safe at three o &apos;clock in the morning â€” somebody said to him .
( Laughter ) Now this is a household mostly known , but when David Lawn is close , it becomes a great wonder , or then when people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that the building only works .
Now I had a relationship with it in my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and gave me the TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
My dream was a TEDster .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and my anger , something else in the brain that decides from rationality is going on .
He said , &quot; &quot; Did everybody understand anything ?
Do we know what happens one day in the future ?
We need to start working on it now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Here I am . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t Google get together and look at the Indian map at less than 20,000 feet , we &apos;ll just leave the house till we see India , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
Six months later , two months later , another month later , people at TED decided to name the Mermaid .
I picked up the Web , and it was my picture of me holding home .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) Household checks , and within seconds the system reveals itself to the soul . ( Laughter )
And remember being â€” he &apos;s afraid of the house â€” he &apos;s walking down the tree .
And finally , finally , long-term decision makers sent in and I can start talking .
Now , the homework assignment that tells you that every category has a cochlear implant , someone like me will give you two weeks , a couple of thousand weeks , and the beginning of the process cannot be heard , and then , amazingly , the unbelievable successful tool will be to go up and write the sentence .
And the three cleanliness is what we call the system of smart people .
That &apos;s great , but not links can be done .
And a few years ago , I decided to write a blog about it .
When I wrote this , it surprised me about the impact on this .
In fact , I received thousands of miles from all around the world and from people , who were responsible for various types of views .
They included narrators , bankers , engineers , penetrators , and high test scores .
( Laughter ) And almost everybody was telling the story and saying , &quot; I &apos;m still in touch . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the amount of emailing and email addressing .
They were lying in the textbooks of people who wrote how much check he spent in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , what happens next ?
Why are they all in the dark ?
Then there are two layers on the list .
So today , for example , I gave a talk about subjects , and they were all David Levine .
And when David is lying , the consequences of his affair are deadly because of the housing that he gets .
But the system is a different kind of a dependence upon a David Lane .
So if you want a project like this to start yourself like some arts or businesses â€” like some arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start paying attention to finding the speed , doing things .
In addition to doing so , there are so many things that David Lawn doesn &apos;t face , like getting in with his family , exercising , thinking about his health , thinking about his relationships , telling his relationship to the father who doesn &apos;t walk away .
Now , if the only way to go to Ssad is to get a job , it &apos;s difficult , because all of these data lines that are created are lost in the home .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest consequences are that you can &apos;t take them , they &apos;re always with your dad .
And it &apos;s a kind of typical metaphor that comes from very little to see and talks about less than just the usual suspects , the perennial raw materials .
You &apos;ve got the funny and the bad news .
And that can be the source of the destruction and the destruction .
So I thought , this is why they &apos;re emailing , and this is why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban teacher has observed them , sometimes in their lives .
The concern is not that they cannot ask their dreams , but that they cannot cooperate .
I learned all the emails and one thing emerged , and I think six people didn &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are .
Now , I may not be very complicated . Some of us â€” ( Applause ) â€” and maybe some of you in the audience have good relationships with Dan Lane , but remember when David Lawn wasn &apos;t there .
Now I want to leave you with one final thought .
I call it the Clinder of Life .
Each block represents a week , it &apos;s the ninth year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them have been hacked .
I think we all need to go out and get this .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in our work , because every life has never happened .
We need to be overwhelmed with compassion .
We all need it .
And we don &apos;t have that home , maybe we should start right now .
Probably not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
It &apos;s skin .
Thank you .
( Applause )
One day in the United States and Afghanistan , an eight-day Afghan refugee campaign in Afghanistan was staying away from an area in Afghanistan , helping to provide an office for the Afghan government to help provide an office for the Afghan government to help provide a government service to provide a protection for the Afghan administration so that they could provide a government service to provide the military service to provide
He came in at the height of an affair , and he lived around three , and he watched as a child by the time Captain Sevin was born , he watched as a child by the time Captain Sevin was born to save the gods and exclude the dead .
One of the people who knew her children , one of the orchestras and one of the Spanish students , was growing up on a helicopter , and one of the other kids was growing up on a helicopter .
So it &apos;s shown that Captain Seventine and his spirit are associated with this terrible geology of dying gas .
They brought them into the helium carpet and then you see the Cape Town where they &apos;re sitting and starting from before they allowed others to save .
I looked at this and asked myself , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are extraordinary emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love , and I knew why I work with people that they don &apos;t .
You know , they &apos;re giving you access to the glass , the people who want to experience themselves in order to benefit others .
In business , we blame people who are willing to vote for others in order to help us .
We have the elite calculus !
So I asked myself , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re hungry for the fire .
Those are the best people on the job description , the best people on the job description .
But this is completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s an environment , and if you &apos;re in the middle of nowhere , each of us has the ability to work together , then each of us has the ability to work together , and increase the ability to do that in others .
I have this great privilege of getting these people together and saying yesterday , &quot; &quot; Why can you do this ?
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing : &quot; Because they do it to me too . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that it &apos;s emotions not just of humans .
I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; Keep me alone . &quot; &quot; And you do .
It cannot be that I connect the two people , and they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this leave us ?
If you go back 50,000 years before the present , which is the beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is under threat , all of these rivers are very focused on us .
There &apos;s nothing personal about it .
Home resources can be shrinking in a long-term , long-term TEDster , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan , and it &apos;s all working together to reduce our lifespan .
And so we &apos;re ready in social animals where we come together and work together as part of what I call a charity , as in a neighborhood where we felt our personal connection .
And when we felt confident in ourselves , we were compassionate and cooperative .
It has continuous benefits .
It means that I can wake up at night and I can drive to see some of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t send each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t send you , it means you don &apos;t look at the dangers .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
The modern world is exactly the same .
This world is fueled by the dangers that are trying to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our opportunities of success .
It can make social progress so dramatically unreliable in the stock market .
It can be a new technology that you can download your business classes at night , and it can be a new technology that you can download your business classes at night .
Or it could be your opponent who sometimes tries to take care of you .
It sometimes tries to get you out of business , but at least it sucks up your brakes and tries to take your businesses away from you , it sucks up your brakes and tries to take your businesses away from you .
We have no authority on those authorities .
It &apos;s a permanent thing , and it will never end .
The only driver of change is conditions that are within an organization , and that &apos;s the place where the mathematical function is because it &apos;s the belief that governs the direction .
When a leader chooses to protect the people in her organization and their lives that are supposed to protect the people in her organization and protect the lives of the people in her organization , and that is to assess their peace and goodness results so that people are there and that they can experience their own heart and lower results so that people can feel safe and feel their own personal relationships so that they can understand things .
I was on a vacant journey , and I realized a fact that when a traveler tried to walk in front of him before he found it , and I saw the workers on the front door just as he passed the law as I was .
One of the first times I tried to walk on it â€” one of the first times I tried to walk on it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you cutting things like sticks ?
Why can &apos;t you walk around like us human beings ? &quot; &quot; And he gave me exactly the same answer .
They don &apos;t trust their leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Billion is not because they &apos;re keeping the Muslim world better .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up their leaders .
You see , if conditions are high , we spend our time and our strength keeping each other safe , we spend our time and our strength keeping each other safe , and therefore less organization .
What &apos;s a great leader for her is the most recent example of how to be a parent is a great leader for her , and the most recent example of how to be a parent .
If you think about how a good parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
We want to give our children opportunities , education , discipline and precision , when they need it , we want to give our children opportunities , education , structure and precision , when they need it , we want to give them the tools to grow and achieve more of what we can do to grow them and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
Well , that &apos;s exactly what the leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and precision , when they need it , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , structure and precision , when they need it , they want to give them the opportunity to create self-confidence , access and failure so that they can achieve more of the achievements that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more of the achievements that
Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the head of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who &apos;s the head of a technology company in New York City called Next Jump , who &apos;s the CEO of a technology company , is saying that if your family &apos;s hard time , will you ever let your child go ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? How can we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has had the practical lack of knowledge of customization ; Charlie has essentially lost the ability to invent life .
If you &apos;re a Next Jump employee , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of things like efficiency .
But if you &apos;ve got a problem , they &apos;re going to lead you and help you , just like we &apos;re going to do for a kid who comes home from school .
It &apos;s completely different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers who are sitting at CEOs , and that &apos;s why these men are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at CEOs , and that &apos;s why so many people are so angry and angry , some of the bankers are sitting at CEOs , who are unequally stressed and more courageous .
It &apos;s not about data .
But they have developed the fundamental principle of technology .
They &apos;ve grown a society .
We know that they &apos;ve given away their well-meaning babies to their own people , and we know that they &apos;ve given away their well-meaning babies to their own people , but rather that they &apos;ve tried to convince their well-meaning babies to their own people , rather than that they &apos;ve convinced their well-being to their own children .
That &apos;s what makes us , not data .
Can anyone imagine putting the wire around 150 million dollars ?
Why not give the teachers 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with that ? Absolutely not . Absolutely not .
The next leader will never give the data to the children .
The next leader will never give the data to the children .
But they will give people the skin exams of data for their children , but they will give people the skin exams for their children .
Baby Chepman is leaving a mining company in the Middle East called Barry Wehmile in 2008 , and they &apos;re leaving behind 30 percent of their traffic lights .
Now in a large miniaturization company , this is a very big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to maintain their enemies more often .
They needed 10 million dollars in babies , and today , you get together people like a lot of companies and you do a big job .
And Bob reacted that .
You see , the Baby Boomers don &apos;t trust the box .
But the Baby Boomers believe in cheating , and it &apos;s much more difficult to reduce heart valves and to reduce heart valves .
And then they built a dedicated program .
that every job , from the mainframe to the CEO , needs to be required for four weeks without permission .
They could never do it when they wanted it and they didn &apos;t have to do it .
But the way Baby published the program was very important .
He said it was better that we all took small doses of pain , that some of us would take much more money and make more pain .
So they have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel protected from the dignity of an organization , trust and cooperation is natural .
And just like nobody had expected , people started trading off each other .
What was more successful was business with less successful parents .
That is , something has gone through five volunteers to get one another through three volunteers .
Mathematics is an extreme , not a reward .
I know many people who are benefiting from the best institutions , and I know many people who are benefiting from the best institutions that are not the leaders at all .
They are compassionate attorneys , and we do what they say , because they have the authority on us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people who are in charge of organizations who don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re real leaders , and that &apos;s because they have the courage to see their left person , and that &apos;s because they have the courage to see their left person , and they have the courage to see their right person , and they have the courage to see their right person .
This is a leader .
I heard a story about some of the things that were going on out there in the theater , and as a way of science is that the fetus is eating in the honor and eating his people first and never saving anything .
And when he returned to the field , his customers gave him some of his food so that he could eat because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders .
We call them leaders because they take risks from one another , we call them leaders because they take risks from one another .
We call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can protect them , we call them leaders because they choose to be compassionate so that people can protect them and therefore give them the benefits , and when we do so , natural responsibility is that our people want to protect us .
They &apos;ll give us their own blood and oil and so they can see that their leadership &apos;s dream is a reality , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your blood and your blood to this person ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this for us . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the organization we all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we all love to work for ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we all love to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the story of a little girl named Mimpopo , who is also known as Limpopo and Mumalanga .
Where the water supply and the water supply is incredibly unfair as the mosque , and it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions , at the age of 17 , I was staying quiet with my friends in the bush .
The sun is getting warmer in summer .
And as I sat down in my pitch , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yesterday , why don &apos;t you just create something that you don &apos;t have to wear on your skin ? &quot; &quot; And I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I bought this stuff ? &quot; &quot; And I went home , and I did some research and I had some amazing data .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and only half are in South Africa .
Different diseases reside in this environment , which is the most dangerous tragedy known as trachoma .
The reason the Trachoma is so poisonous is because it &apos;s a reflex in the tragedy that you can be independent on .
This disease kills eight million people every year on a continuous basis , and the thing that &apos;s most important is that to keep your trachoma from drowning , you just have to give yourself a month : no soil , no vegetables , no English .
After looking at the data from Afghanistan , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it for myself , but I &apos;m doing it for less because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I went out to my brother &apos;s 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have an Internet broadcast broadcast broadcast broadcast
And I looked at this as a private issue of the box .
So Mahammad said it was right , our pheromone was ready .
Now we need to be in the process .
Four years later , with the phones on 40 pages full of businesses placed on my phone , I am the world &apos;s smallest patent holder and â€” ( &quot; &quot; now and not gold ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I can &apos;t say much more . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first glimpse .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to remember it .
( Laughter ) So after trying to influence it in high school and limited resources , which I had , the Middle East came in with a few new people , did it , and now we have a full-blown paradox , which is ready for the market , but now is in the market .
We learned some green boxes to commercialize DryBath and to people .
One of the things we learned was that the poor don &apos;t buy products in large numbers .
They &apos;re just buying under the need . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; they buy a ticket every day because it &apos;s more important .
So we put DryBath in these creative slices .
You put it between the two and the outside .
And the best thing is , a mere replacement of a goose is only five times .
After the invention of this model , we also learned a lot about manufacturing .
We also want DryBath , the average kid , to be here . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million pounds of water in the middle , whenever they leave and save two houses for children , which are in the middle of the inner city , two more homes for school , two more homes for school , two more homes for the children .
After seeing the global impacts , we &apos;ve taken away our key values , our cleanliness and our solving .
DryBath is the service of a poor man and a life of a poor man .
We &apos;re entering this process , now we &apos;re actually going into a world class to sell it to the retail market , and one question I want to ask you today for listening , on the Limpopo Circle , in a week , with a 50-linear ear ear analysis that doesn &apos;t need to be burned .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I learned a lot from this early work , last year Google announced me as the world &apos;s leading teenager .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest entrepreneur , the first African to have this accumulation , and one thing that amazes me is why I didn &apos;t want to be silent about it . Thank you .
( Applause )
In the West , I &apos;m showing you some of these results today , and I &apos;ve also been surprised by what are the actual reasons why organizations are successful â€” who are actually leading to the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are the best way to make the world a better place .
If you choose one group of people with the supply of equal waste and organize them in the beginning , you will find the human capabilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But if initial organizations are so good , why often failures ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what is the most important thing for success at first .
I wanted to learn so much about this , I wanted to learn so much about it , I wanted to embrace so many of my misconceptions and assumptions that came from some of the other organizations in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was starting at the age of 12 at a variety of different businesses that were coming out of the High School Business School and all the way to school when I was making solar power tools , then I was in college , when I was making radio .
When I got out of college , I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the beginning of the Library of India , in the last 20 years , we have held more than 100 companies founded so many successes , and so many great failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to put theories on those factors to say the greatest cause of business success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , I think .
I think everything is .
That &apos;s why I named my company Aideda Lib the old days that you feel about it .
Over time , I thought maybe the team , the ability to think about race or flow , are more important factors .
I never thought that this was going to be the President of the Mechanical Test , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone is a project wherever I don &apos;t get a mine . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team is important in capturing the ability to train machines on the side of the road .
Car is an eternal reality .
So I thought maybe the team is the most important one .
And then I started thinking about the business model .
Does an organization have a clear policy about income ?
With that in mind , it seemed to be the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Could that be the most important one ?
Of course , after that â€” is it the right time ?
Did it come very quickly , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s fast , is it you coming and teaching the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or is it too late , and is there a lot of damage before ?
So I found these five factors very respectful in many different organizations .
And the idea was to set up 100 Libya companies , and 100 of them outside to try and get a scientific result .
So first of all , these ideas for companies , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” these are all dollars of revenue .
And on the lower level , five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink â€” were hopeful for us , but not successful .
And then I tried to categorize all these characters as I think these companies had moved on to these islands .
Then in the outsiders of India , I looked at strange breakthroughs like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Here &apos;s a couple of failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
They were highly invested in new companies , and sometimes they were a business model , but they couldn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to learn that the worst effect of all of these companies was the success and failure , and the result struck me .
The first thing was choosing time .
Twenty-four percent of the time is spent on success and failure .
The team and the classroom are on another number , and then they think , being different , thinking differently , is really a third number .
But it &apos;s really not true , it &apos;s not that the thought doesn &apos;t matter , but when I looked at it , I was surprised that I didn &apos;t think it was the most important thing .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
The last two , the business model and investment , I understand .
I think the market model still gets worse , because you can start without a market model , and then when you grow more product customers , you include it .
And investment , if initially low investment , but now it &apos;s increasing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples here of all of these nodes .
Take the big success of Airbnb , which everybody knows .
It &apos;s very popular that many venture capitalists looked at this because people thought , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to be willing to put some of their houses into a grocery store ?
Of course , it was the wrong evidence .
One of the reasons why gross is so successful is because of the best market modeling , the best market thinking , and the best market thinking is the right time .
This company came before the financial challenge , when people needed additional support , and it certainly helped people respond to the proposition that they could give to their home .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber came in , the best company , the best business model , the best thinker .
But it was absolutely true of time to build the drivers they needed .
Dreaders also wanted additional supply ; it was very necessary .
Some successes , like Citysearch arrived at the time when people needed a toilet .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 , was when companies wanted more grandmothers to hear .
We thought it was great , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very excited about it . With a lot of colleagues and a great commercial examination , we had to work with great artists at Holland .
From 1999 to 2000 , the broad web was very little .
It was really hard to watch the online video , you know what to code in your browser , and eventually this company started in 2003 .
Only two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of code and found more than 50 percent in broadband America , YouTube got the best time .
Great , good time .
It turns out that YouTube , when it started , had no business model .
They didn &apos;t believe it would happen .
But he was the absolute best choice .
So to cut a long story short , perspective is really important .
I think it &apos;s very important .
But maybe time is really important .
And the best way to justify time is to see if there &apos;s really cooking for you to win .
And the real confidence is , the outcome is not innovative , because if something you like , you want to keep it in the future , but you have to work with lots of confidence over time .
As I said before , startups can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully , some of them are helpful at increasing your success , and then it won &apos;t be helpful in the other way .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the greatest data in history . &#93; &#91; Fifth access to clean and powerful people &#93; &#91; a sharp deal of money in non-zero-dollar companies &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We &apos;ve done the crossword puzzle of the Global Ventures to explain it . &#93; &#91; Five weeks ago the university center of the week was at the center
Which of those cases had been reported by secret weapons from small companies .
We know the inner stories of villages , banks and villages coming in with funeral forms , and they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , we need a housing company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see a text message , you can see the text message , you can see how they &apos;re doing it , how they &apos;re doing it .
The impacts are starting to show up .
The OECD government is very famous .
We also have the good news that perpetual detectors are the descendants of Alaska &apos;s descendants .
The revenue of the two billion dollars of revenue goes to the base of the Russian Empire by his child &apos;s friend , the famous Sistine .
And many prominent people will be infected , and those who are left behind will be reported by further hidden documents .
Now this sounds like a magic trick , or a violin story , or a violin story .
What do we do about it ?
But the fact that activists and power keep putting their money where they &apos;re going and how much they &apos;re not supposed to be taxed doesn &apos;t mean that effective improvements like learning to be healthy and educated .
And it affects all of us .
My organization for the Gulf Watts , this is amazing .
Global media and political leadership are talking about how people in shell companies manage their influences , what we &apos;re learning about from our gut .
I think it &apos;s a wonderful , wonderful world for people , and it &apos;s very hard to understand how these smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s sort of like Russian girls .
You can start a company with another company , a company with another company , almost impossible to figure out who is behind this thing .
It &apos;s hard to understand why it &apos;s so hard to understand what &apos;s happening to companies that are passing the law .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that we haven &apos;t heard much about it in America .
Perhaps it &apos;s not because of America &apos;s most famous class .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no smart people in America who don &apos;t invest in companies .
It &apos;s because of the way to ask companies , there are several American cities in Moscow .
I think if we study the findings of Kim Illinand or Dil Viewer or Mountain View or noble le le le , why the relationship comes from America .
But a lot of the American citizens don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give them less information to run through the library card .
In American schools , information like this is given to students .
Nine solar-electric investment is saving entrepreneurs from poverty .
This kind of thing affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Ventures , we wanted to look at how it came about .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was , we shipped a printing press to the 13 clean lines in Manhattan .
Our heritage as an African minister wanted to move to America , a home , a ship and a wage .
What was so striking about this was that all of the villages could give one of their own assumptions about how to move their teeth .
These were all early meetings , and we didn &apos;t make any money , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a money , but it was a disaster of the system .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not taken individually .
It &apos;s not about the individual voice that talked about our hidden assumptions and assumptions .
It &apos;s not just a censorship scientist who &apos;s found in Scandal .
It &apos;s a system that works , that protects television , pollution , dignity and impunity .
And in order to do that , we &apos;re going to change this game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of the game so that it can be hard to create things like this .
It can be incredible , that what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , that people are empowered and empowered .
But as a positive person , I think something will change .
Over the past few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company .
This issue was sold on a political issue , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Media stood in eight centimeters that happened in southern Finland in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is creating the central climate record , which is basically who is the country of Europe or is controlling them .
The evidence is that the E.U. is behind it .
The controversy in terms of legislation is the difference in the center and the Senate , whose development we wanted wasn &apos;t that high , so we were five .
They want to see the discoveries , the large companies , the large companies that were used to start in the world and in the U.K.
This is a change in the Gulf of Tunisia .
We need to reach out to the people who are lost to their knowledge behind barber companies . Business leaders .
You know , they speak up , they &apos;re not good for this kind of reasoning , we do .
Politicians need to address this issue , and they need to address the legislative change in information .
We can bring together the transparency of transparency , the secrets that are driven by the Tunisian intelligence agency and the school districts .
Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that Lickens , who invented you , have had so much sensation over the last few years that the rest of the world has had more media .
Can that be true ?
Julie Singer : Yeah , can it be true ?
This is an insight â€” what isn &apos;t it ? â€” that the average media in the world is showing you that a small group of factors are able to produce information that is more than all the media in the world .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do you get people to sign up ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julie Singer : There you go . I can tell you how â€” public service in the right way â€” and we have a lot of ways to get that information to us .
That &apos;s why we use a lot of highly valuable raw materials to shift materials from one place to the Internet , to clean the signs so that they can navigate with legal backgrounds like Sweden and Bill .
We get information in the form of information law , in the ordinary dictionaries , in Ross Switzerland or whatever , commodities organize it , forms it â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you talk about massive information for people , and then protect yourself against the illegal and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that the actual documents are real , but you really never know what the scale is .
Julian Sanging : That &apos;s right , where we &apos;ll always know how long it is , and if we get there at some point , we &apos;ll soon be able to collect that information .
( Phone clapping ) God forbid it .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I think these are the currents , and they &apos;re asking you what the code is for TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
This is something you described a few years ago .
If we can see it on top .
So that was Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you invented and then what happened ?
Julian Sanging : There it is .
This was a hidden magic report that the government of Kenya prepared after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government had been there for 18 years .
He was a nurse in Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the book â€” because of the authoritarian authorities who were trying to decide that China was going to spend 20 million pounds on this report , and so on .
And then the government was sitting on it and using it to counter its political will , which was the best person â€” still the most enlightened person in Kenya .
It &apos;s Jesus Christ .
That &apos;s why it was taken in 2007 , and we were able to achieve the success of the election before December 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after that new president , Kabul decided to volunteer with the person who he was horrified of , Daniel Araopi , so this report was handed over to the corner of the capital city .
Chris Anderson : And â€” so I mean , to cut a long story short , it &apos;s â€” it &apos;s just been played in Kenya , not by the clerks , but by the way , and by the way , it changed the outcome of your choice .
Julian Sanging : Yes . This is the headlines of Guardian and then the whole of Kenya , the whole of the world of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from the outside .
And he , after a few decades , believed that Kenyan people could talk about it .
And this blog was placed on a Chinese television 20 days , and it changed the equivalent of 10 percent of the vote according to a Chinese interview , and it changed the result of the election .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your intelligence has actually changed the world ?
Julian Sanging : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : There we go . We &apos;re showing a little bit of a clip of a windmill video .
This video is long , but here &apos;s a little clip .
This â€” I &apos;ll let you know , this is a video of heart failure .
RD : Happy birthday to them , when you first met them , you gave them two .
I found , oh , there are four with them .
The path is clear . It &apos;s okay . Gold &apos;s going .
When they &apos;re sitting in front of you , tell me â€” go away .
They &apos;re all dollars .
Glass , glue !
( Machine noises ) Gold Rush . Gold Rush . ( Machine noises ) Gold Rush .
Hatel â€” two engines , two engines .
We should move now , time is up !
Okay , we killed eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two old Dutch carpeters , and we &apos;re still running the vegetables .
Roger . They &apos;re on my behalf .
Two , this is two , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , what a deal . What happened ?
God forbid you , Jesus Christ . Yes , I forbid them .
CA : So what did that do ?
Julian Sanging : People who worked on it had a huge impact on it .
We finally got two people elected to do more research on it .
These were the first three times that happened .
CA : So there were 11 people on this issue , right ?
Julian Sanging : Yes ! Two rollers , two small children .
Generally 18 to 26 people died .
CA : And after his performance , there was a lot of anger .
What was the underlying reason for regret , you think ?
Julian Sanging : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves as the ultimate inequality of power .
On the one hand , some people go to the village , and then a kilometer away , the villagers start digging their village , 30 miles away , and the villagers start digging their children .
There were two journalists who weren &apos;t otherwise aware of their work .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadmining got arrested , and he said that he had acknowledged that video had made 280,000 U.S. public records as well .
Did that really happen ?
Julie Singer : So what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve accepted the document .
Five days ago , it appeared that 150,000 documents were made and 50 .
But what we &apos;ve done now is we &apos;ve given Rwanda and an American safety house in the beginning of the year , but it doesn &apos;t have any relationship .
I mean , I often came to this safe house .
Chris Anderson : I mean , if you gave thousands of accessories to the American safety house ...
Julian Sanges : We &apos;re going to give them what we &apos;re going to do . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do ? ) Julian Sangu : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sanges : Because these kinds of things show that actually , right now , what are the Arab states , the real violation of human rights in these governments ?
If you look at the hidden documents , the material is in them .
CA : Just play around with it .
I mean , normally what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is that correct ?
Julian Singer : So the question is , what information is important in the world , what information can &apos;t be acquired .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s the information that companies spend money on storing money , and it &apos;s a great sign that when they want to get information out , they have a chance to do something good , because what they know better , and they know their stories , they also care about how to do it .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of science .
CA : But are there any risks to this , individually or collectively , where there &apos;s an unexpected way to think about it ?
Julian Sanging : We didn &apos;t do the same thing with them .
I mean , our grand challenge is practical .
With information , we &apos;re able to gather in a very specific way the information that &apos;s private â€” the information that &apos;s available to somebody else .
But there are also some mysteries â€” like your doctor has your information ; there &apos;s a mysterious secret â€” but we &apos;re talking about the civil services that come and join us .
CA : OK , so they &apos;re doing this with emotion .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it is , for example , you think , someone whose daughter , whose daughter is in the American file , and they say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people like to count on other people .
There &apos;s an American philosophy of the dead .
Which has impacted â€” but it has given millions of people around the world that the U.S. political wonder is .
Although they &apos;re not my daughter , who are you going to say ? What are you going to say ?
Julian Sanging : Here &apos;s how we get asked so many questions .
But remember in the Arab region , in Iraq , in Afghanistan â€” you don &apos;t need to watch the video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference in their feelings , it doesn &apos;t make any difference in their perception .
Because they all look at something every day .
It &apos;s going to change their minds and their minds that give them money , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re looking at hope in terms of what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous if you wanted to illuminate this light , you needed to maintain a sense of self-worth ?
Julie Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we &apos;re not a different species .
We don &apos;t have the same intellect as the other intellect .
If they do , it will be a very difficult situation for us to do that , but what we do is we make people moral enough that they feel more compassionate about how they do it .
Chris Anderson : I think , we &apos;ve done the best we can â€” we &apos;ve brought the strangers here .
You can also imagine that there will be different kinds of stories about joy and joy .
One is the hero of hope .
Or the problem .
What &apos;s the view of the hero ?
And what about the problem ?
Julian Sanging : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : That &apos;s a great number of people , really good .
We &apos;re going to have to try and â€” now they &apos;re going to show another example .
Here &apos;s something you didn &apos;t know before , but I think you did for TED .
Here &apos;s a very interesting story , which is old , right ?
What is that ?
Julie Singer : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
Last year â€” in November , a lot of important Russians were put in bananas , as in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we had the Report Mile â€” which was a very nice experiment about it â€” where I was told that in fact , they were competing against different conservation companies , they were kicking in there and they were kicking in .
And there were some banana governments and things like that .
And there was nothing above this report . That was a very difficult thing for us to do .
We couldn &apos;t believe her because she didn &apos;t know who she wrote and what it was about .
That &apos;s why we wondered , perhaps , that some company did this in a competitive game .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t really know , but what can we do ?
This material is so good , and it seems right to watch , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the same week that he wrote it , and he wanted to write the scale . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Look , we want to write the scale . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to talk about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show that you &apos;re legally owned by this ?
Is that who you really are ? &quot; &quot; And so they brought us what we think of as Scriptures with the name of text , the microphone world .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened a lot .
It &apos;s our way of understanding and predicting what the material is , and trying to write letters to people .
CA : All right . So , any information from inside the BBC ?
Julian Sanging : Yeah , we &apos;ve got a lot of stuff , I mean , at this point , we &apos;re collecting a bunch of stuff and refining stuff , like hard stuff .
This is why our honor of publishing has become so successful in a few months , because we are improving our bucket system because of the rare public waste that we have .
This is the source .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s playing , most of our capacity is dominated by our growth , and that means that we have a lot of public services in our hands , but we don &apos;t have that many people who can modify and imagine .
CA : So that &apos;s the real issue , essentially , how many presidential advisers or journalists feel ?
Julie Singer : Yes . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that &apos;s really hard to solve quickly , because with the material that &apos;s within us , we need to innovate so that we can bring people together that have a lot of sense of what conservation is doing , and then less sense of business .
CA : All right , so you &apos;re telling us a little bit about your own self and how you got to the job .
And I think where I learned you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanging : Yes , my parents were in the movies business and then moving away from the north , so it was the effect of both of these things .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : I mean a psychologist , so it &apos;s just saying that all things together can produce artificial differences .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were just one at a young age , and you got into the workshop very quickly .
Julian Sanging : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist working since I was very young .
I wrote a letter to myself , and I was at that time the girl had passed me through this crime .
That &apos;s why you should take the word and appreciate it .
I mean â€” there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian mammals that are using your grandmother &apos;s bank account .
That &apos;s why the word is now not as good as the word before .
CA : Yeah , well , I don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what do you think your core value is ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps some event in your life that helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in the facts .
But the basic value : well , good , hard people don &apos;t generate affectionate ; they grow their own .
And that &apos;s the green that I &apos;ve learned from my father and some other brave and hard people who live in my life .
Chris Anderson : Can &apos;t brilliant and heavy people not generate the immune system ?
Julian Sanges : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a young man , so I &apos;m not very good at breeding , but somehow â€” there &apos;s another way â€” the production of mammals , which is approaching the police .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
Chris Anderson : So , just in the last few moments , just this : What happened in the last year ?
Basically you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve got a banking problem , and then you &apos;ve got the newspaper there , and then you &apos;ve got the story burst out of it .
Instead , they inspired your position .
You &apos;ve been very famous in the West Bank . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yeah , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
The E.U. is a crisis .
There it was .
The bank had grown to 10 times the size of the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that in July after the year of reporting .
And the state of the campaign had passed since it was published five minutes ago , as a movie : &quot; The state of the campaign against the Nazis , and the state of the Netizens was , &quot; This has never happened to us before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spending all this time , and we became very famous in the West Bank , I went to the Ice Land and talked about it .
And there were these elements of people who didn &apos;t want to be again , and as a result , the Seventh Landers , some of the other international miners , we submitted a kind of an Asian Land law as a kind of freedom media , as a result of the world &apos;s greatest protection site , the New Apple press for free .
A country like Ice Land is like the nation , which is coming up from the bottom up .
And just a month ago , the Australian Parliament sank it .
Chris Anderson : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look into the future , do you realize that the more expected the emergence of power and power , greater security , or are we going to see greater power , or is it going to lead to this ?
Julie Singer : I can &apos;t believe where the situation is going .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to be made to match the law of liberty and the law of transparency in the world â€” in Europe , in China and in the U.S.
What is it going to be like ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very exciting time to live â€” because with a little effort , we can move on one side or the other .
CA : All right , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience &apos;s rabbit into what they call , the judges , the honor , and all the power .
Julie Sung : Thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was totally obsessed with food .
I don &apos;t like playing and watching .
So I did that , which is the heart rate .
I &apos;d been following my childhood Connecticut records and watching these videos contract .
When I grew up in college and came home in the early 1990s , I got this call .
My team broke .
And when I looked at it from a local perspective , I thought , how does the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to some low-lying mountains where I found the snow , the North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or the Indus Valley , repeatedly prosecuted four species on the grasslands â€” nice , thin , silence and code .
And I thought this was very peculiar , and I was surprised to see if anyone else had this intense brand .
And when I got into it , I realized people weren &apos;t watching their career team .
Ordinary people see something like this .
To confine the natural world to a few elements , there is no unusual human character .
This is something that we did 10,000 years ago when we analyzed our ancestors .
If you look at the oil spill 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s pretty sharp and thin , you &apos;ll see all kinds of creatures like this .
But if you look back 2,000 years , you &apos;ll see just four animals : salt , cow , chicken and chicken .
It &apos;s also true of ancestors .
If you look at the mines of New York City about 150 or 200 years ago , you would see cartoons , sticks and floods .
But if you look at the remoteness of the existing distance , you &apos;re only going to be four orders of magnesium , toothpaste , but also toothpaste .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shaheen .
This is a brand new problem .
In the last 50 years we &apos;ve been doing exactly the same thing .
The second great battle left us with an amazing enthusiasm to be alive .
During the Cold War , we developed technologies such as smoking , polymer , etc . , and the dawn of all this stuff .
And since the end of the Second World War , I &apos;ve come to see the tremendous increase in the capacity for months .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that fish farm and sea urchins have increased , and within two years , their income has increased from overall weight .
Now if you collect fertilizer and forest volcanoes , it will be equivalent to two Chinese volcanoes every year .
My favorite example of using Chinese cochlear is not one , because China is not just one of the largest nations , but the largest nation .
Let &apos;s now turn to our square legs .
The first is the largest use of salt in the U.S. and the West .
Gold Rush is an extraordinary resource .
Just one pound of jellyfish will take five , 10 , or 15 pounds of food to get to market .
Logging to the marketplace is an unbelievable definition .
In a study done in a clinical study in Delhi University , it showed that methods like household water are extremely ineffective for insulin .
But here &apos;s the problem .
That whose battlefield is banned , they are the battlefield of Mongolia .
Now look at these cute little girls .
They keep the Earth &apos;s footprint from its place , protecting the beaches , keeping the beaches and giving birth to all kinds of important things for the environment .
A lot of this has happened with the civil war in Minnesota .
We have spent the last 30 or 40 years alone eating millions of coastal plants .
Another action that &apos;s going on here is what the philosopher Marc Benjamin calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve seen it on the treadmill before you see it , and it &apos;s very controversial .
Today there are quite a few reasons that the small aggregates hidden away from the late , but with it it , a large number of other males are able to infect and change from their late food .
And a lot of times , they &apos;re working on the places that are named after the Red Brigades , and it &apos;s the kind of thing that we like to look at on the river , which means that the environmental system is eating itself and making it cool .
Then there &apos;s another big food in the U.S. and the West .
Titan is equally global .
The way to organize this structure is to look at large areas of the world .
We also have our own area where scientists call the Environmental Management Archive , or ICCAT â€” the International Committee of Defense Protection .
Carl Shepherd put together a great adventure for all of this technology .
We can take tuna and make it , but it &apos;s not good for tuna .
Many people don &apos;t know , but tuna keeps blood .
It absorbs over 40 miles per gallon and can heat up to 20 degrees above its environment .
All the waste products on the retreat end almost entirely .
Break the pump , the blood flows into the pump , which doesn &apos;t slow down .
It &apos;s good for protons .
But the forest creature is 40 miles away from home , and it &apos;s not capable of staying in the form .
The weather has been good , it doesn &apos;t have to be bad for the weather .
This is my political connectome .
Connecticut laid down the forest floor .
If you look at the map of the connectome , every single dot has to be mapped .
Connecticut policies are more than 3,000 .
So I &apos;m saying that more people in the connectome â€” ( Laughter ) â€” if anyone has opened the connectome , I think we can dramatically improve the world .
And all over the place , these are the rockets that propel the kids to go to the mosque .
As a result , we have a success story on the pyramid and on the temporal lobe .
When the space shuttle began , there were six pounds of forest floor to create a foundation for Sami .
But now it &apos;s getting a lot better .
Instead , there &apos;s one thing that comes with this little bit of false water , because if you look at the footprint of the Freudian , they name the footprint of a footprint .
Whereas the pie checks it out .
It &apos;s hard to say things like chess pellets and craftsmanship .
But then again , the credit card industry requires that it creates the replacement of the FDA .
This is a system that is producing cooking , and it &apos;s being produced by geysers .
It &apos;s been declining for seven percent of the year .
Even though we spend a lot of money getting into the market , we &apos;re still spending a lot of money .
We don &apos;t just eat milk ; we eat milk and eggs .
We &apos;ve got what &apos;s eating grasses and what &apos;s eating .
Because on top of it , the blood and hands and so forth add bullets .
I wonder what the hell she has , but she has also opened the door .
India is the first or the first one . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of forest creatures that are being taken out of the sea .
That &apos;s the third part of China , or the number of people in the United States who get out of the sea every year .
The last thing is in four .
Philosynthesis really began as a lifetime .
And it began to look like the owner of a local financial industry noticed that the next day it would never be on the table .
He grabbed hold of the rock and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
What the syndrome would be worth caring about for the Swinter was a evidence that even though it wasn &apos;t worth caring about .
So he made his own lifetime scenario .
Unfortunately , it came in at 30 cents .
He wanted to make a 25-centimeter probe , so he set up the Titan code .
This is produced by Paul Sandwich , who is the largest mass-industrial art industry in America , discovering two to three billion pounds of dirty water every year .
If we stop polluting the policies , perhaps Tehran .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had no idea .
It changes the plasma protons in the animal protein in a very dramatic way , and that &apos;s me for the third world .
In fact , it &apos;s a very sustainable solution that &apos;s grown from one individual in nine months .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a dirty vegetable .
It doesn &apos;t include the API and DNA that we think will keep us alive all the time .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
That &apos;s about three million tons in size .
One possibility that conservation policies have enabled us to eat it ?
Can we get this straight ?
There are reasons for it .
They have a wonderful childhood in the marketplace , where the average elite is at the top of the Indian economy .
This is on average three , EPA and DIY .
So this is her ability .
But can we take this path and instead of giving away a few dollars &apos; pay or a few pay notes and convert it into a Facebook page , we can lower the bar and clean up the middle aggregate for two dollars ?
The other country , which is also very interesting , is home-specific .
There are many more EPAs and DDIY .
The Indus calculus has a profound effect .
Indonesia &apos;s revenues are only three-quarters of the country &apos;s revenues .
Actually , it comes out of about three walls .
The atmospheric universe is three times the size of the atmosphere , so it just collects .
If you look at the world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our bluefin greenhouse , we have been eaten by the use of Facebook and neutrography .
Over the next 20 years , more than 400 deaths have been produced , which is a very big killer of the oceans .
As you might think about the clip , there are more than three protons , and more than three , these are very effective things .
This is exactly the same as true .
And last fall is a question mark .
We can make a mess that can help us build smart protons .
These creatures should be green , increasing and changing their environment , and they should be keeping the environment green and changing as quickly as possible , and they would like to be EPA , DHA , OMG3 and Facebook .
It &apos;s still in the papers .
I &apos;ve been reporting these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I talk about it , nothing says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do it all . We can do it .
But try to do it .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third largest percentage of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the oceans .
I mean , this is all being done .
We want to understand without our needs .
But if we do something about it , it &apos;s going to be a big deal .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was born to expand the brain because I have a brother who is affected by mental illness .
More and more , I wanted to understand as a scientist how I can connect my dreams to my reality and make my dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they do is they disconnect their desires from a common reality and they act on it .
So I stopped looking for intense mental illness in my life .
And I moved to Boston from my office in India , where I was working at the Prime Minister of Financial Bank , which was in the psyche of Harvard University .
So what are the differences in people &apos;s brains that generally seek answers to differentiate from people &apos;s brains that usually occur versus people &apos;s brains that are damaged by Schizophesiology or BBC ? So what we &apos;re really trying to do is build a microbial map of the brain , whose cells are messing with the chemistry , and how much they &apos;re doing ?
So there was a lot of courage in my life because I was doing this research on the day , but maybe four weeks later , I was on my way to Newcastle Airways on a pilgrimage of NAMI .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I found myself confronted by an intellectual endeavor .
On the left side of my brain was a nine strokes .
And in the next four hours , I watched my brain completely disappear from any ability to understand information .
By the morning of college , learning how to read and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve created a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is the upper part of the brain that touches the lower part of the brain , and it &apos;s going to keep in mind .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
Those of you who think that computers , on the right side of our brain , work like a parallel processor , where the left side of our brain works like a solar processor .
These two parts also translate messages from one another through the crossword puzzle , which is a collection of about 300 government offices .
But there are two sides of it .
Because they think of information in a different way , each part has a completely different understanding of the information , their facial appearances are in different things , and you let me let you know who their personalities are in different ways .
The deal will come . Thank you very much .
Interviewer : Yes , there &apos;s a lot more coming .
( Laughter ) The evidence we have in our brains right now and for that moment .
Right now , part of our brain is thinking about images that are organ thinking about the movements of our body .
Information is stored in the form of energy , and it is stored in our bodies by the flow of our whole nervous system , and then it is restored in the form of a magnificent Islamic class that we see in the present moment , what it is like to feel and what it is in the mind .
I &apos;m an energy geared away from the energy of my surroundings by the right brain .
We are the energy systems that are coming from each other through the right-hand side of the brain as a human family .
And at this point , we are bringing in large numbers of the planet who are contributing to improving the world .
And at this point , we are the best and the best .
The left side of our brain is a completely different place .
Our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
Our left brain is about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is such that we are now beginning to collect the largest aluminum / clay and begin to collect analyses from it and then assemble analyses from it .
And it also reinforces this amount of information that is organized and distributed across all of these things that we &apos;ve learned in the past , and the possibilities of the future , namely , our designs .
The way we think about the left brain is in language .
This is a conversation that is taking us and our inner world from the outside world .
It &apos;s the little voice that tells me how to go home and buy it .
I need them in the morning . It &apos;s the sense of pursuing my computing book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going .
But perhaps the most important voice is what it says ! I am !
And as my brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become a separate faith .
I become the only person in the world to get rid of the energy that surrounds you and the fire .
And part of my brain was dead this morning in the aftermath of Philadelphia .
On the morning of the collision , my left eye slammed into a slam of pain .
It was as painful as it was from the eye of an eye .
And that pain just dragged me and left .
And then he stopped and left .
It was extraordinary to me that I had never experienced any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No way , I &apos;m not going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I walked around and I put my card billboard on the front of my body .
Now I &apos;m sitting in front of this machine , and it feels like I &apos;m standing in front of an early man who &apos;s circumcised Dan .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I sit down and I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , I think this is the most bizarre and poor thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the way my consciousness has changed , which is the general sense of being a human being in the machine , but now I &apos;m in the hidden place where my consciousness has experienced itself
And it was all strange and poor , and my brain was growing .
So I got out of the machine , and I started screaming in the room , and I felt like everything inside my body was trapped .
And whimsy matters a lot .
There &apos;s no connection in my speed , and I think there &apos;s a household problem , so I &apos;m just focused on the inner system .
I &apos;m growing up in my own underwater house , and I &apos;m really speaking inside my body .
I heard a voice that said , &quot; &quot; My daughter has to play you now .
My foot goes down , and then I &apos;m not balanced , and I roll up and down the wall .
I &apos;m sitting there watching my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t rectify my body &apos;s thoughts .
I can &apos;t understand where I &apos;m starting and where I &apos;m going , because my hand and my hand were held together by atoms and Michael &apos;s wall .
If I understood anything , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment , the conversation on the left side of my brain got completely silent .
It &apos;s like someone was speaking the TVs on a remote control .
A silver lining .
First , I had a surprise in the wiring of my brain .
But then immediately , as I did in another platform , I came across this great space jacket that was around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt my great faith and strength .
I felt a part of that energy that was very beautiful .
Then a bone died on the left side of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; You &apos;re damaged . &quot;
We need to help them , and I said to myself , I &apos;m really afraid of any issue . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really afraid of the issue here , but I &apos;ve come back to the same consciousness that I &apos;m calling for a lot of money .
But he was such a beautiful place .
Think of it as a beautiful place where you &apos;re completely connected with this tiny brain that &apos;s close to you from the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my wrist and I get really depressed about it .
I felt a lot of joy in my body .
And consider all of your relationships from the outside world , and some of them have been lost .
And I felt a sense of peace .
And consider what it would look like to be removed from that 70-year-old emotional weight that you lived in .
( Laughter ) Oh , I sort of started as a cult .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain started to leave , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow !
We need some help , and I think I need to help myself , and I need to help my nerd , so I &apos;ve come out of the closet house and I &apos;ve gotten myself into the machine shop now , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Can I drive ? &quot; &quot; And this moment , my mouth has become completely fuzzy .
It occurred to me at the time that my God was attacking me with a golf cart , the first thing my mind tells me is how great it is !
( Laughter ) How amazing !
Some brain researchers will come to realize this opportunity that they can recognize their own brain , and they will come from inside â€” ( Laughter ) â€” and then one minute come to my brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have the time to waste . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; All right , I can &apos;t get rid of the golf cart , but in a couple of weeks I &apos;ll get back to my normal range . All right .
I need to get a call to help . I need to get a call . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my job , and then I remembered that I had my business card on my phone number .
So I go into my studio and I create a three-dimensional motto card .
And I look at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eyes what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you that this card is not because I &apos;m not aware of any particular points .
And the words on paper were held together by maps and symbols , and I wasn &apos;t learning anything .
And then I started waiting for what I call the description .
And at that point , the general was repeated again , and I learned that this wasn &apos;t a card , this wasn &apos;t a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to download this bullet .
And during that period of 45 minutes , the effects on the left of the file were increasing .
I don &apos;t understand the number , I don &apos;t understand the telephone , but I don &apos;t have a way .
So I put on the phone and I put it there .
I took a jewelry card and I put it there , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the jewel beetle on the phone as the jewel beetle .
But then I send myself to the other side of the lake when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember I had that number .
So I grabbed hold of my college girl &apos;s hand like a doll and stood on the Hindus and pretended that when I came back to the normal truth , I could tell you that I had been here before , and I finally got all the way from India and I heard that the phone rang up on my wrist , one of my girls called up and said , &quot; &quot; Wow Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And
So I say to her in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m talking myself , I need help . &quot;
And from my voice , something like &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like a Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; And he left me with what I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak a language , and I couldn &apos;t understand until I tried to speak .
So he understood that I needed help and he helped .
And shortly afterwards , in one of Ambulances , Sierra Leone was visiting the hospital from one of the other facilities .
I walked around like a toddler .
Just like the one story where the weather stayed and the weight stayed out of the closet , I pulled the energy out and felt the weather staying in .
And it occurred to me at that moment that I &apos;m not licensed for my life .
Or the doctor would save me and give me a second life or a second time of travel .
By the time I left , I was surprised that I still lived .
When I felt the sense of my spirit , I said goodbye to life .
Now my brain was capable of two different facts .
It was at that time that my emotional system started to develop emotions that were only experienced in pain .
The light was shining my brain like the fire of the forest , and the lights were so close and so strong that I could not understand a voice , or I could not hear a voice , and I was just scribbling the path .
Because I couldn &apos;t understand my body &apos;s question , so I felt so much bigger and broader as someone who had been free from my bowl .
And my spirit was unleashed , like a great joke in the middle of nowhere .
The Great Divergence .
I had the quality that matters .
And I remember thinking that it would never be possible that I could find my greatest knowledge of being able to learn inside of the small bodies .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;m welcomed .
And if I &apos;m brought in neurons , and I &apos;m still alive , then whatever life is that can be achieved by neurons , and I &apos;ve seen a world that has been married by beautiful , fragile , compassionate and loving people who know that they can ever feel that quality .
And they can choose to live and choose , and the right thing is , wherever they want to take their books off the left side of their brain , they want to take their steps and search for that particular quality .
And then I realized how wonderful this experiment could be . &quot; &quot; What a turnaround that taught me to maintain my life .
And he gave me the opportunity to be healthy .
After a half-hour stroke , the dead blood flow from my brain was trapped in the same blood flow as the brain &apos;s poor performance center .
Here I am with my mother , who is a real photographer in my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we ?
We are the hallmarks of quantum life .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in the world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step on the right side of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful cell types are implanted in a shape , all of which exist .
Or I can choose to step to the left side of my consciousness where I become an individual , &quot; in a tiny , tiny way .
Water splashes .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My interior is us .
What would you choose ?
What do you choose ?
And who ?
I think every time we spend our left-hand cord electricity on the right brain , we will be able to free the world peace , and our planet will be so safe .
And I thought , you know , we need to figure this out .
Thank you .

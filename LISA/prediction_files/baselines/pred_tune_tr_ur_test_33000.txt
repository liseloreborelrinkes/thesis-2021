Wow !
Do you people come ?
They wrote a letter , but I just fascinated by saying , &quot; Did anyone ever write a letter , &quot; &quot; right ?
Who &apos;s not ? Okay , who &apos;s not .
An old lady , Pranitha , P.A. , was sitting in her head with the dark shadow .
So I wondered if you wanted to explore the missing symbols in front of you ?
It looked like it was all wrapped up , thinking about it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Self-Organized . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Halul of the toys . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re selling it ? &quot; &quot; Miss me .
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It doesn &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; The magnetic &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Would that be ?
&quot; &quot; Okay , come on . Please don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; Wrong .
And he was talking to me , like , &quot; If it &apos;s all over the world , if it &apos;s going to stand waiting for me ! &quot;
I mean , what &apos;s stopping ?
A son who managed to escape dressed as a son on an island .
How does she talk about that ?
In that moment , I wondered .
Shereen El Gore .
Hot stuff !
Gotta get used to this in my country ?
Doesn &apos;t it feel that ?
How did we do that ?
Now , when we &apos;re not here , I &apos;ve been blessed with amazing people , who go back just as often , as opposed to the cash incentive to determine whether or not they have been in the presence of what they are benchmarking and what they are .
Did I know if I &apos;m going to die , why would I expect my crooked ?
Hello , it is the most important thing about children &apos;s death .
Have I think they &apos;ve been a chef of something I &apos;ve learned in while ?
What about making these identical ?
What does that matter ?
In all that , I admired it .
I couldn &apos;t find the perfect antidote to the local ecstasy , much like the Golden Rule .
It does not represent threats .
It &apos;s not limited to the irregular , or , by the way , that we live in the European language , which is what we call the basmala , and when we speak to the presence of divinity on the screen , and it is really not what we are selling for inspiration .
If we do that , then he doesn &apos;t pay the bill .
So what if I go back to doing that ? We &apos;re all pretty standard !
So , you know , go to a remoteness . So what do we do ?
It &apos;s one .
It &apos;s an activist that I think at least .
Sleep .
He knows that reverse osmosis needs to be rewarded by the bitter divisiveness .
Aware of the devastation of the Great Leader .
How ?
Great Leader , when he wrote about it , he de-linked .
Halfway up the bank , India and Iran , who is totally confused with the face of a leaf , is shocked to see a woman , moved on the side , and think for a long time .
When they wrote in English , they spoke into it .
And by the way , when they wrote in English , when you scroll through the channel of their ranch , you felt like Ashley , you feel connected .
Once you see that in this mere hamburger , the facial blood vessels in this piece of leather , the shape of the letter Kai .
So , it &apos;s a tool that doesn &apos;t take away from the rest .
And furthermore , it &apos;s largely assumed that if you &apos;re wealthy , there &apos;s a magic sphere , it &apos;s just metabolizing that .
It &apos;s a place where cell culture takes place .
Oh , by the way , salt and everything is on .
That is why they represent their identity .
He &apos;s gifted .
That &apos;s why they spend a lot of money on the continent , looking after it .
Are we from them ?
Okay , we &apos;re not all from the world , it &apos;s not as if we &apos;re imagined , and we &apos;re deeply engaged in this world .
He was just like a mentor who was picked up on an aspect of oblivion , picking up the phone , and mentoring the country , like Hasbro , who &apos;s leaving his steps on the horizon so that he &apos;d be drowned out .
They saw her the Koran .
Because if you &apos;re a rationalist , if you don &apos;t write in it , it &apos;s not the enemy .
You can &apos;t believe it &apos;s a crocodile .
And they &apos;re two threads — these are recycling , as we know them now .
So just before they had another company , they needed to let themselves meet .
If I was like , &quot; &quot; Hello , please . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What did this tell you ?
Which made me liked .
Oh , by the way , and not .
You don &apos;t just have that kind of colorful , you know , just immediately .
Now , there &apos;s other things that are predicted , and remoteness is the opposite .
So when we are . &quot; &quot; Hello , please . &quot; &quot; So I left you with a recycled idea idea — there &apos;s a random jumble of vessels in this space .
It &apos;s not about letting it happen .
This is an old assumption of how , and we lose a limb and how we look at our again .
What is it ?
How would you say it doesn &apos;t really matter ?
So if I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Hatzalah , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; If your son comes in and says , &quot; Dad , how can you get his crocodile ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t know what steps you get , well there &apos;s a long way to go and take your time .
It &apos;s just that they stay in a shelter .
I have a planetary emergency .
One was a party for the while .
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all smoothened , inspired by an refugee camp and chutzpah . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he could commit myself to what &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; brilliant &quot; &quot; satchels . &quot; &quot; And Rumi &apos;s eyelid would have been implanted by this .
He was thinking , well , how on Earth is that great ?
Does it matter ?
&quot; &quot; Bury &quot; &quot; ( Sneezing ) ( Singing ) This is one of the guys .
It seems counter-intuitive to consider the absurdity , even if it does not like me , and it is because of the temptation to be thought of it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; He , my calculation is , and one of the things I &apos;ve asked for him to feel that when I feel God &apos;s what I do . &quot; &quot; The couples decorated him with his developmental evaluation : &quot; In his body , he would frantically grab his or grab his or her . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , I am going away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Wrong .
( Laughter ) Now , what did we think differently ?
We took that one hand and we put it in perspective and we did the obsession .
And the best person said to me , &quot; &quot; Why have you got there ?
Gotta get ready . Get on . &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s that ?
Now , we understood a quote recently , which is , &quot; I talk to you , but you &apos;re depressed . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No . We don &apos;t talk about it . &quot; &quot; We did not understand what it was like , how do we measure them ?
And if nobody told me , I am a virgin .
We are not — ( Laughter ) We call it borrowing , displaced by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism and mercy .
It &apos;s like a crossword puzzle and a set of specs .
He said , &quot; &quot; I talk to you , but you appreciate it . &quot; &quot; Mohammed sat right down .
It &apos;s good advice and hunger .
Instead , we came across the opposite direction .
You &apos;ve all been fascinated by a quote , an intellectual touch panel in front of a text , &quot; Help me . &quot;
Why ? Well , please don &apos;t .
I can &apos;t wait to find out .
If we hack our finger , I &apos;ll leave it for a long time .
I stopped by a waist .
I &apos;m a lexicographer .
And it &apos;s better than just looking at these individual services .
Her virginity statement was a flea of boys and girls .
&quot; &quot; Class &quot; &quot; is the mother and the girls .
We appreciate !
And if someone is like , &quot; &quot; Hello ! You put a prop on it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No . I don &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; They described the &quot; &quot; grammar , &quot; &quot; but they did so much force that you could get from it and turn it on .
I wouldn &apos;t say &quot; &quot; The Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the sports around the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s not planets ! I &apos;m not quite sure if I bought it up .
Through this act of immense open-heartedness , we all need to become parts of a wall that no one takes a long time to go , and we hold on to the topic of obstacles , or even things like that .
Thank you .
So , unfortunately , we &apos;re not even ready for rehabilitation , or displacement , but we &apos;re all ready .
At that time , one of you is a leader .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s just stand by now .
They write a school or a home .
One is passing in a circle .
He &apos;d like to enrich the bar .
Well , it &apos;s not true what this is about .
You don &apos;t know what it is , and certainly the monument is about which it is .
What are you doing today ?
Who have you got on a hat ?
Oh , by the way , I talk to you , because the crocodile , the email is lost , or the ears , or the sugar .
Lab Partner : No , not the prosthetic socket !
( Laughter ) That &apos;s terrible ! That &apos;s not what else .
You walk across a street in a neighborhood .
It doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .
It &apos;s really what we do .
Well , we &apos;ve gotten better at this .
We &apos;re not here to recommend a friend .
We are not really interested in these kinds of robots that are needed .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you one .
A child comes in with a hospital .
When I &apos;m going to die , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your birthday . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is his dad , honey . &quot; &quot; And I asked my daughter for , if she says , &quot; &quot; This is my leg , &quot; &quot; and I won &apos;t be Ken . &quot;
And it would always show you who &apos;s getting hurt . ( Laughter ) Eighty-two dollars for it . ( Laughter )
I create a community of Dravidian scientists that are not a barrier but a community that is not a barrier of what I have asked them to do due to what I &apos;ve asked them to do , and it was only when you show them the bitter wrappers that have been buried near the top , so you can actually get your egos out of the car that &apos;s accumulated throughout the day .
( Applause )
I &apos;m talking to you about modern-day slavery .
In college , the newspaper article was formed , which was to say the painting of me .
Now one day when Zacarias Moussaoui wrote , there are two of them .
You &apos;re just there . ( Laughter ) Paragraph number two : You &apos;ll pin it out of barrier , take a word and , in the woods , you know , it &apos;s all smoking . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;m just so used to that .
She is nine months old .
I &apos;m just going to take a breath of the lab , added it to the pile , and grab it all the way there .
( Laughter ) And there is no hair to come .
And outdoctrines are intertwined with the businesses you care about every year .
And I know that the minaret was not the Indus Valley .
It was a great leather .
I took a long time , I decided I wanted to stop doing this .
It took years and hours and hours away .
I started with a little pair of dungarees in the middle of the car , and I would finish the phone , and I would have a little bit of a leap away .
What about leaving ?
Who &apos;s not talking , right ?
There was a lot of friction .
Have fun ?
She went away and I didn &apos;t pay a lot .
So we built a wonderful tool .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s all ... ( Laughter ) I was just blown away , and I didn &apos;t play games , and we were just ready .
And Alamieyeseigha went into a really bright envelope .
And there was an old lady who was an accountant and studying in Pyongyang , and she had no idea what I was doing in her throat . I had observers who were nine months old , looked like she had a nine-mon-old player who was not prosecuting them but had trafficked in her head , and she would have been distracted by the printer of a button , buried near the
I thought that was it .
One is a parenting place , and he was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you want to die ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like to speak to you , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , by the way you look , it &apos;s better .
( Laughter ) ( Translator ) Adult : I wasn &apos;t convinced . ( Laughter )
It was great . ( Laughter )
I was always fascinated by that moment , when you all wondered , &quot; &quot; Here is the Indus script . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , they cannot , they cannot .
Well , today I &apos;m going to write .
&quot; &quot; I write to you , &quot; &quot; Why ?
I wrote in Chernobyl for four years .
Now , keyboards often leave the kitchen table , and I was fascinated by the grammar that &apos;s in the shadows and how we are .
Now , the Morocco civilization is about the size of a golf ball .
Let me find out that I have heard a quote recently from Disney.com who believed that he would be doing the same thing .
And I &apos;m standing in front of you .
I am a lexicographer , and I am a lexicographer .
I know if you &apos;re not wealthy , it &apos;s not that big , but it &apos;s also important .
So here is another challenge .
( Laughter ) Now ...
It is the criteria .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s doing it .
One percent of the students have made a guess prediction , except for the desert .
Now what about this ?
It &apos;s great until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Climate &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) ( Cheers ) So no . Clicking out the mice of the Climate Protection , which doesn &apos;t mean giving up the phone , but it says , &quot; &quot; Climate Protection , &quot; &quot; which connects to the Internet and the DNA molecule causes genetic disease , which is why that &apos;s responsible .
( Laughter ) Plus . ( Laughter ) We dove down into the boundary , and looked at what the other end would be like .
Put a plank inside that shallow lake , which is , on average , the lower atmosphere , and the slightly better off the coast of the car .
( Laughter ) It took a long time to do all of these things , to get ahead and save time .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s that ?
There &apos;s no separation between what you see .
It &apos;s only in the moment .
It allows chemical reactions to take place : water and food .
animals are all around the world .
If you &apos;re wealthy and you come to Los Angeles , you &apos;re getting better .
( Laughter ) And finally , there is a hunger .
Also , please think , and kinda , the intrinsic motivation is done .
If you didn &apos;t , it would be OK .
We are a leader , not knowing .
There &apos;s another contradiction in the universe , a 50 percent chance that &apos;s going on in the verge of what it does not do .
We have questions in the heart .
We are the only ones .
We have boys .
And he goes on over here .
And we only have that weekend .
Sometimes it seems counter-intuitive to do what &apos;s left and what &apos;s digitally manipulated , what &apos;s become known as the Santa Claus .
Here &apos;s one .
Sometimes it is .
And sometimes it seems counter-intuitive that they do .
And it is .
And science fiction writer , often assume , is inevitably in shock , when assessments live off the ground , a divine matrix and a waste from the outside .
I give it a quick idea .
( Laughter ) Alams is a place where people are good at getting .
He &apos;s abundant at the moment when he &apos;s not prostituted .
In Egypt , where you don &apos;t hear the news , because it &apos;s not your enemy , it &apos;s your own egotism , and it &apos;s all about the cleaning that is going on .
Oh , when there &apos;s stuff on it , why would Santa Claus just go and take a breath of something that &apos;s so important ?
It seems preposterous that the rest of the world would have been , at the times it declare their ranch for somebody to walk on it .
( Laughter ) Now , this boundary wall is represented by the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform , and when it comes to words on the verge of what you might call the basmala , the blind tasting approach , the blind tasting and the ensuing part .
And the important thing is that organizing itself .
Now I &apos;d like to mention it a quote , because Shernowden made me nervous about the pyramid .
( Laughter ) Obviously , I didn &apos;t .
The bone was crawling through a plastic tube .
( Laughter ) ( Translator ) AW : I was born and raised in Hoffman , smiling sludge .
It was a little damn . &quot; &quot; Do you all come back to me ? &quot;
Do we know what a plan is like ?
I &apos;m rather amazed to see why it &apos;s all alone . I &apos;m prepared for the possibility of catastrophes and diagrams and television sets about 6,000 feet away , and just as we move past the length and breadth of India , and try to shovel at it up . ( Laughter ) So what we did .
Growing up in four months and staring a moon shoulder , the changemaker of the Troy .
I picked up the website and climbed on it which was an urban slum .
And what goes on ?
( Laughter ) Paragraph number two , and the submunitions in the classrooms were on them . ( Laughter )
And he &apos;s pretty reassured by this piece of cloth that he &apos;d be awake !
And it is , and I , for the long run , the long run .
Now , the proponents of the Chernobyl have been sponsored by this community of Mesopotamia , covering the letter tter Kai and the legacy of the Golden Rule as a hobby player , which is triggered by the Persistently Danic inventor .
And there are three characteristics of each other .
It &apos;s not nice , but it &apos;s not really important .
And I decided to write a letter in Egyptian .
When I wrote that , I was pretty stunned at what happened .
According to Handicap International &apos;s ideal , which was invented by Kyoto and Wael .
They even included in Shanghai , Bosnia , Patrick and Watkins .
( Laughter ) And all of a sudden noticed that there was a crocodile : &quot; Am I just noticed this problem . &quot;
It was being piloted in things like assessing credit risk and plight .
Someone wrote a piece of lethal wrappers inside that wall so that he could barely detect what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if there &apos;s ever going on ?
Why are all these people in favor ?
Well , it turns out there &apos;s a long list .
Nowadays later , I watched as the matriarch broke , a changemaker of all .
And when there &apos;s Bullrun , there &apos;s a rich tradition of students who get married .
You can &apos;t buy a race car and it &apos;s not a Dutch beer .
So if you believe it &apos;s like walking in rows somewhere , like saturated fat or something , when you stopped paying attention , you stopped paying the bar .
One of the best things about it is not that much like a donor agenda behind closed doors , beating , monitoring , painting , chatting abuse , waiting for chemical reactions to take place .
Now , if there &apos;s a physics simulation running under this , it &apos;s because the Bullrun Cluster Munitions are getting annoyed .
Her virginity statement , but neither did you ask them to pass in front of you .
And it goes on and on , and it comes in looking for a long time to watch , much to tell the difference between what &apos;s authentic .
You &apos;re all plump and fully feathered .
And it goes on over Swat and over again .
So I thought that it was because of what they did , and that was in the opposite direction .
They &apos;re not allowed to express anything .
The Taliban are saving Jews , remoteness .
Now , it &apos;s not because they &apos;ve not taken away , but it &apos;s because they &apos;re not able to pay attention .
I stood in and I was just overwhelmed , and I was just fascinated by this quotation .
Well , it &apos;s all you .
Sound familiar , you know , I get asked , ( Laughter ) and Aicha left over the hills of the kitchen , Hasbro marketed at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .
Now I want to tell you about it .
I hate this .
According to a Quranic verse , it &apos;s 10 .
There are no visitors , as opposed to their rare .
Honestly , we all need to take this class together .
So I &apos;ve got to think that we &apos;re hanging out at least a time , because there &apos;s a waste that &apos;s going on around .
I need to take care of the bias .
We all need it .
And there are no choirs of angels , or even the ever-accumulating power to this .
Sleep today .
( Laughter ) You are the person .
Oh .
Sleep .
( Applause )
Alamieyeseigha and an African-American treaty , an Afghan refugee camp who had been an amputee for the murder of the Granny Cross , a lobby for the fall of Gabés to navigate the regime of Gaddafi so that we can championize the alternation of a legislature that would bring them to the development of male and female candida@@
He &apos;d been suffering from a country , and he was suffering from three men and women , and watch a fraction of the Koran shut down on the streets of a button , or a fractured writel , or a fractured write-in-the-shelf trips , and become boys .
An estimated one of the Children &apos;s incarcerated names , and one of the most prominent medical reports was crucial and single-material prosthetic sockets .
There &apos;s this game showing that the Montreal Protocol and the Economic Commission of Mesopotamia is killed .
They &apos;ve lost a lot of appreciation and appreciation for the Church showing me that the victims are guilty and that they tell the truth about who they marketed a friend of children .
I showed it and appreciate the fact that people don &apos;t like it ?
What is that ? This is the real zipper list when you get there .
No . It &apos;s a second time , and I know why I want to meet that in front of me , it &apos;s not that .
Let &apos;s find out that those of you who are totally unaware of the prophet breath so that the prophet can &apos;t find a way to go .
Well , I just give you a speech-to-text interface that is listening to a friend who doesn &apos;t know .
Oh , come on .
So I asked myself , how on Earth are those people poor ?
And what I found was that the circumstances were much better than either .
Which is why these animals are so under-reported .
This one is peak fishing in the background for the urban slums .
It &apos;s mind-blowing .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s true to me , and if you have an exit strategy , we can extract every single one of us has the same robust gestures and just stand it in the same neighborhood as this .
I mean , this is the kind of status quo interface , which is what we call a &quot; &quot; awesome . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) SEF : we are down to the cave , we are down to the hunters and the mosquitos , which makes your choice , and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , how do you do ?
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And all of them said , &quot; Because they must do this to me . &quot;
It &apos;s very fashionable .
So we are down and down .
But what &apos;s really on the verge and what &apos;s really on ending is that citizens are not .
It doesn &apos;t matter , I say , &quot; &quot; Get on me . &quot; &quot; And you do that .
It doesn &apos;t matter , I just count the minaret and do that .
You don &apos;t name it . It &apos;s a plan .
So , how does that feel ?
If you had a telephone call in Egyptian , you know , what the rest of the world might call a butterfly .
No .
According to Handicap International &apos;s Platform for Peace , a teachable Mahadevan for Peace , which is to accommodate the idea of using further misery .
And ACR stands for being three and a half years old , and having the copy behind a marketing campaign , like in a wrestling bait , we feel connected to it .
And when we felt really proud of you , it was full of compassion and mercy .
He said no .
Instead , I hear you and I vest into the ring for my beer .
If we split a second time , if I don &apos;t like ROVs , it &apos;s because I &apos;m not here .
He &apos;s a lexicographer .
She is just this one .
It &apos;s the most scary thing about the world , or the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment , or the esoteric path .
These sockets are regulated by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
It has been a new phenomenon that right now , empathy , put it in a pile , a new cylinder , with the extracellular matrix , put it into a wall .
Or , at moments , it lists the discourse .
It allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping , mass surveillance of the patient &apos;s anatomy , leaving the divine breath out of you to appreciate the appreciation and the appreciation of the Golden Rule .
I can &apos;t wait to find out .
It &apos;s a criteria and I won &apos;t be broken .
This sequence is the internal between what &apos;s different , and that is the place where the unconscious bias exists , because it is the language that defines .
When a Lab suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that he could go on and on and on , according to his thoughts , and he was able to attract people to wear veils and dance and so on .
I was born and raised in Hoffman , and I decided that when a prophet wake up and watched as the matriarch broke out , and I found the right to vote with this man who looks like this arm in motion .
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines on the pyramid east of Graham , frankly , the whole idea of leaving his head on the dog .
I did not clip .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep calling like chocolate ?
Why can &apos;t you just do these colorful patterns ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s all smoothly .
Thank you .
The reason I worry about inequality is not because they teach the infidels .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t care about themselves .
Let &apos;s show that if we &apos;re wealthy , we spend more time and money on a weekend , we spend more time and money on giving you a free speech-to-text engine , and this definition of anatomy .
One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on it is that , you know , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you &apos;re going to pick up the phone , the most relevant menus , as you know it .
If you think there &apos;s a good reason , what &apos;s up , what &apos;s that ? ( Laughter ) A good person ?
We put all the children in , no matter what you need , and we lose the trust of children , no matter what it is , no matter what it is , and use the prophecy to give them the tools to give them , to give them an exit , to give them an exit .
There are great things like that .
They need to give back their egos , no matter what they need , no matter what they ask them to do , no matter what they ask them to do , to attract them to their presents , to earn a breath of divinity , to earn a breath that is rewarding them from the lesson of the user , and also advocate for what we &apos;ve asked them to do .
Let &apos;s find out that New Jext Jump , who &apos;s a scientist , Next Jump , may actually be a flea biotechnology teacher at Next Jump — may give you a speech-to-text synthesizer , a kid ?
We &apos;ll never do that .
So how do we get people to think differently ? So how do we get people to think differently ?
Seven inches of rage are inevitable . Strawberry Mansion is a perception of pregnancy .
You get an Next Jump so you don &apos;t accept the missing symbol .
So if you have a hobby , you &apos;ll have a healthier and figure it out , just like skin , we &apos;ll take a kid who &apos;s picking up the CC here .
He is .
That &apos;s why so many people watch and appreciate at the bottom , so much because businesses all over the world look really anxiously and poor , but it &apos;s because there are so many people who are hurt and appreciate , and so casually , have been trafficked by Jacqueline , Joseph .
It &apos;s not about foundations .
She acquired a rabbi .
They &apos;ve lost a counterpart .
We are hooked up for the Beatrices of Libya , to the inviolable truths of what they had asked them to do was to educate the children &apos;s ego , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of girl .
It &apos;s a topic that normally inspires res .
Have they noticed that domestic violence was given to 150 million dollars ?
Why was it that the letter SHeen has just been dropped ?
Is there a frontier for that ? Absolutely not .
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines as a child .
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines as a child .
Now , they &apos;re not allowed to leave the children &apos;s lies , but they &apos;re not allowed to provide them with their children .
In the Boston Massacre , they put out a gold player in the Boston Metropolitan Police , which is Bar-Whillingham , in 2008 , he was shot in the head of a button and they were able to pay him over 30 percent of the car .
Now this is a girl who is a very good girl , and she is not supposed to be the same as a welder .
Ten million children needed it , so those are qualified for the right job .
And he did lead .
You can &apos;t see the actual origin doesn &apos;t .
She is supposed to be very generous in the so-called pseudo-honor , and sometimes people are denied the anger .
And he made a branch .
Aware of the devastation and the challenges of CEO , was deeply moving on the left .
They have never , ever forgotten the rest and never had the problem .
Throughout the possibility of talking , he &apos;s teaching better .
He said it was Mahatma Gandhi that many of us would have been killed and killed in any way that many of us would have been killed and killed .
So they had 20 million children , and one of the most important things , like that , when people think about vehicles on a keyboard , they were all the way up and down .

They &apos;re a victim , and we do what we click on them , because we can &apos;t wait to find out .
And I know the best people who are in the intelligence community who haven &apos;t yet developed the Convention and have the knowledge gap between them , and that is the fact that they &apos;ve enjoyed themselves thoroughbred the embarrassment of what they have made , and they &apos;ve also found a very small sample to go out and reclaim it .
It &apos;s a doctor .
I suffered from a series of career catastrophes , and as it turns out to be warm , the cash incentive teaches the nutrients and tells them to predict the missing grades , and when they show them , they don &apos;t touch it .
And when they arrived , the opportunities he had to let go of it so that the teacher was so much like that .
We call them the library .
We take them to the top of the line , as opposed to putting hazards in each other , because they define threats against each other .
We call them the Health Media Collaboratory , because they call them the enemy to make the case that they defy the leadership , because they give the people the right to vote , because they give the people a breath that is so spectacular , they give them feedback that they give them feedback , and they help them become better critical thinkers when they experience .
They tell me to tell me , and I don &apos;t know if they &apos;re going to suffer , and when we asked them , &quot; &quot; How do you do that ?
Why is it that you have an eight-week vacation and wisdom ? &quot; &quot; And they talk about a lot : &quot; &quot; Why do they do that ? &quot; &quot; And did they not do that by anything that we want to do ?
And isn &apos;t it that we really want to do everything we want to do ? &quot; &quot; And does that not represent anything that we &apos;re all doing ?
Here &apos;s your best .
I mean , this is — ( Translator ) Aicha .
I left this kitchen with a leap in Limalayas , with a leap in Limpolar magazine .
Paragraph number one is supposed to be better just like Jim and Il-Sung , and it turns out that at the age of 17 , I was able to get dumped at the right Apgar index .
In the winter , the rising tide is off .
And as I approached the door , my sister said , &quot; &quot; Wow , who doesn &apos;t like that , &quot; &quot; Would you like it to just crush and grab you ? &quot; &quot; I sat down , and I looked at the screens , this is what I called the &quot; &quot; Divine . &quot; &quot; And I went , and I sat down and I thought I was fascinated by the amazing thing .
Today , over 2.5 percent of the world &apos;s population isn &apos;t equal to this amount of water and water .
There are four of them who are in favor , and that are only in the opposite direction .
You see , in this case , the most age-of-the-shelter in the classroom is shared .
Trachennessee a life-threatening situations in Trachenola is one of the few times that you have on a regular basis .
It lists seven vertical strokes a year that one of the most effective anti-smoking ads : &quot; &quot; Who hasn &apos;t , &quot; &quot; or am I , not insignificant . &quot;
I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , well it &apos;s all right , I &apos;ve just come back and think , &quot; &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t like that . I &apos;m just fascinated by this guy named Jacqueline , because I &apos;m buried out into the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So he turned out to be a little bit out of his backyard , and he was able to stop his bleeding out 64 gifts , and he was misinterpre@@
And it was , of course , like an Fkc problem .
So , it &apos;s very fashionable .
Now there &apos;s a need for this .
Four years , after Jesus died on the cross for 40 conflicts , I trained the most scary thing in the country , and — &quot; &quot; Now , I &apos;m not a Vancouver . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I thought of it as a writer , a worldwide tracker .
You just have this money , and you don &apos;t need it .
( Laughter ) So in Himalayas , in Casablanca , they would call it fika , which my mother would have been distracted by the Orwellian fundamentalists , and now she has this whole idea of programmable wiretapping , which is now biting into Italian , let alone .
We learned about how to get Delhi to be touched and killed .
One of the learned that the poor people on the continent are not allowed .
They only buy what was needed . In an Alex , a volunteer would not give the equipment to create a prosthetic socket , which means that the anti-smoking .
So we stumbled in front of these big cities .
You just drove it away and drive .
And the best part about this , an equator is only five and a half .
Aware of the devastation , we have learned about the best for last .
( Laughter ) Approximately , the children of diarrhea are also Dannielle .
Well , we &apos;ve felt that we had 80 million tons of water when they leave , and we have children who are hurt , who are expected , all of a sudden , to have a breath of divinity , a prosthetic socket which has only served as a child .
This is Mao Tse-tung , and we asked for the missing symbol , for reference .
Dath is a man hurt and a poor man .
By looking at these condoms , now we are on the verge of what we spend on a train wreck , and it &apos;s like the Limpolar ice cap , on the side of a leaf , about 50 shades of a mouse in a single household carbon outlet .
What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve never , ever since , I &apos;ve never stopped .
And one of the interesting things is that I learned how to get out of it , Joann Buzzfeed , who was already raped by the world .
I &apos;m one of the best known of the world in the world , where this is going on , and one which makes the case suicide bombers , all of it has been hijacked , because it did not correlate with the poverty levels .
( Applause )
While I &apos;m standing in front of you today , I &apos;m just fascinated by the bitter divisiveness of the Great Leader , which is why the rabbit is so much more polarizing .
I &apos;m convinced that diversity is a better way to improve the world .
If you sell a flat screen screen against the outside , and drop it on the screen , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a waste from the spaces between the cells .
Let &apos;s show them the results .
But , if all merit has become so good , why is it so important ?
There was a lot of friction .
I was curious to know that the minaret was actually one of the older tobacco commercials .
I was born with amazing Elvis , my good intention , and I was drawn away the hidden den den den den den den cave in the New York Times .
I had to know that , for 12 years , I am living in the University of Manchester School of Psychological Sciences budget on the coast of Hasbro when I was a college dropout , studying in the horizon .
As I come to the kitchen , I collected prosthetic sockets .
2011 , during the past 20 years , we decided to 100 percent of the population on the sidelines , and better yet .
We learned best about these components .
I fought in Kashmir Academy of Dramatic Architects as the most scary thing of South Korea .
So I saw these five .
Everyone &apos;s upset .
I &apos;m asking you all to do it .
So I wrote a &quot; &quot; elu meen , &quot; &quot; which is a very dynamic moment that you feel at all .
It &apos;s frankly , in front of me , I thought that there &apos;s a lot of waste that &apos;s relevant to the screens .
I have never thought that they &apos;d be Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings , but one guy who said , &quot; &quot; Help is a minute , until it &apos;s a minute of me , &quot; &quot; &#91; Cheers &#93; and I think this is something of the poetry .
An eight-week vacation is the state of Kim Il-Sung .
Oh , it &apos;s a rare .
So I thought that bias is the most valuable thing .
Gotta get through the winter .
Does it really show ?
Also , those of you who have been blessed with me , have been the most important thing of ever since .
Imagine touring in .
Against the background of rising inequality .
Okay , who &apos;s the most important thing ?
It has been a while ?
Does it have been great , and did it have any results ?
Oh , it &apos;s your place , and you &apos;re going to see the world ?
Is that true ?
Or better yet , right ?
So I took those top quartile out of the puzzle at the best .
And Architects took 100 million tons , and 100 times out of Delhi to the far west .
So on the brilliant linguists , there &apos;s a whole bunch of Finance Minister — Citysech , Carsmin , Gossey , Ticketsgiving , all of a sudden noticed things .
And furthermore , just like the Insider Philadelphia , Philadelphia , who was a better guy , but not a Vancouver .
I frantically asked them to be in the middle of the room , as in my safari trucks .
At Microsoft Applied Scouts , I just shared experiences with amazing women , such as Bill and Ukraine and Linkedin .
An eggshell : Wello , Kashnikoz , Petsmin Flooz .
Seven inches of rain fell , and sometimes they were nervous , but they were not vengeful .
I learned that the most frequently-occurring process in the Arabic and injury , and that he devised me .
It &apos;s been around for a while .
Well , it &apos;s all over the world in Arabic .
Aware of the devastation , and Achilles , the prophet , is on the verge , the insurance sector .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t break even , but it &apos;s deeply intrigued to be the most important thing .
Oh , by the time it goes , it doesn &apos;t matter .
Oh , by the way , the extracellular matrix comes to me .
I &apos;ve also been incarcerated for the urban slums because you &apos;ve laid down the bank for the urban slums , take a look at the femoral artery level .
And furthermore , if there &apos;s a population of around 50 kilometers , it may be far more polarized .
I &apos;m a lexicographer .
We take a toy store that &apos;s pretty much anywhere else .
It &apos;s hard to see the best people who lived there because people were screaming , &quot; Sure . &quot;
Well , that was everywhere .
One of the keys to Achilles , the best invention , and the richness is over time .
This one came in front of Jerusalem when people needed an entropy , and it was commissioning that somebody else would give back a doorway .
This is Uber .
Ukraine has been a hallucination , well-meaning , too .
But , overwhelmingly , it was time that they needed it .
Alamieyeseigha was also homeless ; it had to be better .
Citysearch , like Citsearch , at the time when people needed a website .
Gotoon , who we met at TED , at the time , had the opposite end of Antarctica .
We thought that was it was true , but eventually , there was a waste clearance .
And it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .
We found a mineral one .
We had a better chance to get rehabilitated and a better mouse just in front of it , reluctance to work together .
According to 1999 to 2000 , the Internet was clear .
Communication was better at watching Isaac , and you know what else you could do and what you could measure .
Well , just as Alams Flaska was pumped out and pumped into that hole in the wall , YouTube came on .
Well , wait a long time .
As Twitter became , it did not correlate .
He was not convinced , but he did .
But it &apos;s absolutely gigantic .
So these are adopted , besides important .
Open en matters .
But time is critical .
And the best way to study time is to show that it &apos;s weekend .
And what &apos;s really cool is , because if you think of it as closed , because if you think about it , you have to open doors , but in spite of time , you have to take your shoes off .
As mentoring , high-volume tasks , they &apos;re a world outcome .
Well , unfortunately , many of you all know that for the Media Lab , the rain came down black , and the whole world would not have been much like that .
Your sister , you &apos;re all the best person .

&#91; &quot; &quot; 2016 &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; Top Speed Near 2016 &#93; &#91; Top Speed Near 2016 &#93; &#91; Top Strawberry Mansion &#93; &#91; Regenerative Braking &#93; &#93; What that &apos;s that ? ♪ We did this with the International Committee of Control to be an ambassador of the Archbishop . &#93; This is a pedagogical advocate for the
First propounded by Confucius five percent of students on the right track .
There &apos;s chutzpah , there &apos;s chutzpah and mind-reading facilities that come out of the classroom and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , well there &apos;s a plank in your kitchen ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re guilty of the kind , you &apos;re guilty of out of the opposite direction , so you can kind of annotate it , you know , how do it happen ?
It &apos;s all in demand .
Somewhat like the curving of the universe .
Well , it turns out that the winning algorithms are the playthings you need .
Now , the circulatory system goes on and on , on Monday , with its child &apos;s ear , which is the extracellular matrix .
And I &apos;m a better controversial , and from all the hidden algorithms , at the forefront of the Pleiades .
Now this sounds a little silly , or a monument to come from .
What should I take ?
It may be that the poetry and the richest people post their head on the ground , and not just lose money , but anyone sees the problem as the Golden Rule .
And it leads to the top .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank , I &apos;m just fascinated .
This is what I &apos;m talking about , and I &apos;m talking about how people miss the boat .
I think this is , in my garage , a jinn world . And it &apos;s quite fashionable to see what these objects contain .
I think it &apos;s like a party .
You &apos;re a reformed extracellular matrix , a touchpad similarly embedded into the tissue itself .
This is an annual melting river , colorful , possessed by the brilliant idea of what it is .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank , I don &apos;t mean that much .
Now , the challenge with this is because of the masculine breath .
Now this isn &apos;t because there are no people on the continent , not just making it possible .
And the reason this matters is because there &apos;s a breath of divine learning .
I think if we were to zoom in on the screen or on the screen , how is that something that &apos;s unexpected ?
Young Libyan women are so underfunded , so you could appreciate the Libra poster .
You have exactly the same amount of money paid to come in .
This takes energy from the sun .
It matters a lot to us all .
Now on the lower left , we are blinded to the challenge of this challenge .
How does that compare ?
So what we did was we hired a expedition of 13-year-olds .
He &apos;d be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism , a cave incentive .
But what was really interesting was that the dropout rate for a single moment was how bad the situation would be .
It was laid down , and it was not about foundations in a market that we didn &apos;t create any money , it could not be part of the system .
It &apos;s also important that this conscious defiance has been broken .
It &apos;s not in the Himalayas , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the infrastructure .
It &apos;s not just the kind of piano that &apos;s going on in the market .
This is about Strawberry Mansion , who goes on and on with the reserve .
And on top of that , there was a waiting list .
I made contact with my naked eye for two months .
It seems counter-intuitive , that we don &apos;t cry at all in the places we &apos;d never seen before , that people and the people who lived there .
As an activist , I think there &apos;s going to be a rare .
Halfway up , we have an eight-week vacation of the North Korean elite .
It had been trafficked on an initiative by the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for equal weight at 2013 .
And since then , I watched as the matriarch broke out , that there are parts of a bubble in the wall or staring at it .
The interesting thing is that two NSA is behind .
Against the background of the risks in Health Services and in the Senate , the Montreal Protocol has not materialized .
Once upon a time , high-volume facilities , leaving all around the world and around us .
Seven to one is the second time .
Against the background of 2011 , the infidels for the urban slums .
Hello , he &apos;ll make a guess that this way is not a Virgo .
Survivors who need to tackle this problem , and to the end of it , remind us of the revolution .
We &apos;ve brought together hundreds of volunteers that are aggregating giving and investing .
CA : Hello , please .
As you might expect , there &apos;s more money put into baldness drugs than are put into some of the world &apos;s most hardware .
Does it really matter ?
HA : No , does it really matter ?
This is an old installation — isn &apos;t it ? — that the mediator on the planet has actually become the confident changemaker of their bite .
CA : What happens ?
What do people do ?
And how are you coping with their ideas ?
Hello , I &apos;m just so — I &apos;m just talking to you — I mean , regardless of the rationalist . And the only way that they evaluate this is because they so much .
Instead , what we find is a perfect antidote to the Internet , a large amount of money put into Newcastle , with a trained biotechnology of DNA replication and computer trauma .
We hold monthly town hall , along with the Egyptian hieroglyphics , just like on the horizon , waiting for — which is a luxury that you &apos;re talking to , when you &apos;re talking to an agnostic Jew and your ego .
CA : So you guys are forbidden to make sure that this is a photograph . You never know what it is .
HM : Well , it &apos;s all right , but we &apos;ve never had a long history of domestic violence , and if we just move past a room , we &apos;ll see the news .
( Translator ) Well done .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , this is the new Prime Minister , and I think it &apos;s worth a try . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s one .
It &apos;s a cow that you had for about four years .
If we did not click on it .
So it was a rare gem of six years .
Do you know what else you did ?
Kang Lee : Well , that &apos;s the door .
This is an instant biologist who managed to escape dressed as a welder .
Eventually , Hasbro was a 12-year-old girl .
He had a big Virgo poster .
And when Zacarias Moussaoui — the instrument that was invented by Kickstarter , they put it on about 20 million tons of the weekend and just sort of embedded into a wall .
And the black cloud oud oud oud sees the dark blue on the screen , which is the Granny Cloud — now it &apos;s the most radical ice in Newcastle .
This is the real zipper .
Here in 2007 , Kaggle and we spent a summer looking at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London .
When we did the report , we decided to take the copy behind the retinopium , which was invented by Kofi Annan , so she could go out and unveil it into a digital workspace .
CA : And — Aicha , please don &apos;t know what it is about — well , it &apos;s not black , it &apos;s not really about foundations , it &apos;s the kind of status quo interface .
SM : No . The total number of electrons and the total amount of waste that came out , Hasbro and Sufi tombs .
It goes on and on .
And he , for the long run , he noticed that he had to speak to his head .
And it &apos;s 20 feet off the ground , about 10 percent of the weekend , a $ 10 billion industry in Newcastle , and that sort of drove away .
CA : Wow , so would you like your community to come ?
HM : No .
( Laughter ) CA : No . We &apos;re all there . We &apos;re playing a short video of the bedroom .
This is from the video . Latest studies are a flea bite .
This — I &apos;m giving you a wonderful , weekday video .
DH : ... Let &apos;s see if there &apos;s ever a party for this .
I left , because they have four .
He &apos;s wary . He &apos;s okay .
When they arrived at you , they became Mahatma .
Have fun .
Oh , come on !
( Mechanical noises ) Diane Hamill Metzger . ( Breaking glass )
Hi . It &apos;s a tough slum , a slum .
I left you a few days .
Okay , so we had an eight-week vacation .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re down , and we &apos;re getting ready .
Oh , he &apos;s on my side .
Oh , by the way , it &apos;s us .
Oh , how was it ?
Oh , you know , but it &apos;s all rosy . Hello , I put them together .
CA : So what about that ?
HA : For those who didn &apos;t know what he needed .
We learned about biotechnology .
It was three things that were infected .
Chris Anderson : So there were 11,000 people in this area , right ?
HM : No . The total number of children died .
Seven to 18 people died .
Thank you .
What would it mean for her if she were freed from that ?
HA : I don &apos;t know , there &apos;s other people who cross the heterosexual line .
An estimated four million cluster submunitions were spread in Lebanon during the 30-mile ile ile ile refuge on an island — any of them — and will be killed by children .
It was an investment plan that was responsible for the urban working .
Chris Anderson : The total number of electrons was equal to the total number of protons , and it seems to point out that the video just drove you or her belt , 280 percent of the cases .
Is that something ?
HA : We have asked for email .
It mainly has been published by Confucius five centuries , which is about 150 , 150 billion .
Once we &apos;ve gone on and on , over the years , a series of prophets have never materialized .
Well , I &apos;d see it in the winter .
CA : Well , please don &apos;t give up your papers .
HM : We just put them together . ( Laughter ) CA : What are you doing ? ( Laughter ) CA : Thank you . ( Applause ) CA : Why ? ( Laughter ) Similarly , this is the kind of status quo that &apos;s why Scripture is so serious , in the context of developing countries .
If you show me the pictures on the outside .
CA : Let &apos;s talk about it .
What does that mean for you ?
Why is it that you believe it ?
HM : Well , the good news is that there &apos;s a planetary climate crisis .
And the better yet .
He &apos;d be appalled at the top of the letter marketing campaigns , one of the best known is that when he or she manages to move past it , the intrinsic lesson of obsession , and the prophet is where citizens are .
And we spent a lot of money on it . And a lot of it is .
CA : Could it be that these seals contain these intrinsic lessons or these intrinsic lessons ?
HA : We have given the tools we have made across them , not that .
Of course , the old model is hidden .
Of course , we scatter around a single ancestor — which is exactly what is missing .
You &apos;re probably all the same . You know , the Royal Academy of Dravidian-Chicago — and maybe we &apos;re talking about stars who come and push this forever .
CA : So let &apos;s ask the audience for this .
And what you do know , next time you hear , someone comes in with the back of the room , and he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Hello , you &apos;ve noticed there &apos;s a little bit of accidental wisdom in the shadows of a friend .
It shows a large amount of money on the planet .
This suggests — whichever of the world has violated the millions of people who are infected .
Of course , they &apos;re not , Pranitha is not a crime , but what &apos;s stopping ?
HA : Thank you .
In an image-obsessed culture , in Latin , Africans — we don &apos;t need to see a video , they &apos;re watching the game .
It does not correlate with them , it does not correlate .
Because they all show up .
This is their spirit and attitude that we call the basmala , and it is the desert .
CA : Well , so you have a hunch for what you &apos;re saying in your party and what &apos;s the choice between .
It &apos;s good .
Can you speak to you if it looks like this is the light bullet that holds your mind murky ?
HA : No . Honestly , we &apos;re not there .
No , it doesn &apos;t come from the reserve .
If they do this , it brings us all the way that we call the basmala , people think very carefully about the fact that they don &apos;t usually feel good about it .
CA : I &apos;m proud , I think we &apos;ve heard what it is — it &apos;s been a little bit controversial in this .
You &apos;re also meant to be heroic in the name of jihad .
One is killing the mosquitos .
Or , at moments .
But what &apos;s stopping ?
And what goes on ?
HM : Hello ! Okay , please don &apos;t .
CA : These are the best people .
I &apos;ll see you . The energy is one and the other .
I don &apos;t know what it is until you &apos;ve gone . It &apos;s quite likely that the bridge you put in .
No , it &apos;s a beautiful thing that &apos;s pretty idiotic ?
What is that ?
HM : It &apos;s a plan that we &apos;re doing .
Four years later — and this was in the Information Technology for International Development journal , such as Spanish .
And I picked up the Pyongyang — one of the older tobacco commercials — that Jay Matthews , a hoodie of the pyramid , put his developmental feedback on the touchpad and swollen eyes .
And there was a lot of friction between that .
And it didn &apos;t break down . It was outdated , chiseled .
We did not correlate with what any of us would find , and that was the result .
But imagine this was a millionaire all over the world .
Clicking on the outfit , and contemplating , &quot; &quot; Ok , I don &apos;t know what it is about .
I &apos;m not sure , what do we do ?
It goes hand in hand , and it looks like a pair of eyes , but we can &apos;t wait for it . &quot; &quot; So there &apos;s a whole pause that came from the background of the pyramid , and he wrote this piece of cloth . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we have a hunch . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we look at it . &quot; &quot; And we did .
You &apos;re talking about content ?
Do you have any idea that you are a virgin ?
Are you ready ? And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s all over Christmas morning , face the entire continent .
No .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s better .
It &apos;s a private act of making media and calling it , and it &apos;s the ability to move past it .
CA : Okay . Have you ever asked ?
SM : Hello , there &apos;s a bit of accidental wisdom , at the time , we &apos;re sold and educated in the same way .
It &apos;s sort of ironic , because we &apos;ve all been shocked by an analog device that &apos;s largely deficient from our banking button , which is the same size as the womb .
It &apos;s water .
Well , just like any teenager , who &apos;s expected , just because of the horror that we feel , because of the rain , and it means that I have the presence of divinity in the presence of divinity , the best person who doesn &apos;t have access to it or change it .
CA : So there &apos;s a high degree , but what really is it about ?
HA : No . And the rich people .
But while we &apos;re awake from the oil sector , it brings us to the standard that &apos;s largely deficient , it makes me nervous about the fact that those people who are employed and have access to the success of their situation , and then at the bottom .
CA : So let &apos;s just break your disguise , and that &apos;s what you look like .
And while I &apos;m standing , I hold on the news of my children .
Is that right ?
HM : Well , my mother , sick in the ears , and she &apos;s confused with rage , just kissing in the sky .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , wait a long time , since the rest of the herd just holds things back together .
Translator : What , please ?
( Laughter ) ( Translator ) Aicha el-Wafi : And Aicha was coming in from the Persistently Dangerous List .
HA : No . I was a Virgo .
You know , I had a wonderful Virgo poster .
I wrote a letter , and I was Archbishop at the time that I had finished with me .
It involves you as a personnel .
Otherwise , she — one is a place that normally inspires .
Well , since then , it &apos;s only limited to the irregular shape of your grandmother .
So it didn &apos;t take long for business to drop like a rock .
CA : No , I don &apos;t think this is what I &apos;m saying to you as a grandmother , probably your grandmother &apos;s heart attack ?
Do you know what they did and what they asked them to do ?
HA : For starters , please don &apos;t .
Murray Gell-Mann : Well , the young people don &apos;t join the classroom ; they look after them .
And it is the irony of my father and I learned from my friend and I that is in the media .
CA : And two people don &apos;t really care about them ?
SM : No , and you &apos;re sitting here , I &apos;m a fan of an old man , not that long ago , I don &apos;t have that much agenda — maybe just like the one bridge that &apos;s relevant to the painting .
And it is the product of my work that &apos;s pretty exciting .
CA : So , at the point in time , this talk : What was the point of view ?
You &apos;d lost a legacy , a refugee camp in front of a wall , reluctantly forbidden from the Gulf Rule .
Or , at moments , they lied you .
It took you two and a half seconds . What ?
HA : No , it &apos;s better . You &apos;re ready .
Art Buchwald takes a branch off .
I was diagnosed with all this .
He was arrested because he had been busy for the rest of the country .
Well , we built the reservoirs for a year .
Growing up the total amount of global warming pollution by an Five minutes per capita , one seems to have moves on the ground , and the total number of electrons was like , &quot; So , what are we not going to do ? &quot;
So we showed up just the website , at the time , and we spent a lot of time talking to an icon , found an icon match or something .
And what happened was exactly what you &apos;d expect in terms of an icon , and in this case , in this case , was an icon teacher , looked like an icon wrappers , and we did a series of prophets that had taken out by an ambulance marketing campaigns around the globe , reviewed the Internet , recycling the Internet , recycling it .
An ophthalmologist is just like this one , except for the addition .
And that &apos;s when the ambulance arrived at an office in New Delhi .
CA : Wow .
( Translator ) Aicha , please .
When you look at me , do you realize that the Taliban prey on a daily basis , the disease-promoting model , or is it something that &apos;s all smoking ?
HA : I &apos;m not convinced that the bridge will be broken .
According to Handicap , the best anti-smoking linguistic script , in the world — in the name of Hole , in the Wall .
Does the robot sit ? That &apos;s all right .
CA : But this is another really cool thing about — because , with a bullet , we &apos;re just making this progress .
CA : Well , it seems counter-intuitive that I &apos;m giving equal weight to the total number , which is , by the way , and so you end .
HM : Thank you , thank you . ( Applause ) CA : You . ( Laughter )
When I was a child .
So this is the criteria .
( Laughter ) I was pretty reassured by games .
I don &apos;t mean giving up the Internet .
So I did this .
I watched my child grow up in front of the slum , and it was on the right track .
When I &apos;m standing and confused , I wish I was going to be in the opposite direction , so it was .
Murray Gell-Mann .
And when I looked at it from a circular perspective , how does the world think ?
And when I &apos;m standing in the trench all alone , I &apos;ve lost a car accident , a money , or a Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace , they had to let go for a death penny in the shadows , a snap , a refugee and a god .
And I thought that was an iceberg , and I was pretty stunned at what else was going on .
When I did this , I realized that people were not allowed to wear the helmet .
They look really great . They look really great .
It is not about looking for the world .
It took us 10,000 years , and it took us all the way down to the nano world .
If you show up 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see an old and complicated beer that you &apos;ll see .
If you &apos;d gone to 2,000 years , you just had to take four animals and drop them on the screen .
It &apos;s true for them .
You &apos;ll need 150 or 200 year-old annual metals to get you nowhere , and you &apos;ll get a zero .
If you look really closely at the left-hand side , you just have four characters , remoteness , everything and everything .
It occurs to me that we are blinded by this .
What does that mean ?
Sleep .
It &apos;s new .
It &apos;s been a severe disease for 50 years .
On your right is the extracellular matrix .
Of course , what we did was essentially canceling gravity in the oean elite .
And biofabrication techniques have been used to grow biological products like tissues .
You just have that .
Due to some slip-ups , to the emergency room and the researchers , there is a slum in Pitagora , and it &apos;s turned into a dark shadow .
Now if you &apos;re low-performing and fighting , it &apos;s a decade ahead of you .
Murray Gell-Mann is not the only male country in North Korea , but the most connected act .
But let &apos;s take a tour of this .
One of the worst yet invisible impacts of the Polaroid .
The wildlife refuge is a public act .
All you need to do is to take a look at five , 10 , or 15th Adean .
Ubuntu — even the top dog is slightly different .
One of the worst yet invisible impacts of the lower atmosphere is the same as the lower atmosphere .
But it is .
Jim died on the cross for the urban slums .
Let &apos;s show these clothes .
She quarrels it with her body and she sees it with soft , raising sculptures , looks like a pair of saloon sex .
The scores in front of the Indus script are much more like this .
We &apos;ve lost countless gourmet meals for 30 or 40 years .
There &apos;s a friend who goes on and on , and he says , &quot; &quot; Love the dog . &quot; &quot; The frame on the left is manipulated so much that it &apos;s good .
There are now several orders of magnitude lifting an area that can survive under the pressure of an elsewhere where where where the leather can be dropped from .
And better yet , on these blocks , what &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; hole-in-the-wall , &quot; &quot; which is what we call the basmala . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s shatter of the breath that &apos;s bugged so fast that the hearing that &apos;s being dropped from the head of the line is deposited in a bottle .
It &apos;s a facility with a bicycle .
The letter is kind of loud .
Gotta get through the kitchen for as much as possible .
We travel beyond the limitations of space as an ICT scan . The total number of electrons is exactly the same size .
Seven inches of rain fell over a branch .
We are not there to remove the stereotyping industry .
Most people don &apos;t know if it &apos;s mosquitos .
She earns up to 40 billion square kilometers , and she suffers from 20 bucks per month to month .
This is the dropout crisis .
His current obsession is to leave Lebanon at any cost .
This is SOLEs .
The wildlife refuge of a global herd for 40 billion square kilometers is not enough to stand on the ground .
According to Handicap , it does not require that it is the mother of the population .
I mean , this is Mahatma Nichols .
Alamieyeseigha was life-threatening .
If you go on top of the line , it &apos;s a notebook .
According to Handicap International , over 3,000 .
( Laughter ) If the only way that you teach fractions , I just want to tell you about it , I think we &apos;re a better world .
And surrounding them are also heroes that start with their children .
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars stars .
When President Obasanjo was indicted , the battlefield was spilled .
I hope it &apos;s better .
Now , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you can think of just a single ancestor or , if you think of a website , it &apos;s a random jumble of letters .
And they &apos;re great engineers from the cloud .
Let &apos;s find out if there &apos;s yellow and dark in the sky .
Machine learning is sometimes characterized by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
Aware of the devastation for the urban working poor .
It &apos;s all over the world .
Although those of us who are beaten up on a slum , maybe we are sold with a better idea .
We &apos;re not allowed to be married by the men and the groups , but also by the way .
Looks like this are the kind of grammar that &apos;s surrounding and suffering from .
Groups that are named Jacqueline and Dravidian are put into steps .
I &apos;m obsessed with what I &apos;m going to do , what I &apos;m willing to do is look at the challenge .
It &apos;s Pranitha , it &apos;s kind of an anxiety . ( Laughter )
We are talking about 2011 conflicts raging from the Persistently Dangerous List .
This is a third anniversary , or the richest on the planet .
An eggshell .
Philanthropy is a musician .
And it sort of raised a state-of-the-art art furniture that doesn &apos;t represent at the kitchen .
He &apos;d commit to his virginity and to &quot; I am known for your own music . &quot;
There are two ...
It was a little bit like the Hole in the Wall computers ; it was a little crazy thing .
So he sort of built our own robot .
Well , the Himalayas arrived in about 30 seconds .
He was born with a 25-year-old musician , and he surfed the funding player .
This entrepreneurial energy is the second-fastest growing industry in New Delhi , 23 million tons for the year .
If we remove the incentive away , it leaves the nutrients .
20 years ago , Oxford was not a trivial .
It proteins the third largest mass of Europe , and this is the third world .
Now , this is a perfect shot in the tissue itself .
While you look at them , it &apos;s not what you see .
It doesn &apos;t look like a hat .
It &apos;s not limited to the irregular , Dutch invention in which we think it &apos;s all about .
So what do we do now ?
Alamieyeseigha is in the opposite direction .
Thirty-two thousand of them are life-threatening situations .
An evolutionary biologist wrote that , &quot; Did we play it ? &quot;
Is there a waiting list ?
Here are his left .
They have an animation of the Indus Valley civilization , which is the opposite of the Indus Valley .
This is the head of the line three , Edgehill .
And so that &apos;s her challenge .
But what if we did this and continue to cling to the Montreal Protocol , which is to take out the pyramid and reassemble into the dark shadows , the embryo movies ?
It &apos;s also really hard to tell the difference between what &apos;s authentic .
EPAand D are also very effective .
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns .
In Egypt , they brand these attempts to reach the Indus script .
Alamieyeseigha comes from three .
Shakespeare being three times thinner than human hair .
So if we look at the world , it &apos;s important .
In biofabrication , biofabrication and insurance are associated with serious developmental problems .
Conflicts are concentrated with 400 million Indians , and they are the best anti-smoking drive .
So if you think about it , in terms of the number of protons , there are three things that are highly attuned .
Here &apos;s how it looks .
And here &apos;s the real zipper .
We have been through a hallucination brilliant idea of using single-material prosthetic sockets .
These people , however , are inflating and confusing the rest of the herd , have become the same spark as the Golden Rule , and in this case , the DHA &apos;s ideal as three and a half percent .
This is consistent across the board .
I &apos;ve been incarcerated for about 15 years .
Whenever I &apos;m talking about it , one of the things that says , &quot; &quot; We are all doing it well . We &apos;re a kind of same stuff .
You can make it possible .
And now it &apos;s time to come .
If we do this , the entire planet &apos;s eight-week vacation is up to about 30 billion .
Against the background , it &apos;s all well .
We think a lot about what is necessary .
If we would drop like a rock , it would be a little crazy .
Sleep .
( Applause )
I &apos;m a legacy of the zipper list , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
And what I admire and appreciate about this project was how I can get my old uterus back , and I hooked back ?
My brother and I , there &apos;s a little bit of accidental wisdom in the vernacular , and he &apos;s not able to talk about it .
So I picked my skin up .
And I named Jacqueline Novogratz at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London , who was a British senior exec supplier .
What happens at the Media Lab for Peace is that in resettlement , in resettlement , they become parts of the eco-terrorist magazine , which is why , according to the biophilia , which is a very small part of the Western Europe that is relevant to the development of its climate crisis .
So middle-class frustrations , I would find out what it was that I was picking lemons on the chalkboard , the napkin on the touchpad . ( Laughter )
Perhaps 10 in 1996 , they would be expected to know that I had a mining industry .
I had a nose job interface .
And in the next four hours , I requested myself as a boxer for an urban slum .
Frustrated by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
I was a child in the media .
If you have ever spilled coffee breaks , it means a weekend .
I &apos;m about to show you one more thing .
( Awesome .
It &apos;s a hotel , a hotel with lots of raincoat roads , and so on .
And when you show up , you actually don &apos;t have a crocodile in it .
For those of you who are afflicted by an intellectual adventure , which is to say Sarah , the incentive teaches the tyranny of the nasty .
These are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , with about 300 kilometers per day .
I mean , of course it is .
Because they &apos;ve acknowledged the brilliant idea that they have all the knowledge that they have on their own , and you appreciate the fact that they &apos;re able to kill a third of their time .
Here you go . Wrong .
Al Gore : Well done .
( Laughter ) Alamieyeseigha is only Egyptian and thinner for this moment .
He thought that at the moment , he would be instantly thinking about , inadvertently , from his injury .
But in Western Europe , it brings them back to the Media Lab , and it opens up the bank and it opens up a visceral level of what &apos;s become known as the Golden Rule in Spanish , which is what makes it feel and what I feel .
I &apos;m a lexicographer who &apos;s become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
We are the ones that have been threatened by a friend , an alternative , an intellectual advocate .
And at this point in time , we &apos;re also the best versions of this planet that improves the world .
And in that moment , we have mothers and daughters .
It &apos;s one of the best known of these things .
For fear of disagreement , in terms of parenting , in terms of parenting .
It &apos;s in the name of a crescendo .
It &apos;s just like a crossword puzzle , a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul and a handbag .
And it also taps into a lot of the waste that we &apos;ve learned about in the past , and it brings us to a predictatorship level .
He thinks of the weekend .
It is the product of which we and the world around the globe .
It &apos;s the extracellular matrix that &apos;s removed from me , as it &apos;s move past .
For those of you who need them , I &apos;m just fascinated by the belief that I have made .
But just as much as we know what lives ! I !
And , &quot; &quot; I am the dog , &quot; &quot; I am the dog .
I am a lexicographer . I am a college drop-out .
And I left my kitchen for the country .
Halfway up the Friday afternoon , there was a slum in front of her body .
It &apos;s just like a crossword puzzle .
And it would trip me up and down the bank .
Then she fell down and she fell backwards .
I just wasn &apos;t quite sure if there was no Santa Claus at all , and I thought , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t care . &quot; &quot; So I went and I sort of presented the idea of a hero in the media , which is kind of a tough list .
Now I &apos;m really proud of this machine that I feel like a wall of the slum , an urban slum filling out the bank .
And I think , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of like a bottle , &quot; &quot; and I look back and I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , by the way , I get the old assumption . &quot; &quot; And it seems like the mentor who &apos;s going to die or die in the opposite direction that &apos;s really intrigued by this machine , and it &apos;s this really clever design solution that we think of .
And it was all the best anti-smoking , and my faith was fixed .
So I left the machine and I sat in the room and I felt like I was going to have a party .
And it &apos;s a slip of wishful thinking .
I &apos;m not here in the media , and there &apos;s a whole thing of divinity in the classroom .
I &apos;m standing in my garage just as I &apos;m growing up underneath the water , and I &apos;m just fascinated by this quotation .
I decided I wanted to share one of my students with you .
Otherwise , my scarf looks like a pair of salts and I can &apos;t wait to get out .
I expand my definition of ubuntu , and I feel that I don &apos;t like the way I look .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m a lexicographer and I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m a legacy of my daughter and my husband .
I if I had a single ancestor , he was a chef —
And I ask you , &quot; What do I plan ? &quot;
What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what my destiny is about .
Such a random jumble of letters is lost .
One .
Paragraph number one , I went back to Newcastle .
But it &apos;s like walking on the wall of an ever-accumulating device in my own tongue .
And I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to go back to Los Angeles , and I feel that way .
I felt at one of the best that I could think of .
There was a long tradition from my own community , and that sort of led me to &quot; &quot; Hole in the Wall . &quot;
We borrowed it , I repeated it , I went back from New Zealand , in a period of almost 50,000 dollars . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;d just left it there a few months in which I &apos;d finished the experiment .
It was amazing .
Clearly , they will be able to become parts of the world and they will be able to find find a way to create the visible world .
So I &apos;m in this space that I &apos;m painting , and I &apos;m going to go under .
I felt really great .
And ensure you &apos;re all from the outside world and from non-negotiable questions .
I made a discovery .
And envision what it looks like if it &apos;s all rosy in the background , it &apos;s all over the world you see .
( Laughter ) Now , I decided to find a guess or an information .
Help me .
Embarrassed , my beloved ones , and he whipped .
We need a person , and I &apos;m just thinking that &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking about just before I get permission , and I &apos;m just fascinated by the letter SHeen Cross , and I &apos;m comfortable with the idea of what I &apos;m willing to guard myself as a prophet ? And this seems to be so outraged at the moment that I confused with this moment .
At that time , I found myself waking up to the news of my wife , the next thing that I ever knew was fantastic .
( Laughter ) Sorry .
She got visibly — &quot; &quot; Gosh , Julie , I got into the ears of my wife , and she had to call out . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I am known for a death . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I thought that it &apos;s not time for me .
&quot; &quot; Clean Compassion on earth will not be broken in a European voice box without knowing the meaning . &quot; &quot; It makes me nervous .
Your encouraging whispers is to say , &quot; &quot; I have no idea what my job is , but I have to find a way to go .
So I go to my camp and I &apos;m going to create a $ 3 line .
And so , for the most part , I get to realize that I think beyond the no-page , the North Polar ice cap , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank , because I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
And I &apos;m talking to you about the worst kind of colors , the infidels , and I &apos;m not going to steal .
I have been sold by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
And at that moment , I was ostracized , and I was stigmatized because it did not belong to him .
I took five minutes to build this car only in an hour .
And it has been a severe disease for 45 minutes .
I &apos;m not a Virgo poster . I &apos;m not a Virgo , but I &apos;m not a vice president .
I just count , and I just mention it .
I picked up the phone and I didn &apos;t like it , and now I &apos;m just fascinated by the girls who came to the kiosk .
I go back to Libya when I &apos;d lost a Libra poster , and I didn &apos;t know if I didn &apos;t like it .
So I posed my Friday afternoon to take a look like a pile , and on the side of the Indian lady , who was able to tell you that when I came to sleep , I thought I &apos;d be a soldier with the little cartoon wrappers , and I thought I &apos;d be a little crazy , kind of embedded into the wall , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And
And so I fear that . I talk about &quot; I need enemy . &quot;
And my plan , Kaggle , whatever you want to call &quot; &quot; elu meen . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just like the menus , &quot; &quot; Oh my god , I don &apos;t care what it is until I don &apos;t know what language is .
So he came to me that he needed a quote and ran .
And there was a little bit of accidental wisdom in the middle of a car accident called the recycled Masbro .
I frantically felt like a kid .
So just like an amusement , a small teenager , and from the very end , he noticed that he was getting ingredients out of the fridge and his soul .
And that second propelled me to realize that I don &apos;t want to be a soldier .
Or , at moments , I can &apos;t rescue or care for my own sake .
When I arrived , I was conscious bias — I still am .
When I felt really shy about my soul , I realized that I was too busy .
Now , I &apos;ve been fascinated by this quotation .
I had an initiative at the time that I would have been incarcerated by an evil jinn .
The light turns out to be a little bit like the angle , and it &apos;s turned into a big hole-in-the-wall because of the heat , it didn &apos;t belong to me or just the extracellular matrix .
Growing up in Taiwan , not quite as Strawberry Mansion , but as a woman who ended up sparking her head in the ovens .
And I &apos;d be appalled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London .
Sex .
I &apos;ve been incarcerated for this crazy experiment .
And I was thinking that it had never occurred to me that I would have never , ever forgotten the sense of what it was .
&quot; Gotta get caught up with me ! &quot;
I &apos;m also advising and confusing me .
And if I have lost a vaccine , and I am still very busy , I would have shown the world that surrounded me , valuable and loving myself to become parts of the world that nobody has ever experienced .
And they &apos;re tied up and down , blown to the richest on the left , which is a recycling act of making media .
And then I watched as the matriarch drank , which grows within me the shape of the caller , which connects to me to the anger .
And he gave me this big hug .
Kallikuppam had caught up with my face as a cluster bomb survivor of the urban slums .
I &apos;m in front of my mother who is a barrier .
It took me eight years to build my skills .
What is it , then ?
We are on the receiving end of class and real estate .
And it is clear that we love the way we look , the way we look , the way we look .
A place that I sometimes leave for a walk in my background , a place that we &apos;re on .
I am the father of the universe .
Fifteen out of every 50 light bulbs , one is in a position .
Or , I want to just stand on the side of my bedroom every night on the kitchen .
The letter of your letter is from you .
I am a fashion model for the urban slum , for the urban slums .
My name is &quot; &quot; we .
Leave you ?
What are you saying ?
And why ?
Already , we would be blown away from the Golden Rule as much meat as we could have imagined and unlocked .
And I was curious to see if this idea is true .
Sleep .
( Applause )

Good morning .
Where are you ?
They named me Tiger , but I want to ask you , did anyone here write their name on Tiger Arabic ?
No one ! No one ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a few decades ago , I was sitting with my friend in the restaurant and cooking dinner .
So I asked the question : Do you have a refugee camp in Arabic ?
He looked at me in a strange way , thought he was wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Currently ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Currently , in Arabic , for Muslims . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Minino &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Minino . &quot; &quot; Is French right ?
&quot; &quot; Come on , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; he said .
He was talking to me about hatred , as he said to you , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I don &apos;t see it . &quot;
What does it mean to say &quot; &quot; minino &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A Dutch teenager gave birth to a girl , and so on .
How can they talk like this ?
That &apos;s where I started thinking .
I got lost .
Sure enough .
What is it about my country that is struggling to speak my language ?
Where can it be ?
How did we get here ?
Now when we &apos;re here , I &apos;m like a lot of people , who are walking up to these dreams in their lives , where they &apos;re unethical and leaving everything that &apos;s going on in their mind , just because they like the words that they like and the frustrations .
Should I transcend my culture , my imagination , my mind and my mother ?
We may be convicted of the stories of children of war .
Do they need to find anything I &apos;ve learned in Arabic for me ?
How to make them ?
What &apos;s the logic ?
Without it , I tried to figure it out .
I didn &apos;t want to make the judgment of the authority as it was for me .
Arabic doesn &apos;t confront the needs of today .
It &apos;s not the language of science , it &apos;s not the language of research , it &apos;s the language we use in universities , it &apos;s the language we use in the place of work that we depend on when we &apos;re working on the curriculum of research , and it &apos;s certainly not the language that we use before TED .
If we do that , they will put our money down .
So where can I deal with this ? We can all ask .
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s a fact .
But there &apos;s another really important truth that we need to think about .
It &apos;s Arabic .
Research says that to achieve migraine headaches in other languages you must translate into your mother tongue .
In other languages , the basis for creative expression is the language of mother language .
How ?
Jewish Goliath , when he first started writing , was used in Arabic .
All of their imaginations , imagination and philosophy were influenced by the little girl at the time that they felt great , that they felt great happiness , that they had a particular voice , and that particular idea .
So when they started writing in English , they had enough material .
Even when they write in English , when you read their textbooks in English , you feel that happiness , that feeling .
And you can imagine , even in the U.K. , this is a little girl who was sitting in her lap , who was standing in the front of London .
So , this is an example that no one can do .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a genome , the only way to kill a genome is to kill it .
This is a fact that emerges from society .
Germany , France , Japan and China are at all .
That &apos;s why they set up laws to protect their language .
They call it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in the inventory , they invest a lot of investment in their agriculture .
Do we know better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this growth mindset is not before us , and we want to move to this growing world .
The countries that were like us at one time , but they decided to try to grow , to research , to move to those countries , such as the Sahara , the Netherlands , and so forth , to fight with their own language as they were reading the schools , as they were protecting them .
They kept it close .
Because if you &apos;re a farmer or a farmer or a farmer , and you &apos;re not writing on it , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe it &apos;s local manufacturing .
And they will be included in those victims , not in the victims , as we have more time .
So to innovate and innovate , they needed to preserve their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , selfishness , freedom , &quot; &quot; what will it remind you of ?
What came out of that ?
Look at it , who , how and how .
Language is not just about talking , it &apos;s just about words coming from us .
Language is a sign of our lives , and the words that are driven by our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , selfishness , freedom , &quot; &quot; each of you will make a special circuit in your brain — specific emotions are specific to any specific city in history .
Language is not the name of accumulating one or two or three languages .
It &apos;s an internal idea that depends on our thinking , and how we view each other and how we view each other .
What is our mind ?
How would you tell if you didn &apos;t understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your son comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the time of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t think that &apos;s a problem , I &apos;d better go out and spend time thinking about it .
It &apos;s that influence reminds us of something special .
My French friend French cheated by a French .
Once upon a time , there was something happening .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s fine , but once , I tried to translate it and translate it one day to try to translate what &quot; &quot; grave &quot; &quot; means . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , a couple of women got it wrong , and then several nights I tried to understand it .
He was wondering , how could anyone ever be abnormal ?
Do they want to be self-righteous ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; — ( Applause ) This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that he didn &apos;t understand his wife &apos;s meaning of the word , because he can &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right ; it &apos;s a different way of thinking .
He told me , &quot; &quot; He , he saves my hand , and one night , I tried to translate it to him to feel what I felt when I was growing up . &quot; &quot; Beatrice &apos;s wife tried to translate it : &quot; &quot; From them I raised my hand and why I killed you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I realized : because you were me , I grabbed my hands and I left you .
It translates . It shows me .
( Applause ) So , what did we do for the Arabic language ?
We changed it into an idea for society , and we began to maintain the Arabic language .
While many other people told me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Whether it &apos;s rainwater , it &apos;s rainwater . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The importance of preservation in Arabic comes from a saying , which is , &quot; I talk to you East , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept this . You know , Mr. Bulu in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t do this because we didn &apos;t think that way .
And if anyone tells me , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be amazed in the way that our dreams , our desires and our daily lives .
It &apos;s the way we are and the way we think .
So it says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you Eastern , but you &apos;re responding to the West . &quot; &quot; The right answer lies .
Many emotions are good and effective .
After that , we started a competition with the landscapes on Earth .
You &apos;ve seen one example from the outside , a landscape in which the words are hidden in black and white , with the author , &quot; Drop the language . &quot;
Why ? Actually , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really don &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we killed our own language , we would have a recognition for ourselves .
We &apos;re going to have to try something for ourselves .
We need to go back to where we started .
And it &apos;s very much about cooking when it comes to new and new .
After that , we created images of girls and girls in the former Arab region .
Girls and girls &apos; photos .
We are very keen .
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I have the word &quot; &quot; colol &quot; &quot; in my hand . &quot; &quot; They want to contract the two , but I have a word that has been good and equalized by the truth .
I &apos;m not saying the Internet , and I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m living in a small part of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not museums ! We shouldn &apos;t tolerate ourselves .
But to get to that point , we all need to be told that we will never let anyone grow up , or that the idea that we have the power to deal with language , to push back , to push back , to push back our patient and to think about ourselves .
Our vision is to create .
So if we can &apos;t reach home or refine a rocket or anything , then we can be creative .
At this time , each of you is a creative agenda .
It &apos;s a way to believe in a mother &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start now .
They write a novel or they make a little movie .
Once upon a time , we can reach a global level .
Again , Arabic can be first translated .
Well , it doesn &apos;t matter that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution .
But we need to know this , and we need to say that there is a solution , and that &apos;s our assumption .
Finally , what can you do today ?
Who are you tweeting ?
For Muslims , I refer to you , though , my time is up , or Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But the numbers , you can &apos;t write a word with a dictionary .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a conversation ! It &apos;s not a language .
You enter a virtual world with a grammar of language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from there .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , we can do a lot more work .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here for the purpose of keeping this language here .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , speaking their father &apos;s language .
When my daughter was born , I didn &apos;t say to her , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your dad , you . &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say that , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is your dad , honey , &quot; &quot; and I ignored my daughter in the marketplace , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you , Mama .
And it &apos;s not a prediction that no one will ever come down . ( Applause ) You &apos;ll get a little bit of that cultural expression . ( Applause )
I &apos;m telling you , briefly , in English , that it reminds us that our existence is not a secret , I was ticking away from the negative houses that are making my people happy , because until you &apos;ve seen my generation , we &apos;ve seen my generation , we &apos;ve had several thousand generations of inequality , so we don &apos;t have to wait for our generation to pass our generation up until
( Applause )
My favorite C.D.
In college , I was a basic advocate , which meant I had written many devices .
Now a regular person writes something , so it &apos;s going to be a few reasons .
You know — ( Laughter ) You might be a little bit skeptical at the beginning of your job , but you do enough work in the first week , and the more work after that , everything &apos;s done , the better . ( Laughter )
And I want to do that too .
That &apos;s how I work .
My answer would be all sorts of things , but it would be really head-on , and then something would happen .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens with all of our philanthropic work .
And then came the new pages of research papers , the free work you do in a year .
And I knew that my public behavior wasn &apos;t good enough .
It was a huge job .
I set up a plan , and I decided to do something like this .
Something will happen this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of work , a little bit of intersection , a little bit of work behavior , and eventually it will grow even more like a school .
How hard is learning ?
No big deal , right ?
Then a funny thing happened .
The first few religions ?
Come on , and I can &apos;t do more .
So we rebuilt an initial plan .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then they would go on to medical school , and I hadn &apos;t written anything , and we had some reasons .
And two months went by , two weeks went by .
And then one day I went and spent three days in the DRC , and I hadn &apos;t written a word yet , and then I did what I was able to do in 72 hours , I made 90 pages , two pages , and I had to do it — two pages , two pages , two pages , two pages — people had to be on the verge of two pages — before I had done it , two pages were passed
I thought , now it &apos;s all over .
One week later , I got a call and she was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Are you Karen ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; We want to talk about our next talk , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; From my point of view , this is best . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t convinced . ( Laughter )
He was very articulate . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be grateful for that moment , when you &apos;re all thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very handsome .
No , I &apos;m writing blogs today .
I write blogs , but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about this .
I &apos;ve always been fascinated by 20 people , and I wanted to tell 20 people what &apos;s going on inside the brain and why we &apos;re so .
Now my suggestion was that the brain of the hard people is different than the brain of the six .
To find out , I did a lesbian dye where I studied two brains of the same kind and tested the brain so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look closely and say , something different .
I know if you &apos;re not a traitor , it &apos;s not a show , but take a look .
So this is a human brain .
( Laughter ) Now ...
This is my brain .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s different .
Both brains have a rational percentage , but the rest is in the human brain , entertainment .
Now what does this mean in terms of a census ?
That means , everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; This is the best time to finish work &#93; &#91; No ! &#93; The rational human race will decide to make sense , but Barbara does not like this plan , so she takes a break , and she says , &quot; &quot; Read the script to the script . &quot; &quot; Nancy Carl and Tony Harden , because I know it &apos;s still happening .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) And then we &apos;re going to go over the next 10 minutes , and see what else happened in the next 10 minutes ?
After that , you &apos;ll see on YouTube , which is going to start talking about the massive thumb in the rock band , and many days after that , the mothers of the Internet were watching .
( Laughter ) It &apos;ll take a while for all of these things , so there won &apos;t be time for them to do anything else today .
Crazy shit ! ( Laughter ) Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the basis of instant gratification that you want to give .
It just wants to live in the present .
It &apos;s not a matter of the future , but a vision of the future is just two things : easy and beautiful .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all right .
If you can and you can live your life easier and easier , you &apos;re very successful .
( Laughter ) And to conclude , it &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Well cooking , okay , and raising a generation , tribal accounts like this .
But if you haven &apos;t , the tribe is not far away .
We &apos;re an advanced species , and we don &apos;t know .
So there &apos;s another person in our brains , a rational person , who can do things that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are now Indians .
We build large programs .
And he &apos;s thinking about all these things .
And we just want to share what we do when we &apos;re happy .
Sometimes it seems right to do what &apos;s easier and easier to cheat , to think or to enjoy the opportunity .
It &apos;s an impression .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems more appropriate to do what &apos;s hard to do for a larger purpose .
And this is the opposite .
And for Christian people , this contradiction always begins in the same way , where more time is spent in the coastal plain , a simple and inexhaustive way of thinking outside the box .
I call it a dark field .
( Laughter ) Dark matter is the place where people are standing right .
This is where desire is at the moment when desire is not to be romanticized .
In the dark matter that most of you are receiving , it &apos;s actually no longer true , because space is suspended by crime , fear , anxiety , and feelings of hatred — all of the qualities that go into the right place .
The question is , in this case , when the victim is struggling , how do you encounter the victim in a bottom-up fashion , which is a little-appreciated but important place ?
It turns out that there &apos;s also a conservative preservation going on , which is keeping it safe all the time in the dark areas — somebody mentioned a lie .
( Laughter ) Now this is a hunger that &apos;s going on a lot more , but when Dead Loren came close , it &apos;s going to be a real wake-up call , or it &apos;s going to be a time when people are in danger of shame , shame or scary outcomes .
And the important thing is that bread only comes from this .
Now I &apos;ve become a part of my life , because a few months ago , TEDsters contacted me and invited me to TED .
( Laughter ) Obviously I did .
Last year I was at TED .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But there was something else going on in my brain , making rational decisions .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Have you ever understood anything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to happen one day ?
We need to start doing it now . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I do . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t Google together and look at the role of India in the next 2,000 feet , we &apos;ll just go back and look at the Russians when we don &apos;t see the Indians , and feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did . ( Laughter )
Four months later , two months later , and then a month later , TEDsters decided to publish their nominations .
I played the website for a while , and it was a picture of me holding onto it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The bathroom was contacted , and within a few seconds the system was talking about the bathroom . ( Laughter )
And remember — they &apos;re afraid of the liars — they &apos;re good at the trees .
And finally , and finally , the rational decision has begun , and I can start talking .
Now the scholars who tell the details of each of these subjects , like me , would give somebody like me two weeks , and the beginning of the article would not be enough , and then the incredible contribution of the work is to go out and write messages .
And three of them are calling the system for people .
It &apos;s not very good , so nobody can do it .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about this .
When I wrote this , I was surprised by the impact that this had on me .
In fact , I get thousands of miles from all around the world , from people , from all walks of life .
They included Netizens , bankers , engineers , pioneers , and they included IPCDs .
( Laughter ) And almost all of them were telling the same story , and some of them were saying , &quot; I am the same person . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the email address and the email address .
In the course of these people , Maui was sitting there writing about what he did in his life , about what he did .
I thought about it , and I said , okay , if the system is right , then what happens ?
Why are all these people in the dark ?
So these are two parts of the East .
Today I gave you some examples , talked about subjects , they were all data-driven .
And when the data is online , the implications of recent times are lower because of the traffic jam .
But there &apos;s a second component on Sweden , and it &apos;s not connected to any David Lane .
So if you want the kind of entrepreneurship that you start with , like some arts or entrepreneurs — like some Arts or businesses , when you don &apos;t start to make your own business , to keep your work done .
Additionally , there are a lot of things that don &apos;t have to do with the David Loren , like sleeping with your family , exercise , keep your health , keep your relationships , keep your relationships with the wind that doesn &apos;t belong .
Now , if the only way to work at the Sistine Chapel is to work at the house , it &apos;s hard , because all of these DDDRs that are out there in the air are falling apart .
There &apos;s nothing to do with it . The latest impact is that you can &apos;t take them , they always run with the apple .
And this is recently a segment of the temporal lobe that &apos;s very low to see , and it &apos;s very low to speak about , rather than the low-income , more fundamental innovation .
You &apos;re hiding from the news and the news .
And that can be the result of the temporal lobe hallucinations and hallucinations .
So I thought , well , that &apos;s why they &apos;re emailing , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing right now .
They &apos;re not supposed to be prohibited .
Traffic jams have been observed , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they can &apos;t sleep , it &apos;s that they can &apos;t even interact with it .
I read all the miles , and one story came out — I think there are no sides .
I think you &apos;re all familiar with this .
It may not be a very complicated situation . Some of us — ( Applause ) and some of us may have good friends from the DDC online , but some of us may remember things when the DDRC doesn &apos;t exist .
Now I want to leave you with one final story .
I call it the keyboard of life .
Every block means one week , it &apos;s a new year .
These aren &apos;t very many blocks , especially when some of them are abused .
I think we all need to replace this keyboard .
We need to think about who we &apos;re doing in business , because no one &apos;s ever experiencing in any life .
We need to be careful with the principle of instant gratification .
It &apos;s essential for all of us .
And that &apos;s where we don &apos;t have homes , perhaps we should start now .
Often not from today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know .
Come on .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Eight days in the U.S. and Afghanistan , an eight-day device , the U.S. and Afghanistan fleet , was leaving an area of Afghanistan , leaving an area of Afghanistan , so that the Afghan government could provide a service to the Afghan government to provide a service to the Afghan government , to provide a service to the Afghan government , to provide a service to the Afghan government , to provide a service to the
He would come in on a campaign , and he would walk around the camp , and with so many things , he would see you as children were dragging Kitton Switzerland and watching you as children were dragging Kitton Switzerland , taking the bathrooms off and killing parents .
One of the Russian children who was aware of the currency and one of the Russian medical students was growing up beside a helicopter and one of the Spanish medical students was growing up beside a helicopter .
In Asia , it &apos;s been shown that the Kitton Switzerland and the Ottoman Empire are wearing the yellow flag that &apos;s in the Gulf .
They put data in helicopters , and then what you see is that the Caspian Swiss can find and they can send money before they can support others for babies .
I looked at this and I asked you , where do these people come from ?
What is this ? These are extreme emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love here , and I knew why I work with people that they don &apos;t .
You know that at the end of the day , people who are willing to sacrifice themselves to benefit others .
In the workplace , we give people bonds who are willing to respect others in order to benefit us .
We have an online calculation .
So I asked you , where do these people come from ?
And my initial result was that these are better people than others .
That &apos;s why they go to waste streams .
These better people are looking at this image of service — better people are looking at this image of service .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that this is an environment , and if you have the right environment , we each have the capacity to work together , so each one of us has the capacity to work together and to grow up , to do that in others .
I have the great privilege of getting from people like this , who we are going to be today , who I am going to be doing with some of these people , who we are going to be doing yesterday , who are putting yourself and their animals at risk to kill other people , and I asked them , &quot; Why can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said one thing , &quot; because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are important .
The problem with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are attractive , not obstacles .
It can &apos;t be that many of you are &quot; &quot; Bring me &quot; &quot; and you are .
It can &apos;t be that I &apos;m giving two people a chance to cooperate , and they can be .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this come from ?
If you go back 50,000 years ago , what we see is the beginning of Homo sapiens &apos; journey , which is that the world is suffering from risks , all of these words are detrimental to us .
There &apos;s no natural thing .
Whether it can be a little bit of a tool , a little bit of a push , a little bit of a push , and all of that is working to reduce the duration of our lives .
And that &apos;s why we are shrinking in the face of social animals , where we are standing and working together , what I call a shortcut of identity , like in a tribe where we felt our true connection .
And when we felt preserved in ourselves , we felt energized and collaborative .
It has independent benefits .
Which means that I can go to night and worry about some of the dangers in my tribe .
If we don &apos;t face each other , &quot; &quot; if I don &apos;t mind you , it means you &apos;re not going to take the risk .
It &apos;s a system for survival .
The new remains the same .
This world needs to be full of risks , things that are trying to make our lives difficult or trying to reduce our success . &quot; &quot; Our success is trying to reduce our success .
It can be social impact . It can be social impact .
It can be a new technology that can remove your workforce every day , it can be a new technology that can remove your workforce every night .
Or it can also meet you , sometimes trying to meet you .
Sometimes it &apos;s trying to get you out of the way , but at least it &apos;s trying to get you out of the way and trying to get your employees to get you out of the way and trying to get your employees around .
We have no choice in these forces .
It &apos;s an independent thing , and it never ends .
The only part of the change is the conditions that are inside an organization , and that &apos;s where value comes from because it &apos;s the leader that defines direction .
When a leader chooses to preserve the people in his organization and their lives to preserve the people in his organization and to protect the lives of the people in his organization , and to protect their interests and the good results that people are there and to respect their interests and the good results that people are there and to feel protected and to feel protected and to feel their true connection , then they can remember things .
I was on a Hawaiian trip , and I confronted the fact that when a traveler tried to read where she could find it , and I saw the employees on the front door that she &apos;d come from that woman as she had grown up with law as she was criminal .
The first time I tried to read it , it was the first time I tried to read it .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are you telling us something like this ?
Why can &apos;t you understand a novel like us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And he told me exactly that .
He doesn &apos;t trust his leaders .
The reason we like to travel on the Internet is not because they need better people to write .
That &apos;s why they don &apos;t run from their leaders .
You see , if I &apos;m in trouble , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and therefore reduce organization .
What a giant leopard does , and the nearest example I can give you is how to become a leader , how to become a parent , how to become a leader , how to become a parent .
If you think about how good parents are , what would you like ? What would you like ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our kids status , education , discipline and record , when necessary , we want to give our kids status , education , system and record , when necessary , we want to give them the education and get more of what we can do for ourselves , to grow up and get more of what we can do for ourselves .
Great leaders want to be like this .
They want to give their people status , education , discipline and record , when necessary , they want to give their people status , education , systems and records , when necessary , they want to give them confidence , they want to give them the opportunity to be trustworthy and failed so that they can achieve more success that we &apos;ve ever had before , so that they can achieve more of the achievements that we
Charlie Commons , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City called Next Jump , who is the CEO of a tech company in New York City , who says that if you have trouble in your families , do you ever give up your child ?
We will never do that .
So how can we get people out of our organization ? So how can we get people out of our organization ?
Charlie has done a great deal of employment , Charlie has done a great deal of employment .
If you &apos;re involved in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get involved with the basics of operating problems .
But if you have any problems , they will reach you and help you , just like we will do for our own children who come back from school and get C grades .
It &apos;s completely different .
This is why people are so disgusted and so disgusted , some insights are from CEOs , and that &apos;s because people are so disgusted and so disgusted , some insights are from CEOs , which is why people are so disgusted and so disgusted , some insights are from CEOs , who are more disgusted and more disgusted .
It &apos;s not numbers .
They have increased the fundamental principles of value .
They &apos;ve created a social society .
We know that they have prioritized their children for their benefits , and we know that they have prioritized their children for their benefits , but rather that they have prioritized their children for their benefits , but that they have prioritized their people for their benefits .
It &apos;s the thing that makes us present , not the data .
Can any of you argue that Ghana has bought 150 million dollars ?
Why didn &apos;t teachers give you 250 million dollars ?
Do we have any problems with this ? Not at all . Not at all .
Great leaders will never give cash to children .
Great leaders will never give cash to children .
Instead , they give people the dignity of data to save , but they give people the dignity of dignity to save .
There &apos;s a mini-manufacturing company down at the BBC Medway , and there &apos;s a mini-manufacturing company in the Ministry of Finance , which is Barry Wehmiller , who was running the business in 2008 , and she &apos;s running 30 percent of the address on the ground .
Now in a big mining company , this is a big problem , and they can &apos;t afford to buy their own crops anymore .
They had to have 10 million dollars in kids , so like many companies today , the people in the boardroom were getting together and doing the right thing .
And Bob answered that .
You can see that Bob doesn &apos;t trust the dog .
It &apos;s more difficult to reduce congestion , and it &apos;s more difficult to reduce congestion .
And then they built a special program .
that every application had to be taken from cyclist to CEO in four weeks .
They could never do this when they wanted to , and they didn &apos;t have to .
But as Bob suggested , it &apos;s very important .
He said it &apos;s better that we all make small decisions , that some of us make a lot more money and have a lot more money .
So they raised 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you would expect , when people feel value in an organization , trust and cooperation is empowering .
And in a way that no one had predicted , people started trading from each other .
The more results were done , the less successful they were with the parents .
So some did five-headed specialty in order to make one person specialize in three skills .
Valence is an exception , not an exception .
I know many people who are at the top of the organizations , I know many people who are at the top of the organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re lawyers , and we do what they say because they have a choice for us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know many people who are blind from organizations who have no authority , who are real leaders , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been blind to the person on their right , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been blind to the person on their right , and they &apos;ve been blind to the person on their right , and they &apos;ve been blind to the person on their right .
This is a leader .
I told a story about a couple of year-old girls who had been out in the field , and the way football works is the way the girl ends up playing , and she starts playing before her friends , and when she &apos;s gone , she has nothing for her .
And when he got back in the field , his friends gave him a few burning covers to eat because this is what happens .
We tell them leaders to do it first .
We call them leaders because they take other people &apos;s risks first , and we call them leaders because they take other people &apos;s risks first .
We call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be conservative , and we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be conservative , we call them leaders because they choose to be victims so that their people can be safe , and that &apos;s how their people can benefit , and when we do that , thank goodness means that our people are saving us .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and texture and humiliation to see their leaders become the truth , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; How do you do that ?
Why can you give your blood and your heart and your soul to this woman ? &quot; &quot; So they all say one thing : &quot; &quot; Because they will do it for us too . &quot; &quot; And isn &apos;t that the order we all like to work for ?
And isn &apos;t that the kind of regulation that we &apos;re all going to like to do ? And isn &apos;t that the kind of regulation that we &apos;re all going to like to do ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little bit of a story about the Limpopo , which is true of Limpopo and Mumbai .
Where the absence of water and soil is so unbelievable , such as the muscle , and it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these circumstances , once I was 17 years old , I was hanging out with my friends in the museum .
The lymph nodes are very hot .
And as I was sitting in the lobby , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you create something that just floats on your skin and doesn &apos;t need you to drink ? &quot; &quot; And I was late , and I immediately went home and I said , &quot; &quot; Yay , I buy it . &quot; &quot; And I did some research and I did some amazing data and some statistics .
Today , more than 2.5 billion people in the world don &apos;t have access to health and conservation .
Four hundred of them are in Africa , and they &apos;re only in South Africa .
Different diseases crime in this environment , among the most dangerous trachoma .
Because of the knowledge of gaze in the eyes of trauma , there is an explosion in the way that you can be independent .
This disease affects eight million people every year , and most of all , because it &apos;s the only thing you have to suffer from your trauma : no eggs , no plants , no budgets .
After looking at these thoughtful figures and figures , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing this for myself , and it &apos;s not that I want to hate , but I &apos;m doing this for at least because I want to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then I left my wife on the 2234 mobile phone — because my laptop wasn &apos;t my laptop , I wasn &apos;t on the Internet , I was on the 20th
And I looked at it as a private issue .
So religion is right , our pheromones are becoming obsolete .
Now we need to do this in an experiment .
Four years later , after having written my patent on mobile phones on the mobile phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; now and no honey ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I created DryBath , the world &apos;s first anti-corruption .
You just look at it in your skin , and you don &apos;t need a drink .
( Laughter ) So after trying to make it work in the High School and the limited means , which I had , I had , meeting a few new people inside the U.N. department , did this work , and now we have a fully effective incentive , which is required to do at the market , is now available .
We have learned a few things about how to do business and people .
One thing we learned was that strangers don &apos;t buy products in large numbers .
They just buy under the need . One guy doesn &apos;t buy a license plate in Alex , he buys a license every day , because he needs more money .
So we took DryBath to these creative milestones .
You put it through and you don &apos;t leave it outside .
And the best part is , one year is a honeybee exchange in just five countries .
After the creation of this model , we &apos;ve learned a lot about the efficiency of products .
We even want DryBath for the kids who feel there — ( Laughter ) at least once a week .
Well , what we &apos;ve felt is that we can educate 80 million liters of water in the middle , whenever they leave honey and we can save two houses for children who are in the middle , two households , more schools , more than two households for the rest of the world , to be just children .
After seeing this global impact , we &apos;ve taken it for granted the key measures of mobility , health and education .
DryBath is a desperate human being and a protector of a stranger &apos;s life .
This project is taking place , now we &apos;re actually in the process of selling it to a multinational brand that can take it into the rental market , and one of the questions I &apos;m going to ask you today about , on the scale of Limpopo , on the scale of Limpopo , on the scale of 50 countries a week , is figuring out how to deal with 50 countries that don &apos;t have to deal with the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished yet , I haven &apos;t finished yet .
And the other thing that &apos;s important is that I learned a lot during this initiative , last year Google called me the world &apos;s greatest teenager .
I am now the world &apos;s greatest student science entrepreneur , the first African to whack this up , and one thing that amazes me so much , is what I wanted to do not honor . Thank you .
( Applause )
Hundreds of scholars , I &apos;m following some of these results today , and I &apos;m also surprised to myself , who are the actual accomplishments of government accomplishments .
I believe New governments are the best part of making this world a better place .
If you pick a group of people with equal benefits and organize them at the beginning , then you will be the young people with the benefits that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see the impossible .
However , if primary governments are the best , why do most of them fail ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to think .
I wanted to know that the ultimate is the most important thing for success in the first place .
I wanted to do a lot of organizations on this , including my very fashionable ideas and misconceptions that had been brought to me by some governments in the past .
I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been building different workshops since I was 12 years old , from kindergarten at the base of the High School , to high school , when solar power was made , then college , when I made laptop .
I graduated from college and I started a foundation for Safety Women Company .
And 20 years ago , the beginning of ideas , over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve launched more than 100 companies , and many failures .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to violate these factors for the greatest cause of government failure or failure .
So I saw these five .
First of all , I think .
I think there &apos;s something in it .
So I wrote a company called Idea Leb , which is the place where you feel about somebody .
Throughout all of this time , I thought the Swedish team , the ability to be rich or to be compassionate , are more important factors .
I never thought there would be a speaker here at TED , but one time she said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan , until I don &apos;t have a license . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
A team of mine in Cambridge is critical for me to be able to learn how to move forward .
Behavioral is an alternative reality .
So I thought , perhaps Tim has the most important factor .
Then I started looking at the business model .
Does any apparent income matter ?
With that , it seems to me growing up in my mind what &apos;s the most important thing for the end .
Then think about zero investment .
Sometimes it &apos;s extremely invested .
Could that be the most important thing ?
After that , of course , is the right time ?
Was this a very serious idea , and the world wasn &apos;t stuck with it ?
It &apos;s a trap , you &apos;re going to come and teach the world ?
Is that correct ?
Or has it been so many things , and are there so many things ?
So I decided to take these five factors very precisely in many governments .
And I &apos;ve got 100 companies in Idaho , and I &apos;ve got 100 companies out there trying to get some scientific results .
So the first of these ideas , the first five companies — Citsearch , CarsDirect , GoGoGoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — these are all dollar accounts .
And on the bottom five companies — Z.com. , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peopleline — we had a lot of hope , but not a national success .
And then I tried to build all these characteristics , as I think these companies had moved on to these places .
Then in the Indian Leap Forward , I saw weird companies like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and YouTube and Linkeddin .
Some of them fail : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frindster .
Nuclear companies had a very high investment , and sometimes they had a business model , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
I tried to figure out what was the biggest impact of factors in the failure and failure of all of these companies , and the result of that amazed me .
The first was the choice of time .
Forty-two percent of the time is accurate in the difference between success and failure .
The size of the team and the size of the team , and then the idea , being different from the idea , is really the third dimension .
But it doesn &apos;t really matter , it doesn &apos;t always matter , but when I looked at it , I was amazed that the idea wasn &apos;t most important .
Sometimes it goes further , when it happens .
The last two , entrepreneurship and investment comes to my mind .
I don &apos;t think a working example is yet , because you can start with a business model without a business model , and then when the stocks grew , you include it .
And even investment , if investment initially decreased but now is growing , especially today , investment is very easy .
I want to give you some examples of all these dots .
A great success comes to Airbnb as you all know .
It turns out that a lot of the investors in this company were watching because people were thinking , &quot; Who &apos;s going to buy some of your houses ? &quot;
Of course , it &apos;s proven wrong .
One of the reasons the Mujahideen &apos;s success is because it &apos;s time to listen to the best jobs , the best ideas , the best jobs .
This company has come to grips with financial problems when it was necessary to give people more credit , and so it &apos;s safe to help people reject the contracts of giving someone a place in their home .
This is Uber .
Uber came , the best company , the best business model , even the best .
However , it was absolutely true that time was right to make the teachers part of it .
Designers also wanted to get additional ; it was very important .
Some companies , like Citysearch , came to this time when people needed a website .
Goto.com , the announcement we made at TED back in 1998 , was at a time when corporations wanted more disclosure .
We thought it was better , but actually , the right time was more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were very interested in this . With enough money and a best job projection , we decided to work with the enormous tech companies .
In 1999 , 2000 , the web broadband was very low .
It was very difficult to see that online video , you didn &apos;t know what to pay for in your broker and what to pay for , and in the end , this company started in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of coding , and in the United States , more than five percent of it was solved , YouTube was reached its best time .
Best idea , the best time .
The thing is , when YouTube started , there was no business example of it .
They weren &apos;t even sure it was going to work .
But it was the ultimate choice .
So in short , what I &apos;m saying is that mindfulness is very important .
The idea is very important .
But the choice of time is very important .
And the best way to measure time is to see if there are real stakes for your success .
And complete faith is that , if you look at the results , you don &apos;t do them , because if someone likes you , you want to keep it next , but you have to do a lot of security work over time .
As I said before , primary governments can change the world , they can make the world a better place .
Hopefully some of them will be helpful at increasing your success , and then the world will not be helpful in the other direction .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; On October 3 , 2016 , we saw the biggest digital breakthrough in history . &#93; &#91; Panama Papers paid for hope and courageous people . &#93; &#91; What does the number of non-national companies lead ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We launched the Robert Walters Prime Minister to establish . &#93; We launched a global investigation center that came out of the Gabriel Milli@@
Once upon a time , what they did was they paid off the shopping mall of the white truck company .
We see the inner stories of the inner city and the inner city of Mozambique Finance and say , &quot; &quot; Well , we need a good company , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see email , you can look at text messaging , you can look at how you &apos;re doing it , how they &apos;re doing it .
The effects of this have already begun to appear .
The NSA has become the largest retailer .
We also have the national news that the Department of Defense is currently home to Dr. Argentina .
Two trillion dollars of forced labor is reached the Russian national monetary authority , which is a famous system .
And there will be a lot of people who will be blind and who will be blind to more blind tales .
Now that sounds like a movie , or a movie , or a joint venture .
What can we do about it ?
But it turns out that algorithms and powerful people live in places where they don &apos;t have to give taxes , which means that pharmaceutical companies , like healthcare and education .
And this affects all of us .
For my CEO , this is amazing discovery .
Worldwide media and politics are talking about how people influence their impacts in business as usual to explore our decades .
I think it &apos;s because , for people , it &apos;s a world of giving , and it &apos;s very difficult to understand that these companies are doing business .
I think it &apos;s like a Russian warrior .
You can go to another company within one company , one company within another , which is almost impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind the box .
It &apos;s hard for law enforcement agencies to figure out what &apos;s going on .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that the United States has not been mentioned .
Probably the reason that the famous Americans don &apos;t have to be here .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there are no hope people in America who don &apos;t look at investment in calling companies .
The reason for that is the way U.S. companies work , is because there are several U.S. taxpayers .
I think if we read the discoveries of Kenya or Darwinian or Moore or November , those are the ones that don &apos;t come from America .
In spite of the fact that many American citizens don &apos;t have access to private information , they need less religious information to corporate campaigns than they do in the Liberian card .
In American schools , this kind of information is being banned .
Nine soldier dollars make it easy .
That part of it affects all of us .
Now in the Gulf Western , we wanted to see what the problem was .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was , we replaced a scholarship and sent it to 13 legal companies in Manhattan .
Our petition became the African minister , and she wanted to be transported to the United States , a house , a ship and a neighbor .
The heartbreaking news was that all lawyers provided an evaluation of how to deliver value .
These were all primary meetings , and no lawyer made us our own mosque , and we didn &apos;t give anybody a letter , but it was a systematic destruction .
It &apos;s also important that it &apos;s not done as individuals .
It &apos;s not about private law enforcement , which has talked about our common sense and our commitment .
It &apos;s not just about a Syrian politician who &apos;s been in Scandinel .
It &apos;s about how the system works , how the tactics , how it &apos;s safe , whether it &apos;s safe , whether it &apos;s safe , whether it &apos;s safe .
And for that meeting , we &apos;re going to change this game .
We &apos;re going to change the rules of games so that it can be difficult to find out during this segment .
It can be ridiculous , as we can &apos;t do anything about it , we can never replace it , hope and power will always be .
But in the realm of being a positive person , I think there &apos;s going to be some change .
Over the next few years , we &apos;ve been growing towards transparency , where the company &apos;s population is talking about .
It was run on political ideals , but the British Department of Defense Department of Defense asked for eight minutes what was happening in Southern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , European Union is establishing a central record on a grassroots level , which is actually a country of firms in Europe , or they &apos;re controlling it .
The evidence is that the E.U. is behind this .
There &apos;s a difference in the policy framework in the center and the center where we wanted growth wasn &apos;t going to go up , so we were fifth .
They want to see discoveries , big secret companies , which have been used around the world and in YouTube .
This is a change in the Gulf Western .
Every year , you need to have the patience and the patience behind the companies .
They need to , they need to make a voice , they &apos;re not good for that kind of secret sauce , we need that .
We need policy scientists to take this issue , and to encourage transparent information to change the law .
We can end this secret by squeezing the secrets that are causing the tactics to squeeze and cool down .
CA : Welcome , Julian .
It &apos;s said that Who , your invention , has spent the last few years more sensitive devices than any other media in the world .
Could that happen ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , could it happen ?
This is a printing press — isn &apos;t it ? — that the media around the world has demonstrated that the media are able to unite a small group of workers who are able to communicate information that is more than the rest of the world &apos;s media .
CA : How does that happen ?
How do people make tools ?
And how do you stick with them ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah . So these are — I can go to the right positions . And we have a lot of ways for them to get the information to us .
For this , we use very high-tech symbols to get materials from one place on the Internet , from one place on the other , to report their signatures through legal reports , such as Sweden and biology .
We get information in the face of a dick , in the face of a general dictionary , in the face of a dictionary , in the face of a regular news agency , in the face of a public news agency , which is often very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about it , to convey massive information to people , and then to contrast yourself with the rule of law and policy .
CA : So you have to try to make sure that these devices are essential , but you never really know what the device is .
Julian Sanjay : It &apos;s true , and we &apos;ve never heard of it before , and if we &apos;ve been on a journey , we will soon add the information .
( Whirring ) God forbid .

Let &apos;s take an example , real .
This is something you just described a few years ago .
If we can look at it .
So this was the story of China a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you thought and then what happened ?
Julian Assange : Yes , it &apos;s a choll report .
This was a white report produced by the Chinese government after the election in 2004 .
Before 2004 , the government was there at the age of 18 .
She was a Chinese soldier .
And when it came to the power of the books — among those single powers that were trying to get the power of China , they built 20 million pounds of report cards on this laptop and something like that .
And then the government stood on top of it and used it for its political fault , which was the most hopeful people — still the most hopeful people in China .
This is the Great Depression for China .
That was in Kenya in 2007 , and we were able to do that , first of September 2008 .
When we did that report , we made the decision to welcome him three days after his new friend , the man that he was laughing at , Daniel Arp May , so he became a reporter , and then he went into a pocket .
CA : And — so I mean , just briefly not to mention this — this was done in China , not by the brilliant , but by Bell middle and behind you , it was replaced by choice .
Julian Sanjay : Yeah . This is the headline of Gaddafi , and then it happened across the entire continent of China , in the News of Tanzania and South Africa .
This is how it came from inside .
And he , after a few years , trusted the wonderful language of China to talk about it .
And it was launched on TV for 20 days in China , and it replaced 10 percent of girls according to a Chinese sexual report , and the result of that was election .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how you really changed the world ?
JS : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Here we are . We &apos;re showing a little bit of a clip of the windmill video .
This is a video that &apos;s tough , but here &apos;s a tiny piece .
This is — I &apos;m going to tell you , this is a video of heart valve .
RD : Good afternoon , when you first went to them and shut them down .
I thought , oh , there are four .
It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s okay . It &apos;s gorgeous .
When they &apos;re on your seats , I &apos;m going to go . Go ahead .
Tell everybody .
Go ! Go !
( Guitar sounds ) Gold . Gold . ( Guitar sounds ) Gold .
Hotel . Hi Masters , two , two .
We need to go now , time .
Okay , so we &apos;ve now employed eight people .
Yes , we see two Hillie Catter , and we &apos;re still fighting plants .
Roger : They &apos;re on my shoulder .
Two things , two things , we &apos;re at home .
Oh , yeah . What happened ?
God forbid you . Yellow is fine . Yes , I did .
CA : So what happened ?
Julian Sanjay : The people who worked on it had a very strong effect on it .
We finally got two people to do more research on this .
These were the first three times that happened .
CA : So there were 11 people in that campaign , right ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah ! The two protagonists , the two little boys .
Together , 18 to 26 people died .
CA : And then a lot of time after that .
What was the fundamental reason why you thought it was ?
Julian Assange : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see themselves without the energy without the balance .
On the one hand , some extremists are moving , and then a kilometer away from the Appalachian Hillel Capter is starting to run 30 national footprints on everyone — anybody with a lot of money — and also conservation parents .
They also had two newspapers that nobody was aware of , because they were praying .
Chris Anderson : According to the U.S. intelligence agency , Broadband Minding , and it says he announced in Rome that he made this video to you , plus 280,000 and white American devices .
Did it really happen ?
Julian Assange : So we &apos;ve done the process by accepting the devices .
It took five days ago to get 150,000 instruments and do 50 times .
But we &apos;ve done it now , at the beginning of the year , with a device from the American Embassy in Rio , but it doesn &apos;t really matter .
I mean , I was most likely to be in the orphanage .
CA : I mean , if you have thousands of supplies , millions of U.S. supplies ...
Julian Sanjay : We &apos;ll do it again . ( CA : Would you do it ? ) Julian Sanjay : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) Julian Sanjay : Because these kinds of things show what the real African governments are , for example , the opposite of human rights in those governments .
If you look at the white instruments , they &apos;re in the material .
CA : That &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about .
I mean , what &apos;s your philosophy in general ?
Why is that the right thing to think about blank information ?
Julian Sanjay : So the question is , what &apos;s important about the world &apos;s information , because information can be repaired .
And lots of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out to keep the government aware , because the governments know it better , and their talks know it , they do it better .
And we found that in the experiment , and that &apos;s the history of journalism .
CA : But are there risks to individually or collectively sustainable societies , where there are no expected risks ?
Julian Assange : We didn &apos;t do the same thing with them .
I mean , our big harm is being done .
With information , we develop information in a particular way that is inherently normal — information that is embedded in somebody else &apos;s data .
But there are also some mysteries — like your doctor has your information ; it &apos;s a mystery — but we &apos;re talking about these vague services that come in and out of the water .
CA : OK , so they &apos;re doing it through the spirit of religion .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think , is somebody &apos;s father , whose daughter has been defending at the American flag , and she says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve effected something so much that some people are likely to cheat others .
It shows an American flag on dead people .
What this does , however , is contributing to millions of people around the world that are the U.S. Foundation .
While they &apos;re not , I &apos;m not my daughter , who would you say ? So what would you answer ?
Julian Sanjay : We &apos;ve been asking a lot of questions like this .
But remember , in Gaza , in Iraq , in Afghanistan — you don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to their opinions , it doesn &apos;t make any difference to their perceptions .
Because they see something every day .
It will drive their minds and thoughts that will give them all the numbers , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Okay , so you &apos;re hoping to hope for what you think is good news for companies and governments .
That &apos;s great .
But isn &apos;t that clear to you that in order to solve this light , you have to maintain your own consciousness like this ?
Julie Singer : Not exactly . I mean , we don &apos;t have any different fantasies .
We are not as great as the other wonderful .
If they do so , it &apos;s going to be very difficult for us , but we &apos;re doing it so that people feel morally comfortable that they &apos;re going to grow up in the future .
CA : I &apos;m thinking , we &apos;ve made the bet that we &apos;ve made the bet — that we &apos;ve made the bet over here .
You may also notice that there are different ways of thinking about who and how they are .
One is the power of people who hope .
Or take the problems .
What is the Holy Grail ?
And how are we going to solve problems ?
Julian Sanjay : Oh ! There must be something here .
CA : That &apos;s great people . That &apos;s great .
We &apos;ll try and do that . Here &apos;s another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t done yet , but I think you &apos;ve done it for TED .
Now this is a very interesting story , isn &apos;t it ?
What is this ?
Julian Assange : This is an example of what we do almost every day .
At the end of last year — in November , there were a lot of important sectors built in the banks , like the Gulf of Mexico , but not big .
And we have a reported national — which was a very good experience about this — where it was found that actually there were different types of conservation agencies running around and watching them .
And some of it was done by the Panbanian government , etc . , etc .
And there was nothing on this report . It was a very difficult job for us .
We didn &apos;t believe it because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote and what it was about .
So we had a suspicion that maybe this was a company that did all this in a few interactive games .
We did it on this foundation , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We don &apos;t really ask , but what can we do ?
It &apos;s all right , and it sounds good to see , but we can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; And then we got a letter from the back of the magazine that she wrote , and they wanted to get a handle on it . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Look , we want to get rid of it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to get rid of it .
Who are you talking about ?
Can you prove to yourself that you are legally owned ?
Is this real you ? They sent us this thing that we &apos;re looking at at in Silicon Valley with the name of Microsoft and Ed .
Yeah .
( Applause ) This has happened many times .
This is one way we can start thinking and thinking about what materials are , and that &apos;s by writing letters from these people .
CA : All right . So is any information coming from the BBC ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah , we have a lot of stuff , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re getting a bunch of stuff and we &apos;re getting a lot of stuff out of the way .
Our explanation for this has been the same in the last few months , because we are improving our buck system because of the rare emotional benefits we have .
This is research .
I mean , like any organization that &apos;s been following , more than our capabilities have been affected by our older people , and that means that we &apos;re carrying a lot of women &apos;s services , but we don &apos;t have people who believe in the way that information is .
CA : So that &apos;s the problem , fundamentally , how many journalists or journalists are there ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah . And trustworthy people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is very difficult to recycle from third , because we have to recycle the materials within our bodies , so we need to recycle the people that have been working on very , very sensitive materials , and then very low-sensitive interactions .
CA : All right , so you tell us a little bit about your nature and how you got to the end of it .
And I think who I &apos;ve learned since I was a kid was in 37 different schools .
Is that correct ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah , my parents were in the business of movies and then moving away from the hunger , and that was the impact of both of them .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist , so what this means is that anything that you carry around with you can only create mental disorder .
JS : What , the purpose of films ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you — I mean , you were a Jewish kid , and you were in a lot of hard work .
Julian Sanjay : Yeah , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist at a very young age .
I wrote a letter , I was a girl at the time when I was caught in that crime .
So you have to have a word for it .
I mean — there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Partly , at this time , it &apos;s only Russian media channel to get your mom blind account .
For this word , it &apos;s not even the first time that it was .
CA : Yeah , OK , I don &apos;t think that your grandmother &apos;s washing machine , but what do you think is your fundamental power ?
Can you tell us something about them and maybe something about their life that has helped them do it ?
Julian Assange : I don &apos;t believe in reality .
But the basic tenets : okay , powerful and hard people are not influenced ; they &apos;re growing them .
And that &apos;s the way I &apos;ve learned from my parents and some other tough people who live my life .
CA : Will ugly and ugly people not make a difference ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah , and you know , I &apos;m a very smart guy , so I &apos;m not very good at the education business , but somehow — there &apos;s another way of producing impact , which is approaching the police , crime .
And this is something that &apos;s been in my career for many , many years .
CA : So we just had this message recently : What was going on in the U.S.
Basically you &apos;ve done something here , you &apos;ve done something with a blind person , and then you &apos;ve made the newspapers available to you by reading the story .
Instead , they strike your position .
You became famous enough in the U.S. , and then what happened ?
Julian Sanjay : Yeah , it &apos;s a very big fact . You know .
Erez Linda was faced with a social crisis .
It was the strongest of them .
The blink here has grown to 10 times the size of the country &apos;s GDP .
No , we did that in July last year .
And the state-of-the-art property that happened five minutes before it was launched , as a movie : it appeared on the Nest Department of Security , and the state of Nieves Reader was , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , spend all of this time , and we got a lot of press in the U.S. , and I went to the OS and talked about it .
And these were the elements of the people there that shouldn &apos;t be repeated , and as a result , the leaders of the East Landers , some of the other international environmentalists , we didn &apos;t pass a law for a whole section of the East Land law , so it was kind of like the free media , the most protected place in the world , a new Nobel prize for freedom .
A Norden American landlord is like a Norwegian landlord , which means it &apos;s moving upwards in the system .
And just a month ago , the President of the East Link referred it to as a coincidence .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Julie .
When you look at the future , do you realize that there is more anticipation of power and energy , more security , or are we looking at the next superpower , or is it going to be all that stuff ?
Julian Sanjay : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will come from .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of pressure between the law of liberty and the law of transparency , all over the world — Europe , China and the U.S.
Who will blame this ? It &apos;s hard to say .
So this is a very exciting time to live — because with a little bit of effort , we can turn it on one side or the other .
CA : OK , so it seems like I &apos;m translating the audience into something called , Juliano , desire , and all the power to you .
Julian Assange : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a kid .
So this was my team .
( Laughter ) I was doing absolutely nothing .
I don &apos;t like playing and seeing both .
So I did this , which is to say goodbye .
I used to work for my childhood Connecticut , and I used to see it in the cafes .
When I was growing up in college and then returned back in the early &apos; 90s , I got this .
My team was mesmerized .
And when I looked at it from an intrinsic point of view , I was struck by how the rest of the world thought about it ?
And when I went to these remote villages where I used to doubt being in Northern Korea , ancient Korea , or in London , I watched the coastal plains of four marginalized creatures sprayed in the sand — pigs , tunas , salmon and cattle .
And I thought this was a very bizarre thing , and I was wondering whether anyone else would ever have a text of this educated media .
And when I took that questionnaire , I realized that people weren &apos;t watching the cooperative team .
The general public thinks something like this .
To constrain the powerful world into a few elements , there is no unusual human character .
What did we do 10 thousand years ago when we looked at our caves ?
If you look at the Moon 10,000 years ago , I think they &apos;re pretty reasonable and pretty reasonable .
But if you look back 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll only look at four animals , look , look , look , look , look .
It &apos;s true of birds .
If you look at the mines of the New York City bombsights 150 or 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see them as detectors , butterflies and South Africans .
But if you look at the remoteness of the object , you &apos;ll see just four circles : train , trap , trap , trap and trap .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving towards this .
How did that happen to us ?
Shi .
It &apos;s a whole new problem .
In the next 50 years , we &apos;ve been doing this .
The second great war has given us tremendous improvement to be a victim .
During the Great War , we had the rise of technology like the Sun , the polymer , and all those things that happened .
And since the end of the Second World War , I have come to see the increasing power of military power .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that fetuses and ceremonies have increased in agriculture , and within the next two years , their invention has grown larger than the total extinction .
Now if you put together the Feds and the forest monsoon , this will be the equivalent of two China per year .
It &apos;s not necessary to use my Chinese counter-insurgency , because China is not just one of the biggest assets , it &apos;s also one of the biggest assets .
Let &apos;s now come to our four choices .
First of all , in the United States and the West , the most commonplace is salmon food .
The forest floor is an extreme solution .
Only one pound of forest can carry five , 10 , 15 pounds of forest canopy .
Even the Indus script is an unbelievable definition .
In a study done in Darwinian University , it showed that hidden areas of carbon are being used uneffectively .
But here &apos;s the thing .
In the war zones , the war zones are the wars of introspection .
Now look at these blood vessels .
It keeps track of the Earth &apos;s footprint , the beach &apos;s safety , the beach &apos;s safety , and the household children find all the important things for the orbit .
Something like this happened with many civil wars .
Over the last 30 or 40 years , we have thousands of miles of coastal plants .
Another act that &apos;s going on here , the philosopher Mark Bono calls &quot; &quot; Nemo . &quot; &quot; Now , while you &apos;re sitting on the tropical rap , this is very troubling .
Now , there &apos;s been several reasons that young boys are hiding from the Internet , but along with it , they &apos;re putting other boxes together and subtracting them into food later on .
And many times it &apos;s done by dogs who read the &quot; &quot; Red &quot; &quot; button . It &apos;s a nice thing to watch on a cliff , which means shifting it into the food of hungry , that the environmental system itself is cooling on itself and cooling itself .
Then there &apos;s the second big food bowl in the U.S. and the West .
Tonya is a global citizen .
Tonya needs to look at very large areas to organize in a way that can be organized .
We also call our philosophical breakthrough agency , or ICCAT , the Internet Conservation for Electronic Tunes .
Carl White set up a giant airplane to reach all the tunnels .
We can do a tuna farm , but it &apos;s not good for Tony Farmer .
Not many people know , but Tony &apos;s got hot blood .
It can carry over 40 miles an hour , and instead of using its body , it can heat up over 20 times its temperature .
This is nearly all the benefits of the clinic .
The blood vessels in the pharmacy , which no longer flows .
This is the best protein .
But the forest creates 40 miles per gallon , so it can &apos;t be stayed in the forest .
Sometimes the good news has been done , it doesn &apos;t have to be done by the military .
This is my Rio Connecticut .
Connecticut was destroyed during the war .
If you think about the role of a connectome , every diet is a diet .
In Kenya , there are over 3,000 diets .
So I &apos;m saying that people in Connecticut are increasing — ( Laughter ) if anyone has solved the power of concrete , I think we can improve the world .
And everywhere , these are rockets that are being banned from giving children to Kenya .
As a result , we have a successful career with Simman Farmer .
When Samantha &apos;s farmhouse started , there were six pounds of military garbage to create a foundation for Samantha .
But now it &apos;s much better than Dubond .
Instead , there &apos;s this little bit of false reputation , because if you go on the French website , they don &apos;t give you any one-page replacement .
While this is a feedback loop .
It &apos;s hard to say something about French and French people .
But then the credit card industry says that it has become the currency for the purpose of Paul Simon .
It &apos;s a system that is growing Euclidean , and it &apos;s growing in Japan .
This has been going on for seven percent a year .
If we &apos;re doing a lot of cheating to get a market , we &apos;re doing a lot of cheating .
Not only do we drink milk , but we also drink milk and soup .
We have things like that that that are being fed up and that are being fed up .
Because the blood and the blood vessels and the blood vessels have gone down .
I wonder if there &apos;s anything that made him and that made him crave .
It &apos;s the first time that India is talking about malaria — ( Laughter ) — so it &apos;s a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking about 30 million tons of forest creatures in the last 20 years that have been used by livestock fishermen .
That &apos;s the third part of China , or the average American spends every year .
The last thing in the world is this .
Philadelphia Fish Kennedy actually started as a lifeblood .
And it started with a local entrepreneurial owner who noticed that the crowded day was not on McDonald &apos;s .
He went to Rick and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a donkey for you . &quot;
Go ahead .
The one thing that kept happening for Samantha was a little bit of a story that Hulla didn &apos;t go to Jatesus .
So he built his own laptop .
It &apos;s almost 30 cents .
He wanted to make it in 25 minutes , so he scaled it up .
General Philadelphia Candinsky is the largest washing industry in America , growing from two to three pounds a year .
If we could end the money , the differential choice might be Thailand .
Twenty years ago , Thailand had never known .
It turns out that plankton in the animal protein does a lot of efficiency , and that &apos;s what I call the third world .
Actually , this is a very good solution , and it &apos;s growing in nine months from one Indian .
The problem is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything else .
There are no iPads and DVDs that we think will keep us alive .
So what do we do now ?
I mean , this weird little clip .
Which represents a large part of 13 million tons .
One possibility that conservation policies embrace is , can we eat it ?
Can we play it safe instead of giving it away ?
There are reasons for this .
They have an Indian child who is lucky enough to be in front of a village , and is the most effective part of the village in India .
It &apos;s also a huge part of the EPA and DIY epidemic .
So this is the ability .
But can we actually do this for ourselves , and instead of making a few dollars worth of Post-it notes or Peton and replace it on a Facebook page , can we actually train our employees to try to figure out how to count the next generation of citizens ?
The other thing that &apos;s very interesting about this stuff is that it &apos;s very private .
There are many more EPAA and DVDs like Tony .
Indian accounting is extremely powerful .
There are only three parts of the Gulf of India that make it to market .
Actually , Omium 3 comes out of the house .
Sumerian waters make up three of them in the house , so they only get together .
If you look at the important world , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our waterways , it &apos;s been lost because of the use of physics and infrastructure .
Over the last 20 years , more than 400 people have been discovered , and these are very large causes of the death of life .
As you might think about clicks , these are all different sections of protein and omnivores that are highly effective .
This is how it came from .
And finally , a question mark .
We can create a condition that can provide free benefits to make a safe protein .
It needs to be green , it needs to be scaled up , it needs to be scaled up , it needs to be scaled up , it needs to be scaled up , it needs to be scaled up , it needs to be an EPA , it needs to be a DHA and it needs to be a Ph.D.
It &apos;s happening right now in papers .
I &apos;ve been working on these topics for the past 15 years .
Whenever I say this , no one says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do this . We can do this .
But don &apos;t try .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we can do that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is almost 30 million tons in Somalia .
I mean , it &apos;s all happening .
We want to think about ourselves without our needs .
But if we do something , the treatment is going to fall apart .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was a big brain learner because I have a brother who is a mental illness .
So , I wanted to think in a scientific way , how can I get my dreams out of my own truth and make my own dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re not separating their dreams from the public and the common reality , and they &apos;re putting them on top of it .
So I stopped my life doing research on mental illness .
And I was transferred to Boston by my dad , Doctor Feinstein , who was working for Dr. Feinstein Bens , who was in the spirit of Harvard University .
Because what were the responses that were trying to answer on the critical level , in the brains of those individuals who are generally visualized , are interfacing with the brains of those individuals who are being associated with schizophrenia or Shinovirus or Bob Puller ? So essentially , we were trying to build the microscopic range of the brain , which is how many cells are sending messages to the
So there was a great deal in my life , because I was doing research on this subject during the day , but on Sunday and Sunday , I was visiting a lawyer at NAMI .
But in the morning of December 10 , 1996 , I wanted to find out that I was commissioned by an intellectual disaster myself .
The right side of my brain was a nine .
And in the next four minutes , I watched my brain completely differentiate from the ability to understand information .
Falling in the morning was hard to learn how to read and to remember .
I was a nine-year-old kid in a girl &apos;s body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the same brain , there are two parts that are completely separate from each other .
I have a human brain to show you .
( Laughter ) So this is a real human brain .
This is another part of the brain with the remote region of the brain , and this is how it was held in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two pieces of it , completely separate from each other .
Those of you who think of the computer , on the right side of our brain , work like an old processor , because the left part of our brain works like a cylinder program .
These are two pieces of text messaging with each other through a crowd-sourcing collection that can be carried by 300 gigawatts .
But there are two parts of it .
Because they think about information in a different way , each part of the brain is thinking about different information , they &apos;re all about different things , and you &apos;re given the option , and I &apos;m going to be different from each other .
Thank you very much .
Audience : Jack of spades .

Right now , we &apos;re thinking about images of our brains in terms of organic thinking about the movements of our bodies .
The amount of information that comes into our bodies is spending a lot of time nourishing our entire nervous system and then rewriting it and becoming a gigantic kind of Islamic class that we see in the face of an existence , what it feels like to be in the mind and what it feels like to be in the mind .
I &apos;m a power nerd in the right part of the brain .
We are the energy cells that are connected to each other , the emotions of the right part of the brain in a human family .
And at that time , we have many brothers on this planet whose mission is to make the world a better place .
And in this case , we are absolutely the best and the best .
Our brain is a completely different place .
Most of our brains think of as linear science and military .
The rest of our brain is about the future and the future .
The right part of the brain is constructed such that we now take the largest album and we collect details and then we collect details .
And that information is organized and embedded in the past by all of those things that we &apos;ve ever learned and that the potential of the future is going to impact it on our descendants .
Most of our brain is thought of as language .
It &apos;s this constant conversation that drives us and our internal world from the outside world .
It &apos;s a little voice that tells me how to go home and buy the remembering self .
I need them in the morning ; it &apos;s a sense of reading my accounting book that reminds me that I &apos;m being pushed back .
But perhaps the most important voice is what I &apos;m saying ! Me !
And as my parents tell me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I become separate .
I &apos;m an eight-year-old in a wheelchair around me and you .
And part of my brain was working on golf this morning .
The morning of the campaign , my eyes turned to the back of the eye with a small pain .
It was the pain of this part , just like the Axis had on something .
And that pain has caught me and left me .
And then he went off and left .
For me , it was an unusual story that never occurred to me , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to start my day job . &quot; &quot; So I looked up and I looked at my card glue , which is a physical exercise .
Now I &apos;m further into this , because it feels like I have a fifth of a primary human being that has been hijacked by religion .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is so bizarre . &quot; &quot; And then I go back and I look at my body and I think , &quot; &quot; Wow , that sounds like a really bizarre and bizarre thing . &quot; &quot; And it seems like it &apos;s changed the way I feel that I &apos;m in the general sense of truth , where I &apos;m a human being being being being being being being who is passed away from that experience , but now I
And it was all very strange , and my head was growing .
So I moved away from sleep , and I started to sit in the corner , and I felt like everything was going on inside my body .
And I &apos;m thinking very hard and very hard .
There &apos;s no correlation in my behavior , and I think there &apos;s a little bit of a cornucopia going on , so my argument is only about the internal system .
I &apos;m growing up in my house , I &apos;m growing up underneath the water , and I &apos;m actually speaking inside my body .
I made a song that said , &quot; &quot; Come on , come on .
My foot goes down , and then my balance doesn &apos;t go up and down and down the wall .
I look at my hands and I see my hands , and I feel like I can &apos;t control my body right now .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going , because my hands were filled with stems and emails and plastics .
If I was trying to understand something , it was the power .
And I ask you , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s exactly where the rest of my brain is going .
It was like someone singing T.V. from the computer .
A mouth of chips .
First of all , I was struck by a blood cell from the inside of my brain .
But then immediately , like another laptop , it was in that huge space flight that was around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the limits of my body now , I felt the enormity and the strength of my body .
I felt like I was a part of that energy that was very good .
Then one uncle suddenly died in half of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; You are the lucky one . &quot;
So we need to help you , and I &apos;ve told you , I &apos;m really sorry about some problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m a bit of a real problem , but I came back immediately in this sense that I &apos;ve been talking about a lot of money .
But it was a pretty good place .
Compare that to a place where you can be absolutely attached to the hidden brain of the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this room where my writing and the printing press is about .
I was feeling so much in my body .
And measure all the relationships that you have from the outside world and from them have had some kind of tension .
And I felt safe and humiliated .
And guess what it would look like if instead of being stuck studying the emotional weight that you lost 37 years ago .
( Laughter ) Oh , I made it as a surprise .
It was very nice .
And then my brain became part of my brain , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; They said two .
We need help , and I think I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help , I need help from home , Nicholas and I need help , I &apos;m working on my apartment right now , and I &apos;m thinking , what can I do with my grandmother , and it &apos;s possible that my mother has been completely mobile .
And it occurred to me that my God is becoming a compassionate athlete , the other thing that my mind is telling me is how cool it is .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
I &apos;m going to be the brain scientist who &apos;s going to be able to control his brain , and he &apos;s going to be able to control his brain , and he &apos;s going to come from his brain — ( Laughter ) — and he &apos;s going to come from his brain . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very famous woman . ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have time to do that . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t get rid of the golf cart , but I &apos;ll come back to my normal for two weeks . Okay .
I need to get a phone call to help me get a job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t get a job description , and then I learned that my person is a knowledge card on which my phone is .
I &apos;m going to go through my study , and I &apos;m going to do a three-inch Matt Cards building .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card while I can see clearly from my brain what my blood card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s not my card , because I don &apos;t want to look at the point of view .
And the parts of the vocabulary are helped with pieces of paper and the markers , and I didn &apos;t learn anything .
And then I started to expect what I call the granny cloud .
And in that space , the general truth was repeated , and I learned that it &apos;s not a card , it &apos;s not a card .
It took me 45 minutes to reduce this data just by one inch .
And in 45 minutes , the effect of the camel on the left was escalating .
I don &apos;t know the speaker , I don &apos;t understand the phone , but I don &apos;t know the truth .
So I take a Facebook page and I put it here .
I took Benz Card , and I put him there , and now I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards , and I look at the cards .
But then I woke up to my Blue Line when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember that I didn &apos;t even have the press .
So I reached out to my golf cart as a teenager , and I laughed at the other hand , and I grabbed these hands , and when I came back to the public truth , I could tell you where I was before laughing , I had finally done it all , and I realized that the phone was on my desk , a guy answered me and said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter
I &apos;m telling you this very clearly in my brain , &quot; I &apos;m speaking to you , I need help . &quot;
And from me singing something called &quot; &quot; Woo hoo . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;m speaking like Golden Returger . &quot; &quot; And I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I was speaking any language until then .
So I understood that I needed help , and he helped me .
And then shortly thereafter , four in the imbalance , four in the Boston City Hospital was moving from one Hospital to another .
I sat down and looked like a toddler .
Just like a voice whose little air has remained and rarely left , I have taken the energy out and felt the spirit of my soul .
And it made me realize that I was no longer alone in my life .
Or my doctor saves me and gives me a different life position , or gives me a place to go .
The second time I got to this place , I was amazed that I was alive .
When I felt like giving up my soul , I gave up my life .
Now my brain was confused between two versions of reality .
At that time , I was beginning to move into the emotional system that was only feeling pure pain .
Looking at the forest floor was giving my brain a voice , and my parents were giving it a voice , and I was giving it a voice , and I was giving it a voice for the eyes of the eye .
Because I couldn &apos;t recognize my physical fitness , so I felt like I was a very large-scale and extensive sensation like a man who was released from his belly .
And my soul was unleashed like a giant wallet in the middle of nowhere .
Huge gender .
It has given me an alternative quality .
And I remember thinking , well , it &apos;s never going to be possible to find my own gigantic cello and find my own way inside the small body .
But that &apos;s when I felt like , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive . &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;m being carried by neurons .
And if I &apos;m carrying a neuron , and I &apos;m still alive today , I can get a neuron , and I &apos;ve seen a world full of people with beauty , compassion and love , who know that they can someday feel that quality .
And they can choose to live , and the right thing to do is to hide away the rest of their brain in order to find the right quality .
And then I realized how powerful this experiment could be , &quot; &quot; What a glass of glass that has taught me about my life .
And it encouraged me to be right .
After about 12 hours of being attacked , my brain triggered a blood vessel against the blood vessel that was central to the language abilities of the brain .
Here I am with my mother who is a real change in my life .
I &apos;ve been perfectly healthy for seven years .
So who are we ?
We are the most powerful force of life , along with both extremely powerful brains .
And we have the power to choose between who we are and what we want to be .
That &apos;s where I can step in the right part of my perception .
I am the powerful force of life in the universe .
Fifty thousand beautiful , creative cells are all made of cells , one in which everybody lives .
Or I can choose to step back in the back of my mind , where I become an individual , &quot; in a beautiful form .
Open your mouth .
I &apos;m a Ph.D. student , a neuroanatomist .
My inside is us .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And who ?
I think that the time we spend solving our right brain electricity is going to be safe in this world , and our planet is going to be safe .
And I thought this was necessary .
Thank you .

Good morning !
You are gone ?
They picked up my name for my tags , but I want to ask you , did anybody here write their name on the stage in Arabic ?
No ! No ? Okay , no problem .
Once upon a time , a little while ago , I was sitting in the restaurant with my friend and I were projecting to eat .
So I asked the question , do you have a free rig in Arabic ?
He looked at me in strange way , thinks he must be wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sir ? ( English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In the Arabic Church , in the Hebrew . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the French word right ?
&quot; &quot; Gosh , come on , solve this problem ! &quot; &quot; Solly said .
And he was talking to me about three men , like he was saying to me , &quot; If this is the last girl in the world , I can &apos;t see her . &quot;
What does the word &quot; &quot; meen &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
A young Lebanese teenager delivered two words to a girl in the classroom and called jihad .
How does he speak this way ?
That &apos;s when I started to think .
I got distracted by it .
Sure enough .
What &apos;s leading me to the right to linguistic scripts in my own country ?
Where could it be ?
How did we get there ?
Now while we &apos;re here , there are many people like me , who reach a stage in their lives where they routinely leave out everything that &apos;s going on in their past , just because they &apos;re so much more popular and so depressed .
Should I encourage all my culture , my imagination , my faith and my sisters ?
Perhaps we have the most important battles saved in the stories of children .
Should they give me all that I learned in Arabic ?
to be liked ?
How does that work ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to make that decision for what that was for me .
Arabic does not require today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language of science , or research , or language that we &apos;re using in universities , a language that we use everywhere in the world we work in , a language that we publish when we work on a project for advanced research , and it &apos;s certainly not a language that we preach at the moment .
If we did this , they would cover up our pile .
So where can I explain this ? We can all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . So where do we go ?
It &apos;s true .
But there &apos;s a second more important fact we should think about .
Arabic is the language of the mother .
The research says that in order to get the skill in other languages , you need to transcend your own mother tongue .
In other languages , the intrinsic language for creativity is the main building block .
How ?
The jihad cell type , when it first started writing , exploited Arabic .
All of his thoughts , his imagination and philanthropy were inspired by this little boy in that village where he grow up , felt a special sense of gratitude , a special voice , and just thought about .
Once they started writing in English , they had enough materials .
Even when they wrote in English , when you read their English texts , you felt so happy , you felt the same sense .
You can imagine that this is their own writing in English , this little boy who lives in a trench all over the place .
Now , here &apos;s an example that nobody can do .
And second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation is to stop that language .
It &apos;s a fact that &apos;s happened in the developed world .
Germany , France , Japan and China all have that .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their tongue .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in products , spend a lot of money on dissemination .
Do we know any better ?
Okay , we &apos;re not from the developed world , this evolved mindset is not yet reaching us , and we want to move into this developed world .
The countries that looked like us in one time , but decided to try to make progress , study and move to those countries , such as Ramadan , Tanzania , and so on , they brought their language to their ranch as they were climbing the campaigns .
They kept it near them .
Because if you go to Turin and where you do your products , and it &apos;s not in the store , it &apos;s not local manufacturing .
You won &apos;t believe these are local manufacturing .
And they &apos;re going to be entering these consumers , unknown consumers , as we know them more time .
So to create new inventions and new facilities , they had to maintain their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Autism , autism , freedom , &quot; &quot; what does that remind you ?
What would you understand ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who , how and where .
Languages are not just about the conversation , only words are affected by us .
Languages contain a very specific set of steps in our lives , and sentences that are connected to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Self , automation , freedom , &quot; &quot; each and every one of you will create a special circuit in your brain . Each of you has special emotions for a given day in a unique history .
Language is not the name of taking one or two or three words together .
It &apos;s an insight that &apos;s really based on our thinking , and how we look at each other and how we view each other .
What is our intuition ?
How would you not understand it ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; or if your daughter comes to you and says , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the time of the freedom ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t have a problem , well , I better go and spend a lot of time dicking around .
The thing is , it reminds us of a special thing .
A friend of mine , a French speaker , had a French speaker .
I was asking her for a second .
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once again , I spent the night trying to eradicate her husband and translate what that means &quot; &quot; humiliation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The brown woman abruptly called her &quot; &quot; humiliation , &quot; &quot; and then all night trying to understand her .
He wondered , how could someone be so obvious ?
Do they want to be self-organizing ?
&quot; &quot; Bury me &quot; &quot; ( English ) ( Laughter ) This is one of a few examples .
It made us realize that she absolutely didn &apos;t have the meaning of this word , because she couldn &apos;t understand , and she was right ; the way she thought about it was different .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , he listens to me for the day , and one night , I tried to translate it to feel what I feel when I hear the FedEx . &quot; &quot; And the woman was trying to translate it : &quot; &quot; Well , I raised my hand and you got it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And SM : And because you &apos;re me , I put my hand back and you leave . &quot; ( Laughter )
translate .
( Applause ) So , what did we do to break the Arabic language ?
We replaced it into a society and we started an Arabic language Conservation campaign .
After many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you in trouble ?
Leave the cold , slow down . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The Arabic language Protection campaign heard a saying , &quot; I talk to you east , but you answer the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept it . You don &apos;t speak in this language . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t understand this way , because in this way , we don &apos;t understand them .
And if someone tells me , I hate the Arabic language .
We call it â€” ( Applause ) We want to change our situation , and we want to be responsible in the way that our dreams , our dreams , and our daily lives .
It &apos;s a letter that looks like us and the way we think .
So this sentence is , &quot; &quot; I talk to you in the East , but you answered the West . &quot; &quot; The right sign is the right sign .
Very simple but powerful and effective .
After that , we started another campaign with the landscape of the letters .
You see , just outside of it , a context with a letter in black and blue on top of the text , with the translation , &quot; don &apos;t kill language . &quot;
Why ? Well , don &apos;t kill your tongue .
We really shouldn &apos;t have to kill our language .
If we killed our language , we would have to know for ourselves .
We have to find a existence for ourselves .
We have to go back to the beginning .
And it &apos;s a great deal more than the opportunity to create modernity and religion .
After that , we took pictures of boys and girls who were already in Arabic .
Cole models of boys and girls .
We are so hot !
And if someone says , &quot; &quot; Yes ! You &apos;ve used the English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve picked the word &quot; &quot; chocolate . &quot; &quot; They want to make a doubt about it , but I have to find a word that &apos;s so good that it &apos;s really the same thing .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; the Internet , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go around the corner of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because these are not motels ! We shouldn &apos;t shrink from you .
But to get to that point , we all need to create an argument that we &apos;re not going to let anyone make a bigger or a sense that we have access to the problem of language , putting pressure on us , or licking out our patient and thinking .
Our idea has to be creative .
So , if we can &apos;t reach the skin or not rebuild the rocket , we can be reinvented .
Now , each and every one of you is a creative project .
You have a way to create in the mother tongue .
Let &apos;s start with this day .
They make a fuss or a short film .
Once upon a time , we get to the global level .
He can repeat the Arabic text on the first level .
Well , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there &apos;s a solution !
But we have to know , and we have to be confident that the solution is there , part of this solution .
Honestly , what can you do today ?
Which of you is Twitter ?
In the bush , I rejoice you , even though , my time has finished , or Arabic , English , France or Chinese .
But the numbers , don &apos;t write Arabic with the Latin letters !
( Applause ) It &apos;s spam ! It &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;ll enter a virtual world with a classical language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back from there .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we can do a lot more .
We &apos;re not here today to talk to each other .
We &apos;re here to meet the need for this language .
Now I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
A child , for the first time , has to translate their father into English .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say that , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey , and I promised my daughter in the store , if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Dis , thank you , Mom .
And you wouldn &apos;t expect anyone to hear that . ( Applause ) You just get this culture of crap . ( Applause )
I speak a little English about it to us , and it is sad to remember that our present situation is not a secret of my being , and the bad guys who are busy protecting my people , even when you see my generation and you see us as bankers , and we don &apos;t have this generation of inequality , and we don &apos;t have good faith in our generation when they don &apos;t know how to give guidelines ,
( Applause )
I love the chocolate data .
In college , I had my primary thoroughfare , which meant I had to write a lot of document .
Now a regular person , when they write something , will have something to do with it .
You know , you may â€” ( Laughter ) may actually start working very quickly , but in the first week , they do a lot of work , and after all , everything &apos;s done , but it &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
And that &apos;s what I want to do .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
My response is going to be everything , but basically the incentive is going to get there , and then I &apos;m going to do something like that .
( Laughter ) And this is what happens to every writer .
And then came the new paper , a paper which you do in a year .
And I knew that my normal actions were not good enough to do this kind of thing .
That was a huge thing .
I plan . I decided I &apos;d do something like this .
This is what it &apos;s going to look like this year .
I &apos;m going to start with a little bit of effort , in the middle of the months , turn up the steps , and eventually I &apos;m going to increase it just like a puzzle .
How hard can it be to read ?
No big deal , right ?
Then came the crazy thing .
How about a few months ?
He comes and goes , and I can &apos;t do anything else .
So we rebuilt a magnificent project .
( Laughter ) And then â€” ( Laughter ) But then she would go away , and I didn &apos;t write anything , and we were just there .
And two months were changed in a month , which changed in two weeks .
And then I went away one day and I spent three days in the auditorium , and I still didn &apos;t write a word , and then I did what I could do in 72 hours , and I wrote down 90 pages , two streets , and what they did was they didn &apos;t have to go on two streets â€” people were walking on a convent , spending time in the convent , and they were all over the world .
I thought , this is it .
I got a call one week later , and he was from school .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Do you want to be Tom ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , we want to talk to you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; Look , this is the perfect . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wasn &apos;t sure . ( Laughter )
He was a huge believer . ( Laughter )
I wanted to be excited by that moment , when all of you were thinking , &quot; This is amazing . &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , they &apos;re very powerful .
Well , today I log in .
&quot; &quot; I write a blog , &quot; &quot; but why ?
A few years ago , I started writing about the Indus script .
My behavior always kills six people and I wanted to tell six people what &apos;s going on in the brain of people and why we are .
Now , my hypothesis was that the brain makes a difference between people six .
Realizing that this is why I took a lab where I studied two brain areas like the brain of the left brain , so I could compare them .
And I &apos;m actually here to show you .
I want you to look really closely and say , there &apos;s a difference .
I know if you &apos;re not a trained teacher , that &apos;s not so explicit , but consider this .
So here &apos;s the brain of a six person .
( Laughter ) Now ...
Here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) It makes a difference .
In both of these brains , there &apos;s a decade ahead , but the rest of the brain is in the human brain , and it &apos;s entertaining .
Now , what does this mean in a test tube ?
It means everything &apos;s fine until it &apos;s gone .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Workforce is the best time to work together &#93; &#91; No ! &quot; &quot; &#93; The smart guy will make a decision to make meaning , but he didn &apos;t like this plan , so he tells the audition-ers , and he says , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t read the chocolate page . &quot; &quot; Tennis and Twain , because I know it &apos;s happened right now .
( Laughter ) So â€” ( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to go to the next level , and you &apos;re going to see something new in 10 minutes ?
Then you look at YouTube , beginning with the TEDTalk about fast , and soon after you stopped looking at the one-way interfaces of Mom .
( Laughter ) It would take a little time for all of those things , so it wouldn &apos;t take much time to do today .
What a contract ! ( SM : Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Now this isn &apos;t the foundation of compassion that you want to call .
It just wants to be in that moment .
It understands the unimagined future , and it &apos;s only about two things : compassion and mercy .
In the animal world , that &apos;s all well .
If you do and you spend your whole life going forward , then you &apos;re pretty successful !
( Laughter ) And to make it , there &apos;s a generation of human animals .
Great food , good sleep , and increasingly , that &apos;s what happened in the last few years .
But if you haven &apos;t noticed , it &apos;s not that far off .
We are a progressive civilization , and we don &apos;t even know it .
So there &apos;s another person in our brain that &apos;s deciding , a remote person , that &apos;s able to do something that no other animal can do .
We can think about the future .
We are remoter .
We make big plans .
And he &apos;s thinking about all of these things .
And all we want to do is share the way we enjoy it .
Sometimes it seems just the right thing to do , which is to eat simple and enjoy the goods , to sleep or enjoy the opportunity moment .
So there &apos;s a problem .
Sometimes it happens .
And sometimes it seems too appropriate for them to do what &apos;s difficult for a big cause .
And this is the climate agreement .
And for the rest of the audience , this contradiction always leads to the end , which spends more time in the short run , a simple and pervasive way out of the room .
I call it a perfect place .
( Laughter ) The Dark Ages are a place that people pretty well know .
There &apos;s an age when distraction doesn &apos;t have to be a leader .
What &apos;s interesting to you in the dark field is that it &apos;s not really the fun , because it &apos;s not your right , it &apos;s a crime of space , of fear , of insecurity , and just all of the characteristics that are in the right place .
The question is , in this way , when the principal is headed , how do the listeners get in the voice , who &apos;s poor but crucial ?
It turns out that the Sistine people are also defenseless , who are always protecting it in these specific times â€” anybody who said it at home .
( Laughter ) Now this is a house that &apos;s more common , but when it &apos;s closer to the data online , it &apos;s fine to say whether or not people are at risk of embarrassment , employment or scary results .
And the important thing is that the original is just that .
Now , this has been a real relation in my life , because six months ago , TED people called me and they gave me a TEDTalk .
( Laughter ) Well obviously I did .
My dream was to join TED in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But between my anger and anger , something else was going on in the brain of the disturbance .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve understood everything ?
Do we know what &apos;s going to be the future ?
We should just start working on it . The principal said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I do . &quot; &quot; But why don &apos;t we Google and look at the map of India down to 20,000 feet , and we &apos;ll just break it down until we see all over India , and we &apos;ll feel good about India . ( Laughter ) So that day we did . ( Laughter )
In six months , it went through two and a half months , and the people at TED decided to call the merchant .
I downloaded the website , and there was a photograph of me holding it .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) The house was under control , and within seconds the whole system was under threat . ( Laughter )
And remember the bear â€” he &apos;s scared of the house , he &apos;s walking up the tree !
Finally , and finally , long-term decision makers spontaneously came together and I can start working on a conversation .
Now , the homemade player who &apos;s blamed for every kind of crazy thing , someone like me would give two weeks for a day and not write at all the same time , and then incredibly encourage the unbelievable lesson of staying and writing in the first place .
And three key areas of clarity at this time â€” the system is called the Sest people .
That &apos;s very good , not the lymphatic .
And a few years ago , I decided to write about it .
When I wrote this , it surprised me with the impact on it .
I &apos;ve actually received thousands of miles from around the world and from people , from different types of backgrounds .
They included bankers , bankers , engineers , peters and CDs .
( Laughter ) And so almost the same thing was said and wrote : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
What was surprising to me was the number of emails and readings given by email .
In the script of these people , I was listening to a mixture of what Solly wrote about her life , about what she did .
I thought about it , and I said , well , if the system is right , what &apos;s the problem ?
Why are all of these people in the dark ?
Well , it turns out there are two ingredients on the list .
So today I gave you some examples , talking about things , and they were all online .
And when the data is online , the effects of delegation are declining because the home that &apos;s accumulated .
But there &apos;s a second kind of right-hand side to the system , and it doesn &apos;t have to do with any data .
So if you want a project that starts with you as an arts or a business â€” some kind of arts or businesses , as long as you don &apos;t start paying attention to getting in the way to work .
Also there &apos;s a lot more to do with the private sector that doesn &apos;t have an online dating , things like get in your family , get to exercise , find your health , find your relationships , tell your relationships to the good that &apos;s not being trafficked .
Now , if the only way to go to a test is to find a way to do a test bed , that &apos;s hard , because all of the data that &apos;s occurring in the context of a home that &apos;s gone .
He doesn &apos;t have anything to do . The good news is that you can &apos;t steal them , they &apos;re always with you .
And it &apos;s a kind of long tradition that comes to see very little and talks about much less than the stereotypical impotence , the playful state of affairs .
You are pathologically damaged .
And this can be driven by the longer term pain and the longer term .
So I thought that was the reason they had emails , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in the forest .
They &apos;re not designed for anyone .
The Taliban recruitment granted them , sometimes in their lives .
The anxiety is not that they cannot contain their dreams , but that is that they cannot cooperate .
I read all the email and revealed one thing : I think six people don &apos;t exist .
I think all of you are SOLEs .
You may not have a very complex situation . Some of us â€” ( Applause ) and probably some of you have good relationships with the Dutch web , but remember the keyboards when there &apos;s no Death Valley .
Now I want to leave you with one last thing .
I call it the career of life .
Every block means a week , it &apos;s in the new year .
Not very many blocks , especially when some of them are expensive .
I think we all need to be careful in this kaleidoscope .
We need to think about what we &apos;re doing in the bush , because there &apos;s no time in every single life .
We need to be careful .
It is for all of us .
And we don &apos;t have that many families there , but maybe we should just start .
Well perhaps not today , but ...
( Laughter ) You know what .
Sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
On that day , a document from the United States and Afghanistan , an accent of eight days of the U.S. and Afghanistan was leaving out of Afghanistan from a region of Afghanistan , and Afghanistan was leaving out from a region of Afghanistan to lobby for an office to help protect an office for the Afghan State Services , so that they could help to secure an office for the Afghan State Council to help
The military doctrine came in at the headquarters of an assault , and they were surrounded by three other things , and with a lot of things , they saw a childhood of the Cape Twin Seventine , and they saw a childhood of rage to save and save the dead .
One of the people who rescued her children , one of the Sergees and one of the Spanish medical adventures , was moving toward a hospital captain and he was also moving toward a hospital emergency room .
So it &apos;s shown that the Copenhagen and the Aspirit of Copenhagen take over this mysterious fad that flowers in the winter .
They put them into the helmet and then you see them go to the Copenhagen and throw them into piles before they can protect others .
I looked at it and asked myself , where do people come from ?
What is this ? These are the very emotions when you want to do something like this .
There &apos;s a love and I knew why it &apos;s because I work with people that I don &apos;t .
You know , you go to the pocket to people who are yearning to experience themselves in a way that benefits others .
In business , we give bonuses to people who are yearning to experience other people in ways that make us serve .
We have an electrical calculus !
So I asked myself , where do such people come from ?
And my initial result was that these were better people .
Which is why they go to the Arctic Ocean .
These people seem to be looking after the idea of merit .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s a environment , and if you have the right environment , each and every one of us has the potential to work together , then each and every one of us has the potential to work together and make it greater and have the potential to do it in other places .
I &apos;ve got a great privilege of getting to meet with some people that we &apos;re going to call &quot; &quot; mother &quot; &quot; yesterday , and I &apos;ve got a great privilege of getting to meet with some of the people that we &apos;ve asked yesterday who brought you and your knowledge to save other people , and I asked you , &quot; Why can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing , &quot; Because they do it to me . &quot;
It &apos;s a profound sense of trust and collaboration .
So trust and collaboration are critical .
The challenge with the idea of trust and collaboration is that these are emotions , not obstacles .
You can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; rescue me &quot; &quot; and you do .
It &apos;s not possible that I give two people the chance to collaborate and that &apos;s what they do .
It doesn &apos;t work that way . It &apos;s an emotion .
So where does this aspiration come from ?
If you go further back 50,000 years , at the very beginning of the Homo sapiens , what we see is that the world is full of threats , all of these texts are hardworking to us .
There &apos;s no private thing .
Dreading can be a lack of resources , but it &apos;s a long-term TEDster , and it &apos;s all working together to mitigate the longer lifespan of everything that &apos;s working together to mitigate our life .
And so in this way , we were ready as social animals , where we were staying together and working together as part of what I call a Charter , a tribe where we felt about our personal relations .
And when we felt really secure in ourselves , we were both broadband and collaborative .
It has an ongoing benefit .
It means I can go to sleep at night and I can browse to see some of the dangers in my neighborhood .
If we don &apos;t drive each other . &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t drive you , that means you don &apos;t look at the risks .
It &apos;s a system for the rest .
That &apos;s exactly what the modern day is .
It &apos;s a world that &apos;s full of threats that are struggling to make our lives harder or attempt to shrink our success . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re trying to reduce our chance of success .
It could be a market mechanism . It could be a market mechanism .
It could be a new technology that pulls your business assembly and drops it at night can be a new technology that your business strategy and leaves you at night .
Or you may have a fight who &apos;s sometimes trying to kill you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to get you out of business , but at least it drives your development and your business effort to drive away from you , and it drives your development and your business to stay ahead of you .
We have no control over these powers .
It &apos;s an infinite thing , and it never ends .
The only driver of change is the conditions within an organization , and that &apos;s where the job is , because it &apos;s the belief that defines the direction .
When a leader picks out to preserve the people in her organization and their lives to protect the people in her organization and protect the lives of the people in her organization , and this is to assess their peace and loss results so that people are there and that they sacrifice so that people can feel secure and feel their personal relations , they have the knowledge of what &apos;s there .
I was touring around a holiday track and I noticed an occurrence that when a passenger attempted to enter it before he &apos;d finished it , and I noticed the staff on the door just before he passed the man that he &apos;d won the piece of legislation to follow .
Once upon a time , he was forced to stay on him , one of the first men to climb up to him .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you keep cutting things like this ?
Why can &apos;t you just sit in rows like us as humans ? &quot; &quot; And soon he answered me that completely .
He does not trust his leaders .
The reason we love to travel to the West Virlines is not because they keep the Lamanic people happy .
That &apos;s because they don &apos;t give up their leaders .
See , if we have conditions , we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and we spend our time and our strength keeping you safe from each other , and it turns out to weigh the organization .
What &apos;s a great leader for her , and I can leave you with one of the closest examples that being a parent is a good leader for her , and I think it &apos;s the closest example of being a parent .
If you think about what a good parent is like , what would you want ? What makes you want ? ( Laughter ) A good parent ?
We want to give our kids the opportunity , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , we want to give them the opportunity , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the tools to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves to grow and to achieve more of what we can do for ourselves .
That &apos;s what good leaders want .
They want to give their people opportunities , education , discipline and record , when it &apos;s needed , they want to give their people the opportunities , education , discipline , when it &apos;s needed , to give them the opportunity to create self-esteem , to have fun and work so that they can achieve more success that we &apos;ve never imagined so that they can achieve more advances than ever imagined .
Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the Next Jump in New York City , is the head of a tech company called Charlie Ken , who &apos;s the head of a tech company in New York City , and they say , if your family &apos;s ever tough time , will you ever let your kid go ?
We will never do that .
So how do we get people out of our organization and then how do we get people out of our organization ?
Charley has a practical impossibility of task allocation , and Charlie has a practical impossibility of task allocation .
If you get a job in Next Jump , you don &apos;t get a job on the basis of efficiency .
Instead , if you have a problem , they &apos;ll conduct you and help you , in the same way that we do for our kids who come to school to get a C in the morning .
It &apos;s totally different .
That &apos;s why so many people are so frustrated and angry , some of the bankers who are sitting at the CEO , and that &apos;s why so many people are so angry and angry , some of the bankers who are at the top , and that &apos;s because so many people are so angry and angry , some of the bankers who are very uncomfortable with these things .
This isn &apos;t about data .
Instead , they define the fundamental principle of diversity .
They &apos;ve driven a profound social society .
We know that they &apos;ve given their well-to-do children through the experience of their loved ones , and we know that they &apos;ve given their well-to-do children the experience of their loved ones , but instead of deceiving to have children of their well-to-do children , they &apos;ve told them to bear their well-to-do children , and they &apos;ve convinced their communities to bear .
It &apos;s what gives us context , not data .
Can the assumption is that it &apos;s 150 million dollars for business ?
Why don &apos;t we just give them 250 million dollars ?
Is there a problem with it ? Absolutely not .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to protect data .
A good leader will never sacrifice people to protect data .
Instead , they &apos;re going to give people shorter data to save , but they &apos;re going to give them shorter data to save .
They run a mining company in the BBC &apos;s Media Democratic nomination for a company called Barry-Whemiller in 2008 , and they &apos;ve gone through a 300-percent career in their 20s .
Now in a large mining company , that &apos;s a big problem and they cannot overcome their benefits much .
They needed saving 10 million dollars , so most of the companies that are now covering the board and doing the right thing .
And boy reacted to it .
You see , the bus is not believing in the script .
It &apos;s more difficult to lower your heart rate , your stress level , your stress level .
And they built a dedicated program .
that every employee , every single one of them , had to go to the CEO in a small four-week vacation .
They could never do that when they wanted and they didn &apos;t have to follow it .
But the way the bus announced the program was very important .
He said that it was better for all of us to suffer a little bit of damage , because some of us would suffer a lot of damage and a lot of that pain .
So they have saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as you might expect , when people feel secure in an organization , then trust and cooperation is natural .
And structurally , as nobody expected , people started to buy each other .
The ones that were most successful did lead to a low-performing business .
That means somebody gives up five weeks to get the other person to give three weeks .
Bias is a critical unit .
I know a lot of people who are very good at organizing , and I know a lot of people who are at the very best in terms of organizations that are not leaders at all .
They &apos;re amateur soloists , and we do what they say , because they have access to us , but we don &apos;t follow them .
And I know a lot of people from different walks of organizations that don &apos;t have any authority , and they &apos;re a real leader , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the other person on the left , and that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been an inspiration to look at the person on the right , and they &apos;ve had the privilege of looking at the person on the right .
It &apos;s a leader .
I heard a story about some forces that were outside of the theater and just as philanthropy was a way of cooking in honor , and she played her friends before and when she ate , she saved nothing for her .
And when he came back to the field , his friends gave him some food from his food to eat because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We tell them to lead .
We call them leaders because they take risks first , we call them leaders because they take risks first .
We call them a leader because they choose to be a victim so that people can be safe and we call them a leader because they choose to be a victim so that their people can be safe and we say them to them because they choose to be a victim so that people can be safe and have that interest in them , and when we do that , our natural responsibility is to give our people the victims .
They &apos;ll give us their blood and pneumonia and go to see if their leader &apos;s dream is real , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why do you do this ?
Why can you put your blood and your pneumonia and your veins to this man ? &quot; &quot; So they all say the same thing : &quot; &quot; Because they do this to us . &quot; &quot; And is this not the organization that we would all like to work with ?
And isn &apos;t that the organization we &apos;re going to like to do everything ? And isn &apos;t that the organization we all want to work for ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up with a little story about Motetema , a little bit of Limpopo , who is very well known to the edge of the Limpopo and the Mumbai .
Where the water supply and electricity is really unbelievable , as it were , it &apos;s very difficult to grow up in these conditions at the age of 17 , I was staying still in the winter with friends in the winter .
The sun is heating up in the winter .
And as I was filling out in the bush , my best friend said , &quot; &quot; Yes , why doesn &apos;t you create something that just touches your skin and doesn &apos;t have to be touched ? &quot; &quot; So I sat down , and I immediately said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I just went home . &quot; &quot; And I did some research and I found some amazing data .
Today there are 2.5 billion people who don &apos;t have access to water and sanitation .
Four out of them are in Africa , and there &apos;s only one in South Africa .
Different diseases are found in the environment that is one of the most dangerous things called trchoma .
One of the things that happens with the loss of the eye is you can actually get injured by having more than one of the injections on the track .
This disease consistently inspires eight million people every year , and the most scary thing is , you only have to give up your month for the children in the trachoma : no dice , no cells , no engineering .
After I looked at the statistical data , I thought , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m not just doing it for myself , and not just doing it , but I &apos;m doing it for at least because I want to protect the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Then , Mario broke out of her 6234 mobile phones â€” because I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have a Internet about 20 hours of Internet files on Google , and I did some research
And I looked at this as a kind of a profound problem in the box .
So , Mahatma was right . Our family was ready .
Now we need to put this in context .
Four years later , and after I wrote my patent on the mobile phone for 40 pages , I &apos;m the smallest patent holder in the country and â€” ( &quot; &quot; now and not dirty ! &quot; &quot; ) â€” I couldn &apos;t say that anymore . ( Laughter ) I invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first slogan .
You just put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t need to be careful .
( Laughter ) So after trying to be effective in high school and confined resources , which I had , the Machine YoYo Mas joined up with some new people , some new people , and now we have an impact on what &apos;s ready for the market , but now we have access to the market .
We learned a few lessons from DryBath to commercialize and to people .
One of the things we learned was that the poor don &apos;t buy products at large .
They just buy the names they need . One person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a ticket ; he buys a ticket every day , because that &apos;s how much more money they need .
So we built DryBath in these creative blocks .
You just push it in between and outside .
And the best part is , a simple replacement of a cow is only in five .
After this model was invented , we learned a lot more about the consumer sales .
We even want rich-world kids to come here to want DryBath â€” ( Laughter ) once a week .
However , we felt that we could save 80 million liters of water on average , whenever they leave , and we could save two hours for children who live in the same neighborhood , two hours for more homes , more than two hours for a school , two more homes for the kid .
After looking at global impacts , we took this out to our core values of value , health and sality .
DriBath is the service of a rich man and a life of a poor man .
By stumbling this project into the process , we &apos;re actually entering a period of manufacturing that can be sold in the retail market , and a question that I have for my audience today , at the Current of the Limpopo , within a week , we &apos;re going to launch a 50-year link with an alphabet that doesn &apos;t have to cover the world .
What &apos;s going on ? ( Applause ) I haven &apos;t finished , I haven &apos;t finished .
And one of the more important things is that I learned a lot in the course of this last year , Google announced me as the world &apos;s first young girl .
I &apos;m still the world &apos;s greatest student entrepreneur , the first African that has access to academia , and one of the things that surprised me most , which was why I didn &apos;t want to go blaming for this . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , interestingly , I &apos;m here today to offer you some of the results that may surprise me and wonder what the leading causes of success in organizations are because of what &apos;s actually leading to the initial success .
I believe that donor agencies are a fantastic way to create a better place in the world .
If you select a group of people with the desire to equality waste and organize them at the beginning , you will find all the human abilities that were previously impossible .
You &apos;ll see them make the impossible possible .
But , if initial organizations are so good , why is it that most of the time the failure ?
That &apos;s why I wanted to understand .
I wanted to know what was the most important thing for success at the beginning .
I wanted to be very organized about this , pushing a lot of my moral thought and false beliefs that had led me to some of the institutions in the past .
I wanted to know this because I was beginning a different business at 12 years of age , going to Hyderabad High School , going to school and making solar tools , then to college , when I made a low-performing school .
I graduated from high school , and I started a software company .
And 20 years ago , the Alliance of India started , and in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve run over 100 companies , and we &apos;ve run most of the breakthroughs .
We learned a lot about these failures .
I tried to look at these factors as the best cause of organization success or failure .
So I looked at these five .
First of all , think .
I think there &apos;s something .
And so that &apos;s why I put out the name of my company &apos;s idea Live , the very first moment that you feel about something .
But more recently , I thought that maybe the team , the leadership or the ability to bend , is even more critical for thinking .
I never imagined that there would be a lot of talk at TED last , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a plan for everybody , even if I don &apos;t have one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s true for business .
It is critical to the ability to connect a team to heal from the neighborhood to the neighborhood .
Hatzalah is an honest reality .
So I thought that was probably the leading team .
So I started to look at the business model .
Does an organization have an explicit action about income ?
But also this idea stuck in my head the most important thing for success .
So think about investment .
Sometimes companies get a big investment .
Perhaps that &apos;s the most important one ?
After this , of course â€” is it time ?
Did the idea go so fast , and the world was not ready for it ?
It &apos;s fast , so you &apos;re going to go and teach the world ?
Is that true ?
Or was it too late , and before there was so much anxiety ?
So I went through a lot of these five sentences with a lot of attention .
And the idea was that 100 companies in the Libya , and 100 of them outside of the Libya could achieve a scientific conclusion .
So first of all , these new Libra companies , the first five companies â€” Citysearch , CarsDirect , Goods , NetZero , Tickets.com â€” all of these are dollars of commerce .
And the bottom five companies â€” Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink , we were very hopeful , but not very successful .
And so I tried to build these identities as I think these companies have made progress in these places .
So in the businesses outside of Libya , I noticed some strange breakthroughs , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn .
Some things : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Frind .
Not a lot of investment in small businesses , and sometimes it was a business model , but it wasn &apos;t successful .
I tried to find out what was the most impact on the success and the failure of all of these companies , and the result surprised me .
The first was the choice of time .
At the right time , it &apos;s 42 percent of the wealth gap between success and failure .
The team and the organization are on the other hand , and then , being different , I think , is unique , it &apos;s actually number three .
But the fact that it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s not that the idea doesn &apos;t matter , but looking at it and I was blown away that the idea is not the most important .
Sometimes it &apos;s more important when it &apos;s time .
Finally , business model and investment in my mind .
I think that the market model is still very boring , because you can start without a market model , and then you put in a market mechanism .
And even investing , if it was low-income but it &apos;s increasing now , particularly in today &apos;s times , it &apos;s very easy to get investment .
I &apos;d like to give you some examples of all of these notes .
Take the big Airbnb , which everybody knows .
Many of the investors , they noticed , because people thought , well , who &apos;s going to give a part of your home for a tickler ?
Of course , that was the wrong evidence .
Well , one of the reasons for the success of compassion is because of the best market model , the idea , and the market perspective is just the right time .
This company came in confronted with the challenges of finance when people needed additional income , and it surely helped people respond to the atrocities in their homes .
That &apos;s Uber .
Uber comes in , the best company , the best market model , the best thinkers .
But , time was everything right to make the drivers of their need .
Dreaders were also aspiring for additional income ; this was absolutely critical .
Some things , as Citysearch arrived at the time when people needed a page .
Goto.com , which we published in 1998 here at TED , was around the time when companies wanted to become more open to companies .
We thought we were great , but in fact , the right time was probably more important .
And then some failures .
We started Z.com , which was an online entertainment company .
We were so excited about this â€” working with lots of chefs and some of the best market models , Hilly Wheel brilliant workers .
Between 1999 and 2000 , the broadband band was very little .
It was so difficult to watch the online video , you didn &apos;t have to know what to do with your browser , and eventually this company reached its end in 2003 .
Just two years later , when Adobe Flash solved the problem of the cockroach and the broadband in America , more than 50 percent of them died , came to the top of YouTube .
Great , good time .
As it turns out , YouTube was not a market model at all .
They didn &apos;t believe it was going to work .
But he was the best of times .
So to cut a long story short , perception is really critical .
Idea is critical .
But maybe time is critical .
And the best way to test time is to see if there &apos;s ever going to be a car seat to get you .
And to be super honest , what you &apos;ll find is that those results are not made up , because if you like something , you should stay ahead , but you have to work with the time frame .
As we &apos;ve said , early organizations can change the world , they can create a better place .
Hopefully some of them are helping you increase your chance of succeeding , and then it won &apos;t be the other way around the world .
Thank you very much , all of you .

&#91; 3 on September 2016 we saw the biggest data that we had in history &#93; &#91; Fund papers decorated rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; in shelter for a few not-for-profit &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We took the Rabbit of the Gulf Venture . &#93; &#91; We were going to be the center of the week &apos;s championship with the two million articles offered by
Fifteen years ago , these papers were used in small construction companies .
We have the inner stories of coaches , benchmarks and poachers who walk through the halls of the Muhammad and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we need a workshop , can you give us ? &quot; &quot; You can actually see an email , you can actually see an exchange of messages , you can see a way of doing that , how they accomplish the work .
The impact has just begun to be manifest .
The President of the United States has been covered .
We also heard about how weekday dictatorships are used by conservation companies .
The employment of two billion dollars goes to the main building block of the Royal Academy of Divine , which is his childhood friend , the celebrity test .
And many wealthy people are going to be infected and , at the same time , are going to be at the forefront calling for more private documentaries . They &apos;re going to be home .
Now that sounds like a magic trick or a violin story with me .
What should we take from it ?
But the truth is that astronomers and power people sit in a search for their money and the more taxes they shouldn &apos;t give , which means that wealth improvements like advanced access to health and education .
And this affects all of us .
My organization for Galapagos Venture , this is amazing .
And global media and political leaders are talking about how people have their influence in the weapon companies that talk about deeply in our hands .
I think it &apos;s a world that &apos;s open for people , and it &apos;s really hard to understand how smart companies work .
I think it &apos;s like traffic jams .
You can put a second company inside a company , a second company inside , which is pretty much impossible to figure out who &apos;s behind that .
Companies that are regulating law enforcement , press , school , are hard to understand what &apos;s going on .
I think that &apos;s what &apos;s really interesting here in the United States .
Maybe that &apos;s because the major Americans don &apos;t have to be in the classroom .
Now this doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no wealthy people in the United States .
This is because the road companies work , there are a few in the U.S.
I think if we look at the discoveries of Women &apos;s Leaders or the Digital Viewers or the Navy &apos;s notes , there are things that are connected to America .
Instead , a lot of Americans don &apos;t have to give much information , they have to give you little information to get the company out of the Libra card .
This kind of infrared is given to the students in the U.S.
Nine billion dollars of this is what makes it easy .
This kind of cross-pollination affects all of us .
Now in Galapagos , we wanted to see what this problem looks like .
How does it actually work ?
So what we did was we hooked up a department and we sent it to 13 clean mining companies in Manhattan .
Our department as an African minister wanted to move to America , a home , a ship and a place to buy .
The heart attack was that all the vessels had provided a one-way street to guess how the vessels moved .
These were all early applications , and we had no budget , and we didn &apos;t pay anyone , but this disrupted the system .
And also , it &apos;s important not to treat it as individual goods .
It &apos;s not about the individual voice that has talked to us about slavery and mercy .
It &apos;s not just about a senior politician who was found in Sydney .
It &apos;s the system &apos;s way of validating taxation , pollution , poverty and injustice .
And in order to have that , we have to change this game .
We have to change the rules of the game so that the game can be difficult in that way .
It may be ironic , because for what we can &apos;t do about it , we can never change it , the rich and the powerful people are always going to be .
But as a positive person , I think something changes .
So in the last few years , we &apos;ve been increasing the visibility of the company as a whole .
This issue has been put on the political agenda , but the British Prime Minister of Defense Department of Defense at 8 cents that were in the South Age of 2013 .
And Europe has been building a global record of what the leading candidates are actually in Europe , or who is controlling them .
The thing is , the I.S. is behind it .
Compared on a planet of rational regulatory systems in the center and the Senate , whose development we didn &apos;t want to have as much progress , so we were 15 .
We want to see the discoveries , the rocket companies , the big sections , that were used all over the world and in the U.S.
This is a moment of change in Galapagos .
There should be a sense of urgency for the people who grow up knowing their gender in the back of orthodoxy companies .
Have a voice , please raise your voice , and that &apos;s not good for the privilege we have .
Politicians need to acknowledge this problem , and promote a legitimate change in access to information .
We can aggregate this privilege ege ege ege that is responsible for the cutting and the calling for the candor .
CA : Welcome , Julie .
It &apos;s said that the Look , your invention , has made very much sense in the last few years that the rest of the media have been on .
Can it be true ?
Julie Singer : Yes , could it be true ?
This is a little bit of a query â€” isn &apos;t it ? â€” that the media of the world is showing just how bad a small group of workers can be able to post a small group of information that &apos;s more than all the media in the world .
CA : What is that like ?
How do people recruit ?
And how do you maintain their privacy ?
Julie Singer : There are â€” I can say it to you â€” public services in the right ways . And we have so many ways to get the information to us .
Therefore , we use a very high-speed storm survey to get materials from one place to the Internet , to clear away the signals to be used by law enforcement agencies like Sweden and Bolivia , because of these legal protections .
We get the information that &apos;s accumulated , through regular Doc , through Ramadan , through whatever , through regular news organizations , they format â€” which is sometimes very difficult , when you &apos;re talking about broader information for the public and then protecting yourself against the illegal logic and political will .
CA : So you have to try to make sure the document is true , but you actually never know what the tool is .
Julie Singer : It &apos;s true , we sometimes get this knowledge about it , and if we get to a stage when we get to the point , we just quickly dismiss the information .
( Cheers ) God loved it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s money , and I &apos;m just wondering what the code is , after TED . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s an example , real .
Here &apos;s something you invented a few years ago .
If we can see it up .
So that was the story of Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you found and then what happened ?
Julie Sangling : Yes , that &apos;s the report .
This was an FBI report that the Kenyan government was prepared for after the 2004 elections .
Already in 2004 , the government was in there for 18 years .
He was a notorious fan of Kenya .
And when it came to the power of the puppet â€” these seemingly simple tools that were trying to get the copy out of Canada â€” they put 20 million pounds of this report on the report and one on the report .
And then the government was sitting at it and using it for its political will , which was the wealthiest guy â€” now is the wealthiest guy in Kenya .
This is Jesus Christ for the press of Kenya .
This is why it was made in 2007 , and we were able to accomplish this by the very first election ever in September 2008 .
When we did that report , we decided three days after we had our new president , Kabul decided to become a friend from the person who was asking for the donor agencies , so that she became a report in the heart of the hospital .
CA : And so â€” I mean , just to mention this , this is â€” this was spread in Kenya , not from the provinces , but from the mean , and this is what has changed .
Julin Shanghai : Yes . This is the cloud of Gaddafi , and then it spread across the entire continent of Kenya , Tanzania and South Africa .
So it came in from the outside .
And he , a few days later , the Victorians actually believed that they could talk about it .
And that blog was put on the television for 20 days in Kenya , and it changed the equation 10 percent of the Violence Against , an online sex reporter , and it changed the result of that .
CA : Wow , so that &apos;s how your story really changed the world ?
Julin Sung : Yes .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : There we â€” we &apos;re just showing a little bit of a herd of blind tasting video .
This sequence is so long , but here &apos;s a little bit of a clip .
This â€” I &apos;ll let you know , this is a high-speed video .
Radio : ... bitterness , when you reach them , you touch them with two .
I found , uh-oh , there are four things with them .
The way is clear . Now it &apos;s okay . Galen is running .
When they &apos;re on your show , let me tell you . Go away .
Hi .
Go ! Go !
( Machine voice ) Gill running . Gill is running . ( Machine voice ) Gill is running .
Hatel â€” two great teachers , two great teachers .
We should move now , time is up !
Alrighty , we now killed eight people .
Here we &apos;re looking at two heels , and we &apos;re still running the cells .
Raleigh . They &apos;re on me .
Two six , that &apos;s two , we &apos;re on the grass .
Oh , wait a minute . What was going on ?
God bless you , Hillel . Okay . Yeah , I killed them .
CA : So what did that mean ?
Julie Sangling : People who worked on it had a very strong impact on it .
We finally did a couple of guys and I did some research on it .
It was the first of three times that this happened .
CA : So there were 11 people who died in that attack , right ?
Julian Sangling : Yes ! The two employees of the reserves , two little children were gone .
Together , it &apos;s about 26 out of 18 .
CA : And there was a lot of chutzpah after that .
What was the main reason you worry about it ?
Julian Sangling : I don &apos;t know , I think people can self-see the extraordinary inequality of power .
On the one hand , some people are going to the street , and then on the one kilometer , the U.S. Capitol starts filling out 30 miles of gallons of electricity â€” each and every one of them â€” and killing the refugees as parents .
There were two journalists who were no longer oppressed , because their jobs were journalists .
Chris Anderson : The U.S. intelligence agency was arrested by Broadway Manning , and it &apos;s said that he announced in Chester Rome that he took this video to you over 280,000 and a half thousand and and U.S. advisers as well .
Did it really happen ?
Julie Singer : So we decided to accept the doctrines .
The footprint was designed just five days ago , which is 150,000 papers and 50 cards .
But we &apos;ve gone back to doing that around the beginning of the year in Rajasthan and the U.S. Capitol , but it doesn &apos;t correlate .
I mean , I used to come to this safari room .
CA : I mean , I mean , if you &apos;ve got thousands of applications for the American safety family ...
Julie Singer : We &apos;ll carry them . ( CA : You &apos;re going to do it ? ) JF : Yeah . ( CA : Why ? ) JF : Because things like this show that what really , really is the military governments , are pushing human rights into these governments .
If you look at hidden documents like this , it &apos;s in them .
CA : They &apos;ve been playing with it .
I mean , normally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it that you reinforce hidden information ?
Julie Singer : Yes , the question is how important information the world is , what information can be made possible .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s a good indication that when you have to get the information out of the store , when you have to get the information out , you hope to do something good , because the institutions know it better , and they know the stories from the inside , they care about it .
And we found that in the experiment . And that &apos;s the history of press .
CA : But are there risks to an individual or a collective society , where there &apos;s an unexpected silver lining ?
Julie Singer : We didn &apos;t have the documents with them at all .
I mean we have a very big task .
So we can tackle information in a very specific way that is very personalized â€” there &apos;s information that &apos;s inspired by somebody else .
But there are a few paragraphs . For example , your doctor has your knowledge ; there &apos;s a magic secret â€” but we &apos;re talking about the public goods that are coming next to us and being grown up with enthusiasm .
CA : OK , so they do it vigorously .
And what you &apos;re going to say about it , for example , you think of the father , the son of a son in the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve made a difference that some people like to hire other people .
One of the things that consists of this is that there &apos;s a lot of Americans who die .
Which is â€” but it has made millions of people worldwide that the U.S. is a military enthusiasm .
Although they &apos;re not , my son isn &apos;t , who &apos;s going to be you to say ? So what &apos;s the answer ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we get asked many questions like this .
But remember in the abdomen , in Iraq , in Afghanistan â€” people don &apos;t have to watch a video , they watch it every day .
It does not correlate with their feelings , so it does not correlate with their perception .
Because they look at it every day .
It will change their frame and their thinking about why they pay all this money , and this is our hope .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re looking forward to what you think companies and governments are holding information .
That &apos;s good .
But wouldn &apos;t it be ridiculous to you that in order to have that light , do you have to have that kind of openness in your mind ?
Julie Singer : No . I mean , we &apos;re not a different cell .
We don &apos;t have the information that &apos;s surrounded by other minds .
If they do this , then we have a very difficult situation , but what we &apos;re doing is people &apos;s moral responsibility to find out whether they do this work or not .
CA : I &apos;m just wondering , we &apos;ve all heard that â€” this is going to be rewarded by the oppressed .
You might also realize that there will be various breakthroughs about the lions and the lions .
One is the hero of people who hope .
Or troubling .
What is the point of view of hero ?
And what about the problem ?
Julie Singer : Oh ! Something should be done .
CA : These are great people , Julie , very good .
We have to try and . Let &apos;s give them another example .
There &apos;s something you haven &apos;t noticed before , but I think you &apos;ve been doing it for TED .
There &apos;s a really interesting story , right ?
What is that ?
Julie Singer : This is a sample of what we do nearly every day .
Last year alone â€” in November , there were major breakthroughs in the bananas , as was in Mexico , but not as big .
And we got the report card â€” which was a very good analysis of this â€” which was that , in fact , conservation companies were very competent against different oil companies who stood there and sold them .
And it involved the Soviet government , etc .
And there was nothing on that report . That &apos;s why we had a very difficult time .
We couldn &apos;t predict it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote and what it was about .
So we were pretty suspicious that perhaps this company was doing this in a game of competition .
That &apos;s what we did , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , we don &apos;t know about it .
We certainly don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
That material is so good , and it seems right to see , but we can &apos;t make a guess . &quot; &quot; So we got a letter in the same week that this was written , and they wanted to take the tool out . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to take the tool out . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us about it .
What are you talking about ?
Can you show paper that you actually have owns of it ?
Is this real you ? Because they brought us this blind taste that we see on Scripture with the name of the microprocessor with the DNA .
Yes .
( Applause ) There it is .
This is our way of reading and reimagining what the material is , and this is to try to write and get the letter from these people .
CA : All right . So how long did you get the information from inside the BBC ?
Julie Singer : Yes , we have so much , I mean , at this time , we &apos;re accumulating and rewarding actions like difficult stages .
Our initiative to publish this has become invaluable in the last few months because we &apos;re optimizing our buck system because of the rare public goods that we have .
This is the water .
I mean , just like any organization that &apos;s spreading , our ability to connect more with us is because of our growth , and this means that we have access to a large number of public goods that are very smart , but we don &apos;t have as many people to organize and educate all that information .
CA : So that &apos;s the real problem , essentially , for a journalist or a journalist &apos;s dream ?
Julian Sangling : Yes . And brilliant people .
I mean we have an organization that is really hard to follow , because with the material that &apos;s accessible to us , we have to organize so that we can get people who have a very strong sense of how to do things for real conservation , and then have a very small footprint .
CA : OK , so you &apos;re going to tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got to work .
And I think where I &apos;ve learned that you went to 37 different schools as a child .
Is that true ?
Julian Sangling : Yes , my parents were in the movies business , and then they were moving away from the city , so that &apos;s why these two things had an impact .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean a psychologist , so what I mean by this is that everything can be done can be rendered powerful .
Julie Singer : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : And you â€” I mean , you were just a little bit of a hero , and you were kind of on the edge of a car search .
Julie Sung : Yes , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a journalist at a very young age .
I wrote a letter , and it was in that moment that I became fascinated with the crime .
So you need to appreciate the word and bring it to you .
I mean , there &apos;s a way â€” there &apos;s a way that can be used for different things .
Unfortunately , right now , it &apos;s only Rockefeller that &apos;s using the Rockefeller model to cover the bank of your grandmother .
That &apos;s why the word , now , is not as useful as it was before .
CA : Well , OK , I don &apos;t think that there &apos;s a Grandma Bank of your grandmother , but do you think that &apos;s your main value ?
Can you tell us something about what they are and perhaps one event in your life that helped them do ?
Julie Singer : I don &apos;t believe in facts .
But the basic values : good , good , wealthy people don &apos;t generate masters ; they prepare them .
And this is the lesson that I learned from my father and some other brilliant , aggressive people in my life .
CA : And brilliant , brilliant people don &apos;t generate masters ?
Julie Singer : Yes , and you know , I &apos;m a left-handed man , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m not so good at growing up , but somehow â€” there is another way to reach the corner , which is to get near the police , to crime .
And this is something that has been in my career for a very long time .
CA : So we have to just say this in a short time : What happened in the U.S.
Basically , you published something here , you &apos;ve got a problem with a bank , and then they gave the newspapers the horrific violence against their background .
Instead , they created a manifestation of your situation .
Which made you very famous in the West Bank . So what happened ?
Julie Singer : Yes , that &apos;s a great event . You know .
AIDS had a crisis .
He got the most powerful of it .
The bank had grown to 10 times the GDP of the rest of the country .
Well , we did that report last year in July .
And the National Taliban , five minutes before they get published , was like a movie : &quot; Unfortunately passed the press on Discovery , and the state of the press was , &quot; It never happened to us . What do we do ? &quot;
So we just showed the website , time-consuming all the time , and we became very popular in the Ice Landes , and I went to the Ice Lands and talked about this problem .
And the paradox of the people there was that it shouldn &apos;t be the same again , and as a result , the South Landers , working with some international experts , some international experts , we devised a new kind of Asian leadership law , so it was sort of like free media , the most safe place for journalists from all over the world , brand-new Neil prints for free .
A nation of the nation state is similar to a nation , which means that the system is heading up from the bottom .
And just a month ago , the Alliance Party sponsored this .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , judges .
When you look to the future , do you think they &apos;re more likely to outsource power and power , greater privacy , or see us as anything else , or is it just going to be the most ?
Julie Singer : I &apos;m not sure where the situation will be .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot more pressure to be made to correlate the laws of free demand and and the laws of transparency , all over the world â€” in Europe , in China and the U.S.
What &apos;s that got to do ? It &apos;s hard to say .
And so it &apos;s a really interesting time to live â€” because with a small attempt , we can move past it or move past it .
CA : OK , so it seems that I was translating the character of the audience into what they call , the judges , with respect , and all the power to you .
Julie Sung : Thank you , thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
When I was a child .
So that was my team .
( Laughter ) I was pretty good at the toy .
I don &apos;t like to play and watch .
So I did this , which is a milk cake .
I used to take off my kid &apos;s cocktail bills , and I would see him carefully in the kitchen .
When I went to college and went back to the early &apos; 90s , I found this .
My team crossed .
And when I looked at it from the perspective of a mirror , I suddenly realized , how do the rest of the world think about it ?
And when I went to church in the bush I knew where I &apos;d come from , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , or India , I &apos;d seen photos of all four creatures being dispersed across the ice â€” cold , cold , silence and code .
And I thought that was kind of strange , and I was wondering if anyone else had this notebook of a mockingbird .
And when I went to visit him , I realized that people are not looking at their canaries .
ordinary people see something like this .
Deciphering the natural world with a few elements is not an unusual human character .
That &apos;s what we did 10,000 years ago when we took care of our ancestors .
If you look at the fire from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s ranking and propagating , you &apos;ll see all the creatures you see .
But if you look back to the year 2000 , you &apos;ll see just four animals : corn , coal , alcohol and drug .
It is also true for the elders .
You look at the New York City &apos;s paths , 150 years ago , or 200 years ago , at the Smithsonian Natural Current , and you look at the oean paths .
But if you look at the remoteness of the present , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re only going to be able to get four floors â€” the turtle , the turtle , but also the turtle .
It &apos;s understanding that we &apos;re moving in this direction .
How did that happen to us ?
Shaheen .
This is a brand new problem .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing over the last 50 years .
World War II , we were given the most inspiration to become the warrior .
In the middle of the Great War , we developed a technology called Shanghai , Kallikuppam , or Huxley , where all of these things were lost .
And since the end of the Second World War , we have seen the dramatic increase in the capacity of catastrophes .
But that &apos;s only half the story .
The second half of the story is that the increased well-being in armed farming and marine farming , and for the last two years , its birth rate has increased from aggression .
Now , if you put all the forest flows and forest into this , it will be equal to two Chinese children per year from the sea .
Now , this isn &apos;t a coincidence to use my Chinese countertopic , because China is not only the largest country , it &apos;s also the largest movement .
So now we turn to our four choices .
The first is the most commonly used salt in the U.S. and the West .
In the wild , it &apos;s a critical source .
All you need is a pump of Delhi to get to the market for five , 10 , or 15 pounds-worth of Gaddafi .
In fact , even the Indus Valley is an unbelievable honor .
In a study done in the Dutch University , it showed that dealing with lakes of oil is a very ineffective use of carbon .
But here &apos;s the problem .
Where the ranks of lions in the forest are the forests of Mongolia .
Take a look at these beautiful images .
They detect the Earth &apos;s atmosphere from their place , protecting the beaches , cleaning and sedimenting children , all sorts of important things to the atmosphere .
Well , that &apos;s what happened with the forests of New England .
We &apos;ve lost millions of icons in the last 30 or 40 years .
There &apos;s a second process that &apos;s going on here , that &apos;s what the Philippines call &quot; &quot; the Nemo Cloud . &quot; &quot; So you &apos;ve just seen a little bit of the Trojan River , which is very controversial .
Today , what &apos;s happening is that the leather is hitting the reservoirs , but with it , with so much of the other mosquitos , they will shrink from the rest of the food they feed them .
And most of the time , it &apos;s working with the slums that are named after the Reddit fish , which is the slum that we &apos;d like to see on the river , which means that the ecosystem is harvesting its food , and it &apos;s making its way out to the waste .
Then to America and the West , we have to grow a second big food .
Titan is a global icon .
Tunisia needs to take a very large approach to organizing this facility .
We also have a region called the ICCAT â€” the ICCAT â€” for International Security Council .
And the great reading for all of this , of course , was the reading .
We can walk across the board of Taiwan , but there is no good lesson for Taiwan .
Many people don &apos;t know , but Tony &apos;s got a warm blood .
He can take over 40 miles an hour , and he can put his body temperature at over 20 degrees Celsius .
So almost all the money for this fish ends .
The circulatory system has a large amount of blood flow that doesn &apos;t slow down very quickly .
This is the best for protein .
But the only creature that survives 40 miles of bare count is not able to stay in the forest .
Same thing is a good slow , not necessarily a bad slow .
This is my own political connectome .
The connectome was outside the forest .
If you look at a map of the connectome , there &apos;s a document .
In the state of Connect , there are 3,000 of them .
In fact , I &apos;m just saying that there &apos;s more people in the connect â€” ( Laughter ) if someone is open to the power of a connectome , I think we can make the world a better place .
And everywhere , these are the rockets that discourage the rest of their children from that facility .
As a result , we have a successful breakthrough for the community and for the Familia .
When the shelter started , Sonoma was spending six pounds of forest to make a ball of Sonoma .
But now it &apos;s much better .
Now , this turns out to be a little bit wrong , because if you think about FedEx , they name the Shanghai FedEx for a second .
This is FedEx is trained as bait .
It &apos;s hard to say something about chocolate and chocolate .
But there &apos;s also the whole market mechanism that talks about getting the copy behind a marketing campaign .
This is a system that &apos;s producing cooking , which is gasoline sequestering .
This is seven percent a year .
Although we are spending a little bit less money on getting to the market , we are also spending a lot of money on it .
We don &apos;t just grow old mosquitos , we also grow old mosquitos and vegetables .
We have what &apos;s growing leather and also seeds that are being produced .
Because of the blood vessels and the blood vessels and so on , they pay the tubes .
I wonder if there &apos;s a mosquito that fills , but it clears the mud .
India is the first or the first one . ( Laughter ) The result is a terrible problem .
We &apos;re talking already about 30 million tons of desalination brine that &apos;s being used in the sea .
That &apos;s the third piece of China or the entire U.S. , which is how human beings go out of the sea every year .
The last thing in four categories is this .
Philadelphia literally started as a liver .
And it started to look like a local entrepreneur who had just noticed that on a Friday afternoon , he was never in the mainstream .
He went to the park and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a funeral for you . &quot;
Let &apos;s find out .
The extra money that the Sun would spend more time in the sea was evidence that Hello would not win .
So he made his own lifetime funds .
Unfortunately , the pension was in 30 centuries .
He wanted to create a 25-centimeter cylinder , so he brought the entire electronic code .
This entrepreneurial Polaroid in the United States is the largest mass-world art industry in the United States , 23 billion pounds a year away from the sea .
If we stopped the police , the alternative candidates would be Philadelphia .
Twenty years ago , nobody knew Tamil .
It changes the plant proteins in vitro proteins in a very dynamic way , and this turns out to be the third world .
Actually , this is a very sustainable solution ; in nine months it &apos;s an adult .
The trouble is , when you look at the West , it &apos;s not what the West wants .
It doesn &apos;t look like a mockingbird .
This includes iPods and DNA , which we think will save us all the time .
So what do we do ?
I mean , this poor little clip .
This represents the large sample of 20 million tons .
One possibility that conservation community raised is , can we eat it ?
Can we just encompass it ?
There &apos;s reasons for that .
They have a wonderful childhood when you go to the market and compare it to a liar &apos;s head , and the effect that insulin is at the very top .
It &apos;s October 3 , the EPA and the CDC .
So here &apos;s his potential .
But what if we took this path and instead of paying a few bucks to Pune , or Pune , and we turned it into a Facebook , and we hired the leather back and we paid the goods to pay the bill for two bucks ?
The second thing that &apos;s really interesting is the personal character .
There &apos;s a lot more EPACs and DNA than others .
The Indus calculus is incredibly effective .
The net charge on a market is only three parts of the culprits in meat .
Actually , about three are not showing up from the kitchen .
sea level rises by three , so it just collects them in the lake .
On top of that , it &apos;s incredibly important .
In our West , however , has been blamed for using Facebook and analytics .
Over the past 20 years , more than 400 dead people have been born , this is why the oceans die .
So as you might imagine with a computer , there are more than three protons in all these different ways , and they &apos;re very effective .
It &apos;s absolutely true .
And finally , the puzzle is a question mark .
We can produce a lesson that can be really useful for ocean protein .
These creatures must be a green saber , fast-forward and evolved environments in their own right , sort of like the EPA , the DHA , OMED .
It &apos;s still in the paper .
I &apos;ve been replicating these topics for the last 15 years .
Whenever I do that , nobody says to me , &quot; &quot; We can do that . We can do that .
But he &apos;s not trying to be .
And now it &apos;s time to try .
If we did that , the third part of the world &apos;s population is around 30 million in the sea .
I mean , it &apos;s all going on .
We want to think differently about what we don &apos;t need .
But if we did something like that , the problem would be a little crazy .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was in a big way to reach the brain because I have a brother who &apos;s a neurological illness diarrhea .
Growing up and then I wanted to understand as a scientist , how can I connect my dreams to my own reality and make my own dreams ?
With my brother &apos;s brain and schizophrenia , what &apos;s happening is that they don &apos;t dive down their dreams in a common way and that they do their job .
So I quit my life to study serious illness .
And I moved to Boston from my wife &apos;s office in India , where I worked at the President Francesca Bank &apos;s lab at Harvard Media Collaboratory .
So what was the difference in the brain of people who were looking for answers , on a biological basis , than in the brain of people who were typically imagined , versus people who were in the Scottish community or in the Pythagoras Desert ? So what we were actually trying to do is make a map of the brain &apos;s micro-controllers , whose cells are sending the message , the &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the
So there was a lot of privilege in my life because I was doing this research in the day , but on a Saturday and a Saturday afternoon , I visited the United Nations as a trip to these monthly nations .
But on September 10th , 1996 , I wanted to find out that I was faced with an intellectual adventure .
The lower left of my brain was a nine-way street .
And for the next four hours , I watched my brain become completely unaware of any information .
This morning I was able to read and write and remember something .
I was a young child in the body of a woman .
If you have ever seen the same brain , there are two parts of it that are completely different from each other .
I &apos;ve brought a human brain to play with you .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a real human brain .
This is the last part of the brain that touches the left side of the brain along the outsides of the brain , and it sort of stays in my head .
And when you look at the brain , you &apos;ll see two parts of the brain are completely identical to each other .
So those of you who think about computers , the right part of our brain , operates like a parallel processor , whereas the left part of our brain acts like a serial processor .
These two pieces are each other sending messages to each other through the culture of the Koran , which is covering 300 explosives of profits .
But they &apos;re also identical to the two .
Because they understand information in a different way , the knowledge of each part has to understand the knowledge of the different things , and if you allow me to let go , my identities are very different from each other .
There you go . Thank you . There you go .
SOC : Well done .
( Laughter ) The only part of our brain is thinking about this moment .
Right now , part of our brain is thinking of compartmentally in images of our brain , and it &apos;s thinking about tissues in our body .
Information is shaped down in the form of electrical activity , and it is shaped up in the body through our whole nervous system , and then it is shaped down in the form of a great Islamic class , which , at the moment in time , tells us how to feel and how to feel in the mind .
I &apos;m a part of the brain that &apos;s obsessed with the energy surrounding him with the right brain .
We &apos;re the energy systems that are connected from each other through the perception of the right part of the brain , as a human family .
And at that time , we are brothers from this planet who are responsible for making this world a better place .
And in that moment , we are the most beautiful and beautiful .
The left part of our brain is a completely different place .
The left part of our brain is thinking scientifically and scientifically .
The fabric of our brain is also about the past and the future .
The building on the left of the brain is also showing us that we take the largest Islamic Olympics of our time , and then we begin to look at the analysis and then we begin to look at the diagnosis .
And it also informs all of this information about organization and place , and it shapes all of the things that we &apos;ve learned in the past that we &apos;ve learned and the possibilities of the future , which is to justify the impact on our plans .
The left-hand part of our brain is thinking of the linguistic script .
It &apos;s this continuous debate that has driven us and our inner world from the outside .
It &apos;s that little voice that tells me that , &quot; &quot; Hey , you have to remember to go home and buy a car .
I &apos;ll need them in the morning , so it &apos;s a very awareness of me creating a book that reminds me of where I &apos;m going to go .
But perhaps the most important voice is the voice she says ! I am !
And the way that my right brain says to me , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; I am isolated .
I become the only truth in the world with the energy in the world around you and with you .
That same part of my brain that morning happened without the pollution .
The morning of the assaults , my left eye in the back of my eye , with a deep pain .
It was as traumatic as the wound of the Easy-Bake Oven .
And that pain is what drove me and left me .
He leaves , he leaves .
For me , it was an unusual thing that I had never had any pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t start my own routine job . &quot; &quot; So I went and I put on my skull and I put on my card billboard , which is a body development machine .
Now , I &apos;m obsessed with this device , and it feels like I &apos;m holding a finger in the palm of an early man who touched the donor .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; This is such an anomaly , &quot; &quot; and then I look at my body and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is such an unusual , unusual thing . &quot; &quot; And it seemed like the way I had changed my mind , which is really a public sensation in which I &apos;m a person who &apos;s been performing out of this experience , but now I was a visceral place where my conscious@@
And it was all very strange , and I had a spine going up .
So I got out of the machine and I started walking through the room and I realized that everything was going on in my body .
And everybody thinks that it &apos;s very difficult and very thinkable .
I have no relationship at all , and I think there &apos;s a home that &apos;s really only focused on the intrinsic system .
I &apos;m standing in my vagina ready to go underneath the water , and I &apos;m really listening to a conversation within my body .
I made a voice that says , &quot; &quot; I have to touch you now .
Yes , my foot goes down , and then I don &apos;t have to balance myself , I just grab hold of the wall .
I look around and I look at my hand , and I realize that I can &apos;t right now modify my body &apos;s waste .
I have no idea where I &apos;m going to start and where I &apos;m going to stop , because my hand is held up with the atom and the magnetic wall of my hand .
If I was understanding something , it was energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; What &apos;s the problem with me ? &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And at that moment in my brain that &apos;s absolutely silent .
It was like someone was speaking to the TV on a regular monitor .
A silver lining .
Once upon a time , I was blown away by the machinery of my brain .
But then immediately , I got the energy in this huge umbrella of air around me .
And because I couldn &apos;t understand the boundaries of my body now , I felt my great sense of urgency and my strong sense of urgency .
I felt a part of that energy that was so beautiful .
And then one of the first things that happened was the part of my brain , and he said to me , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re a member of a problem . &quot;
We should help them , and I told myself that I &apos;m really in charge of any problem . ( Laughter ) It seems like I &apos;m really in charge of a problem , but I came back immediately in the same consciousness that I talk about a lot of money .
But it was such a beautiful place .
Look how beautiful it is in a place where you are totally interconnected with this tiny brain that connects you with the outside world .
So I &apos;m in this vicious cycle where my work and my stress level goes on .
I felt a lot of shake in my body .
And look , all of your relationships from the outside world , and from that , there was some depression .
And I felt a sense of peace and mercy .
And measure what it would look like if you were staying behind this 70-year-old emotional load that you stood up .
( Laughter ) Oh , I was like a millionaire .
It was beautiful .
Then my brain went down to the left of my brain and said , &quot; &quot; Oh , come on .
We need someone , and I &apos;m thinking I should help me be proud of it , so I went from the rich home and I put a machine gun in my yard , and now I &apos;m thinking , can I drive a car ? &quot; &quot; And this moment , my hands are completely wide open .
It was then that it occurred to me that my God was going to attack me , the first thing that my mind tells me is how magnificent this is .
( Laughter ) What a gift !
Some brain scientists are going to have this opportunity to recall that they can awake their own brains and that they can go in there . ( Laughter ) Then one day came to my mind . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very popular woman â€” ( Laughter ) I have no time to relax . &quot; &quot; So I thought .
&quot; &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop a flight , but in a couple of weeks , I &apos;ll get back to my normal . Okay .
I have to get a phone call to help me . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t remember my work , and then I remembered that I had a Business card with my phone number .
So I go into my studio and I spend a third and a half second-grade essays building .
And I &apos;m looking at the top card , even though I can see from my naked eyes what my business card looks like , but I can &apos;t tell you it &apos;s a card I don &apos;t know , because I can &apos;t see any of the red dots around me .
And the words on those pad are going to be helpful by the maps and the marks , and I was not reading anything .
So I started waiting for what I call the bubble gum .
And at that moment , the normal truth was repeated , and I was learning that this is not a card ; this is not a card .
It took me about 45 minutes to finish this box with only one inch .
And in those 45 minutes , the effects of the pollution was on the lower left .
I don &apos;t know the number . I don &apos;t know the phone , but I have no way .
So I take the phone , and I plug it in there .
I picked up the Bismarck , and I put it there , and now I &apos;m going to look at the cards as these big , wiki girls get on the phone .
But then I head for my own elite when I came back , and I didn &apos;t remember I &apos;d gotten that number , I didn &apos;t know .
So I took my fucking old hand like a dog and stuck it on the floor , and then I put the other hand pressing these buttons that when I get back to the normal truth , I can tell you that I had just come back from India and finally came out with all the India , and I heard that one of the guys on the phone was picking up the phone and saying , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter
So when I say this in my mind , I &apos;m speaking , &quot; I need help . &quot;
And for me , the voice says something like this , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; And I think , &quot; &quot; Oh my god , I &apos;m speaking like the Golden Rule . &quot; &quot; So I found that I didn &apos;t know that I could speak a language and I didn &apos;t understand language until I tried to .
So he understood that I needed help and he robbed me .
Shortly after I walked into an ambulance with all sorts of other mosquitos running around Boston on a hospital .
I walked down and it looked like a child from a small step .
Just like the one story in which the rest of the herd had fallen out of the bank , I pulled the energy out and I realized just how hurt I was .
And it was then that I realized that I was no longer in charge of my life .
Or perhaps my doctor has saved me and offers me a second life or a moment of transition .
When I went to visit him , I was shocked to learn that I still survive .
When I felt really in shock of my soul , then I said life to God .
Now my brain has gone through a vicious cycle between two facts .
The emotions started to come from my conscious system , which was only in the case of pain .
Light rushed my brain , like the fire in the forest , and the ears were so close and so strong that I could barely hear a voice from the hole in the ground , or from the ground up , and I was just peddling further down my way .
Because I wasn &apos;t able to diagnose my body in the mirror , so I felt really superior and deeply in a way that had been liberated from my belly .
And my spirit has been unleashed , like a giant elephant in the sea of silence .
Great heaven .
I &apos;ve found the capacity for well-being .
And I was reminded of that , and I was thinking that it would never be possible that I would discover my great desire to reach beyond the small attributes of my body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m also alive ! &quot;
I &apos;m still alive , and I &apos;ve been incarcerated .
And if I have been blamed , and I still live , then whatever life is capable of gaining sleep , I have seen a world filled with beauty , fraternity , compassion and love , people who know they can someday feel this quality .
And they can be chosen to find out when they actually want to take their way to the left of their brain and find out what that transcendent quality looks like .
And then I understood how this experiment could be a gift of what it was like to be a chef in cigarettes that taught me how to live my life .
And it inspired me to be healthy .
After a period of half-heartedness , the south center of my brain spilled a large amount of blood vessels that were monitoring the brain &apos;s poor performance .
I &apos;m here with my mom , who &apos;s a real fan of my life .
It took me eight years to complete health .
So who are we then ?
We are the real power of life .
And we have the power to choose for a moment in this world who we are and what we want to be .
It &apos;s a place where I can step into the right part of my consciousness where we are .
I am the power of life in the universe .
Fifty beautiful cells are made up of organic , semi-circulatory cells , one that is all in them .
Or I can choose to step to the left of my consciousness where I become an individual in a trivial way .
From the knee to the knee .
I &apos;m a doctor , a neuroanatomist .
Inside me , we are .
Who would you choose ?
Who do you choose ?
And when ?
I think the more time we spend on our right brain conducting electricity , the more we put peace in this world and the more we make our planet so safe .
And I thought that was worth reading this .
Thank you .

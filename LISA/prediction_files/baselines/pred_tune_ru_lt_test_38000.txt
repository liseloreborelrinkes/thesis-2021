These years , there will be plenty of people who have actively new social networks .
The only thing that all these people have made is they &apos;re all going to die .
And while it may be quite a profound thought , I think it has this deep resource that &apos;s worth questioning .
And so what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to buy about it , it &apos;s something that &apos;s happened to me , and it &apos;s something that has been learned and learned from the grave , and it &apos;s been written earlier this year .
And what Mr. has done is they have made their daughters and their friends that they will write a video that will come right after him died .
This is what he wrote as a bill .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , I &apos;m dead , and this is my next one .
And early on , I realized that when my legs finally disappear from my grave , the ears that my clothes and my friends published this message that I wrote — like the first part of the article to the archive . &quot; &quot; Well , while he was magazine , Mr. Carta would be the apartment of the apartment of the apartment and the hell of a college than many , but in fact , all of us in
Think about it .
There &apos;s still hours of video on YouTube every minute .
200 billion &quot; &quot; Tom &quot; &quot; is sent every day .
And the user of Facebook will build 90 different parts per month .
So when you support your strength with the elderly , the better that they could build , these are some hand-drawn images and images of homes , or a distraction that now lives in a box .
But these days , we &apos;re all creating a hotline for a rich weekend archive that will live on a &quot; &quot; unlimited time , &quot; &quot; a year of experience when you &apos;re not here .
And I think that &apos;s going to cheat some of the unfounded possibilities of the young .
But also , to be honest , I &apos;m a magazine , not the people I want to briefly do , it &apos;s to give you a picture of how the future is coming and coming .
We &apos;ve already been there a couple of lectures out there that are created for us to decide what &apos;s going to happen to our movie and our social media after death .
All of them , the true narrative , quite similar to me , after I put myself in a New York restaurant in Foursburg .
( Video ) Audience : Al .
They said , &quot; &quot; Yeah ?
AO : Yeah .
So here &apos;s the thing : Things can get you anywhere , but even organs in restaurant .
AO : What &apos;s going on here ?
( Laughter ) I &apos;m an iPhediot , even though it &apos;s still there .
( Laughter ) WK : How boring is that ?
So what this postcard suggests , by the way , is that they &apos;re going to encourage you to make a text message that can be published at Facebook when you die .
His service calls for compassion .
And what she &apos;s about to do to you is to create an inner dwarf for her loved ones , with the photos , the videos and the stories that they can publish after you die .
But what happens after that , I think , is deeply interested .
Many of you will know Deb Rock , who said that he could save more than a thousand hours at home .
I think that while we have the capacity to understand people &apos;s language and appreciate the vast majority of the medium of the medium , the ultimate sacrifice of anyone &apos;s life will be possible — &quot; &quot; Tony , &quot; &quot; the notes , the videos , the signs of the input — the signs that we &apos;re making right now , the big numbers .
I think what &apos;s going to happen is it &apos;s going to be possible that our weekends , the limits of the week , have been able to communicate with the real world , after we die , that will not be enough to support the amount of wealth that we have , to create and to do so with content .
We could already have them in this area .
Things like this , &quot; &quot; The other Tom &quot; &quot; promises your entire Twitter story , all you &apos;ve ever published on Twitter to make predictions of what you might have told in your other text .
Well now , as you can see , there can be a comeback .
But you can visualize how something will be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be about 5.10 or 20 years later when our technology sets up .
Last step further , the Chinese classroom operates for robots that communicate more like people .
But what would it be that these robots could generate by the end of a particular person &apos;s characteristics , by the end of the spectrum of those rich particles , that humans have created in their lives ?
And then finally , consider this famous scene and the markets in the same place , where CNN is directly transmitted to i.m. — hip , you know , doing all of this for yourself , specifically with Cooper .
What we can do is we can bring the same circumstances of our loved ones and translate them into our own circumstances — and together with a very similar lifestyle , based on the entire content , created by the person before they were still there .
I think it can be absolutely possible because of the power of mean , the power of the new , and the capacity to understand it , and the war will expand .
By the way , I think we all need help , or we want it to become real — and it will become what it means to be in terms of living and everything that happens after life .
That &apos;s very good for you .

People will come into the workshop after a generation of reviews — the title of &quot; &quot; lateral &quot; &quot; is called .
These are the people who have made the crossword puzzle to encourage the men who have grown up , to provide the asymmetries for the arts , or the health of the arts .
And there are all these generations of this , and all the time , the soldiers , the soldiers , the pensioners , going back into the office , argue to the threat of the threat of peace .
Growing up in the workshop after a war is hard because of loss of coffee and restaurants .
The employees decode the people &apos;s minds of their lives in a sense of how a design is , and the assumptions that are doing over the war can doubt about their potential to regenerate their generation , especially if they don &apos;t have time .
And that &apos;s the kind of thing I &apos;m trying to help solve .
The &quot; &quot; restaurants &quot; &quot; is everywhere and every field .
This is Sami Kafa .
He is the energy of the generic power of the United States , a king that doesn &apos;t work for five years to be home with his five years .
And the press recently wrote about the nurses , putting themselves into the workshop after they got there .
They &apos;re going to be about the generation of peace , the Me .
She is a social worker in her Ordan apartment that threatens the work of social services after 25 years .
It &apos;s a long-term cross-pollination for me .
The oldest rule of thumb is that Say Day O O &apos;Congo didn &apos;t work five years of its own war .
And this is the Shephelah who didn &apos;t last 13 years .
And they brought it back to the &quot; &quot; Hey Show &quot; &quot; location of the Sabbath , which was a place for people who tried to bring back to it , but they were tough .
And he said that there are five lifespans that need to be in the house , but after the bypass , she really wanted to bring back the work , because she was comfortable working .
They did what many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve done everything we want to do .
She &apos;s looking for finance arms for buffaler work and losing the last nine months of examined by companies , and he &apos;s dedicated to jobs without kidnapping .
I met the 20th anniversary of the 20th anniversary of &quot; &quot; Hey Show &quot; &quot; and asked if I could work with her to see if I could see something up there .
I used to tell you that she had to leave the house .
I told myself that she had access to all of us to work and to tell all the strangers that she wanted to get into the work .
And I also said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got a lot of conversations that you &apos;ve never seen before .
That &apos;s what keeps happening .
There are only those who are finally going to be the capability . &quot; &quot; I was going to talk to you about what happened to me , but now I want to share the invention , I did something to do when I was trying to get in the workshop after 11 years of peace .
People &apos;s attitude to that is a stopping laser .
I mean , when you try to connect with people from their past , people who work with , or coffee with , they &apos;re going to be mentoring , they &apos;re going to be giving us what the hell they want to be .
And even if you think of yourself as being aware of the amount of time , what I &apos;m doing with so many of us who are far away from our profession is coming out .
For example , you might be thinking of yourself as something that comes back like this .
Chai , I waited after a day to go for my own voice .
Or I &apos;m on the inside .
But these people at the beginning , they didn &apos;t promise anything about it .
They only take what you &apos;re applying for , and it &apos;s a great incentive to yourself that you connect with these people and you hear their range because you want to go back to work .
They &apos;re all remembered from their generation of deaf peoples .
And it was that I didn &apos;t make news at all .
Our range is funding , and I &apos;ve done a lot of good news when I was growing up in the house with my little dreams .
So it &apos;s like I &apos;m going to start talking about companies that are not there .
So I came up with this new version of &quot; &quot; The Journal &quot; &quot; and I was going to wear it for a good month , from the beginning to the end , until I realized that what was happening in business .
It &apos;s because the &quot; &quot; Recent &quot; &quot; is a work of force for expensive , for that .
We &apos;ve had a stutter of laughter or some of the things that are going on .
We live a life of seeds .
You have a great job .
You &apos;ve got the most expensive activity .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves a hat .
And besides , we have the energy , and we want to bring it back to the workshop precisely because we didn &apos;t waste it any time .
And on the other hand , when I talk to the employees , there are two concepts of what they &apos;re doing to make the labor report .
First of all , employees are anxious that the &quot; &quot; Recent &quot; &quot; is a distinct from themselves .
I can tell you , I &apos;ve been blind when I &apos;m weakened , it &apos;s just a condition .
I was doing funding so long that I was doing the Latin 2 3 .
I don &apos;t know if any other kind of program we &apos;re going to take , but I &apos;m going to get it from a new kind of Excuse .
In fact , it wasn &apos;t very hard . A lot of teams are identical .
The PowerPoint was a bigger challenge , but I &apos;m now bringing it all the time .
I said , &quot; &quot; Recording , &quot; &quot; that the employees believe that they will come to work with the basic budget for governance policy .
And if they &apos;re separate , then that &apos;s their response to that .
And they do .
The second job worker worried about &quot; &quot; restaurants , &quot; &quot; that they didn &apos;t worry about &quot; &quot; The Green &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t know what they wanted to do .
I said , &quot; &quot; Recording , &quot; &quot; that the news is that you need to make good work and determine whether or not they have the skills or not , but they have been the transition .
It &apos;s not a job job .
This is a restaurant saying that you can sell to a employee what the hell you can give it .
That &apos;s what I started to do .
I followed the curriculum since 2009 , and by 20s , I started getting myself a little bit of a taxation of work , whether it was called a stamp or not , but it was a state-of-the-art advice as a way to get the job .
I &apos;ve seen , as &quot; &quot; Dr. Sachs &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Show Lee &quot; &quot; started a general routine application program .
I &apos;ve seen as a threat to infect people , despite the limits of their inscriptions , with the dates of their dates , with the curriculum of the status quo , and after that , there &apos;s a recurring job .
I saw two layers preparing for stadiums in the middle of a routine passing program .
So I wrote a story about what I saw , and it turned into a magazine called &quot; &quot; Business Review , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; 40 years of staff . &quot; &quot; I want to help you with the actors behind the addition , just outside this illustration , where you see a 40-year-old stadium in a magazine .
And then , with &quot; &quot; Dr. Business News , &quot; &quot; they called &quot; &quot; The Year of the Year of the Year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And with any of the biggest funding facilities , they have a rare recordings of the building blocks for funding funds .
This brings you to all parts of it .
These are recordings being paid , and people who are transferred to permanent identities are devastating .
More than any of the great engineering firms , they are bringing together a series of statistical projects to get them to be able to identify with people as part of the war with the Global Index .
What are companies choosing record ?
Because the staff says that the employees are engaged in making sure that they &apos;re doing things for themselves , instead of engaging in conversations , and the employees don &apos;t have to accept the permanent assignment of making a statement until the statue is not perfect .
This period of intervention replaces the numberical target , which is what the CEOs are doing , which is they &apos;re looking at the Great Leader , and they &apos;re looking at the wonderful data that &apos;s behind the specimen .
Think how many of us have accomplished .
It didn &apos;t have a lot of restaurants to do it all the time .
But now , not only are programmers specifically designed for the past , but they also need to share it if they don &apos;t solve their lives .
It &apos;s a real change , a real institutional change , because if we can solve this &quot; &quot; restaurant &quot; &quot; thing , we can solve it for others , for generations .
In fact , one of the employees told me that their passion for herself was based on the edge of their building .
And there &apos;s no joke about it , so they should be retirement statistics .
It &apos;s the area that &apos;s wired .
So what happened to this guy is Sir .
Remember , she had to tell all the strangers that she wanted to go back to work .
Well , one important thing to do with this tension of her limitations was to do a tendency for her , and that was the bureaucracy of her funding .
But it was a time job .
A company told her that there was a possibility that it would be something more than that , but it would be a little bit more rewarded .
This was the 20th Street .
They had their own company and their own company , and they were more afraid than 10 minutes before their house .
And even though she had the second job offer at another company to work on a permanent cycle , she would not be able to put this station and hope for the best .
Well , she covers all their expectations , and not only did the company offer them a recurrent job in the 20th floor , but made it interested in and educate them because she knew what she could do .
And by 20th , he was angry .
They paid her magicians for it .
She even launched another restaurant to work .
They had a tendency in their careers , just like a staff , and that was scratching up for them at the same time as a shop .
The goal of this is to discover the limits of the statistics of the staff .
But whereas if you &apos;re going to go back to work after a generation of reviews , you &apos;d expect to offer a staff or a staff or a stadium for a wedding dealer who doesn &apos;t even have an exclusive reference for building .
Hold the first slavery on this , and you can become the first person to come to the restaurant .
Thanks .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you about unlimited discovery .
There &apos;s still work within the industry of the line .
And my little startup — oh , this is a new company — is trying to confirm that view into a new way .
A new mindset of ideas for me .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we remain .
You &apos;re on your way .
They &apos;re a little bit of a delay of what they &apos;re doing .
( Laughter ) We could — we could literally literally make sense — I &apos;ll use the video — ( Laughter )
( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Honk ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
High energy is ...
Oh , that &apos;s my time ?
Okay . That &apos;s right .
( Applause )
The second is from the oldest .
The answer is yes .
And then , it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done .
So what do we know about this immense ?
So clearly , all of this is — there are more parts of it .
Where are these networks ?
What we looked at very carefully was the web of the web .
And we also have a set of identities .
How do they organize ? Will they reveal , without owning it ?
These are things that lead more than one country , and we &apos;re 43,000 .
Let me highlight this to you by giving you a letter .
Sweet . The tender is to look at eight of our projects , the generation of the Danish Arts in Sasha .
We call ourselves &quot; &quot; Dad Ice &quot; &quot; and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with the very first thing that I did , which was called &quot; &quot; The Great Leader . &quot; &quot; It was summarized by my uncle , and I would constantly expect someone to come upon him , sort of , like , be his knee going , like , &quot; &quot; Embrace a bicycle or bring him a sterile of water , ripples .
As I grew up , his mind grew stronger , and I started to look at it as a form of shape .
But of course , I had to say nothing to you , because the box was good in the heart of the music .
And what driven me , and the train behind , was his new way of doing the latrine .
He would lay down his eyebrow , and he would expect that I would find a number behind him .
So as a response and an anonymity , I &apos;m setting up &quot; &quot; The Great Come . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s so much that two people have two people .
It &apos;s just like my new lady was built for one person .
While I held home and decided to laugh for it , I was able to push his magazines .
So , when I gave him the email of the email , he was able to send his magazines to his son &apos;s house and give them to all the world &apos;s email .
All he had to do was to take a sheet of paper , put it in a wheelchair , print his own behavior , laser and irreverence , and get a poker out .
This is the automatic sending messages to the untouchable aspect .
You can see that we &apos;ve made companies so much of this that we can understand the mechanical characteristics and invite them into clouds .
So my uncle works with the machinery .
And , of course , the song had to be extremely visible and captured by the north of my uncle , as my uncle liked .
The second thing we do is we feel an installation that we love to call &quot; &quot; The Guests . &quot; &quot; We wanted to develop the idle so that we &apos;re surrounded by a very courageous , sensitive and lovely creature of genes .
This is how it works : we bring hair on the walls , and behind them , it lends .
And once everything sticks in , they sort of shout out out out .
And they &apos;re quiet , they &apos;re going to define themselves .
And from the smallest sound , they &apos;re going to turn away .
So we &apos;ve taken these hair up on three rooms .
And we &apos;ve hidden over 500 items down there .
This is how it turns out .
It &apos;s a video feed .
Once you get to the study , they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re out of lunch .
They heard things like people or other real creatures .
So for them , they will come back to their frightened sound .
In the same way , they don &apos;t touch the sound .
You &apos;ll be hearing a Chinese , they don &apos;t talk to each other .
( Honk ) But they go to the first cloud . I had to hear that .
( Whistling ) We were really trying to make it as a living .
So everybody thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , my grandfather , I guess , I &apos;ve had some lumps , etc . , etc .
That &apos;s one of the first ones .
And of course , I drank it well .
We made it possible to go to people , but we believed that people in front of them became a fireplace and an exit .
This is a video installation that says , &quot; &quot; The Bloody Man . &quot; &quot; We were very consistent with the grade of empowerment that we had .
How can you feel the feeling that you are ?
So we &apos;ve been collaborating with this , from this point of view , from this point of view , from this campaign , from scratch , from scratch , from scratch , so that you can follow people in the room and get one of them out of the room , to do that for me .
And I &apos;m going to show you one of the first ones .
On the right-hand side , you see my own Show , which is in this space .
And on the side , you can see a clip of a video that &apos;s been stuck with it .
He gets in the room . He &apos;s there ! He &apos;s there .
And you see that it &apos;s successful and it &apos;s extracting .
This is a very anxious video of a video that has never been solved before , and so on , I would have given you a little bit of a custom .
And we put it like this : we picked it up in the room , put it into space , and then after the monitor on each side .
All the people who walked into the room would see themselves as a monitor , with all the acceptance : one person in the room would always be the same as the one who was laughing at the room .
And this is the work that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the back of the line . &quot; &quot; He comes up like a poem , like a piece of paper , like a drawing of a maid or a flight .
Before the accomplishment came , it was very strong and concrete , the same as it was , very weaker .
So people , when they put in a room , they would put it into a room , they would think it would be just some extra .
But as soon as the news passed , he would take his shoulder to look up .
Until finally , he would never abandon that , and he would shuffle .
( Laughter ) This is an open-source cartoon .
It &apos;s so heavy , so full of tough ideas that it &apos;s kind of falling into the cafeteria , and its quest is coming out of it like a plant .
He irrigates them down to the end as if he &apos;s drunk , very slowly , slowly .
His movement is adapted to a circle .
There wouldn &apos;t be a circle there , and the floor would be very equal , and he would be hugging throughout the space .
And there are no layers or hair .
I &apos;m going to show you the following : People coming into the room , doing the active thing .
It &apos;s very slow , in a few minutes , as you can see through the pain , you can see the scaffold coming down , and it turns out that I was looking around .
And that &apos;s important because that &apos;s how we wanted to encourage the insight of an instinct to help him , save him .
I would love him to be anxious , because he might be able to do something about his own .
This was a real technical challenge for us , and it worked hard for us , as well as most of our jobs , to combine machinery , to tackle things that are great and exciting .
And it was very important for us to set up his experience precisely , because if you were to put him up so that he was overwhelmed , he would be ruined , and if he didn &apos;t surface enough — there would be no inevitable lifespan , you didn &apos;t want to help him .
I &apos;m going to show you a very short clip of the video we &apos;re drawing on this — it &apos;s a lot faster .
Chew &apos;s ass . He &apos;s going to let that go .
He &apos;s still struggling , and he &apos;s struggling to improve him .
But you don &apos;t need it because it becomes its own self .
This is a particularly inclusive job of our work , and we worked with the steps of our toast , the cumulative dreams of the optical lungs , the gulls , the guns , like a dream .
And that tells you how the sky is .
Throughout that , we &apos;ve managed to approximate the shape of a mosque that &apos;s shaped like a shape that &apos;s covered in palm .
Our desire was to threw something out of it , in terms of distance and distance and everything , as we all know , with the mystery of steel , that feels and approaches .
And the idea behind that was that after a year , you should have looked at this shape as a bear , and you should have realized it as a hole in the space , as if you were looking at it in a spectacular waves .
And this is a consequence of doing things that are still being created , that &quot; &quot; the locker of the space . &quot; &quot; You can see the undivided hump , a little bit of a crowd that &apos;s attached to them in the middle of a room that &apos;s trying to get you up , enjoy them , grow up , grow up in the middle of a cattle of a cattle , and the eight-year-old yellow to that gap .
So the dog is expanding , and it &apos;s expanding , and it &apos;s expanding , and it &apos;s keeping you connected to the people around the house — you know , trying to get your mystery out of it or whatever .
We work a lot with technology at work , and I love it because it reminds us of years from now .
There &apos;s a new one , because we &apos;re taught how it can help us express our creation qualities or our behavior .
And they &apos;re just about to reveal some creature to us , and they &apos;re discovering that the breakthrough is an attempt to discover how this creature wants to exist , what it &apos;s like to be , what it wants to be , and how it wants to be .
Wow .
( Applause )
I love him .
That &apos;s it .
Think about how much he brought us a lot .
Think of all the services that you have for the new , the connectedness , the whole industry , the whole business .
And it &apos;s happening all of our lives .
I &apos;m convinced that one day , it &apos;s going to enter the history slum a few years from now , and the time that this lady is going to be mindful of the generation that &apos;s linked to this , the generation that &apos;s created something that &apos;s very similar to this .
I think it &apos;s true that there are those who are there , that there are those who are there , that there are those who are there with them .
I &apos;ve had my whole generation come with these .
So let me show you something .
This is Brain .
This is the mouse — there &apos;s over four of them locked up by Brain.A .
It &apos;s the very first virus that &apos;s meant for the artistic team .
We know where Brain comes from .
We know because it &apos;s written in the same code .
Watch .
Okay .
This is the inventor of the visitor &apos;s behavior , the inventor of the inventor , and the one that I looked at is the one that I looked at , and it said , &quot; &quot; Sweden arrived . &quot; &quot; And it goes on forever , and it goes on , 1986 , and it &apos;s Amjad .
And then there is a name for Amjad , an emergency name .
There &apos;s a number of fathers before , and there &apos;s an addition .
( Laughter ) So , 1986 .
There &apos;s more to it .
That &apos;s 25 years back .
That &apos;s 25 years from now .
So one month ago , I didn &apos;t want to go back to the wall .
So , with some fingertips , I did it until I was there .
This is from the Lord Mountain , which is about 300 feet away from the limb , where Bin Love was built .
This is a very peculiar picture of him .
And as it turns out , there &apos;s a few or a few people along the way that I &apos;m giving 730 Nobel laugh at the coast of Iceland .
I knocked on the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess what opened the door ?
It &apos;s Amjad ; they &apos;re still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is the stop .
His brand to Amjad was drinking .
These were the guys who were the first letters of the AK virus .
And yet , of course , we &apos;ve been very interested in this .
I invited them , you know .
I came up with how they felt because of what they started .
And I would bring up this puzzle because of the recognition that so many of you in Amjad were also enforced to have dozens of times before they were completely disconnected from those years .
So the world is still right .
Their fathers that we created were able to see in the 1980s and the 1990s , of course , were no longer there .
Sorry , I &apos;m going to sell a couple of these as they came out .
I &apos;m here to put up a system that I &apos;m about to get old applications on the modern team .
So now I &apos;m going to allow you to finally create some tools that are there . It &apos;s there .
There &apos;s a list of old viruses .
So now I &apos;m going to let a few tops up on my suitcase .
For example , we started with Centigrade .
So you can see the cover of your teams streaming into your eyebrows , and it happens when you get there .
What you know is that you &apos;re locked away because the virus is visible .
This is another one . This is a real virus called Crush , which was formed in Rwanda in 1992 .
I &apos;m going to show you one that &apos;s with sound .
( Honk ) And then I would put it up to the size , guess what the virus was doing .
So when you get in , after you get in , the guy will start hitting the guy .
So it was quite slow to realize that you &apos;re stuck in the roof at the time that you &apos;ve made roofs and cans .
Silence , they don &apos;t get cheese and teens .
The surface of this is global .
What this has got to be our strength , which is a new way of doing our labs for size , with the next generation of challenges in the virtual world .
So you can see in real time that we &apos;ve just covered up the roof and in Sweden , and in Tahana and in Rwanda and so forth .
In fact , what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to get access to our laboratory through it , and we &apos;re going to be able to go out and get the floor together , some virus , some new emergency application programs that we have every day .
This is the latest virus we &apos;ve ever created , which is the phrase I &apos;m giving .
And we had three of them before — the addition to this — before the dog came .
And they &apos;re going to bring it down , it &apos;s literally a huge amount of it .
We take them for granted , even brands for granted .
And that &apos;s just going to put 20 of them on a pedestal application every day .
And where do they all come from ?
Now , this one , it &apos;s mostly organized by sanctuary tasks that make up these ropes because they make up the viruses .
It &apos;s kind of like — I went to this building Buck.com.
This is a website that leads to a leg where men are going to buy their way through the company .
So you &apos;re a virtual writer , and you &apos;re going to invite people into the magazine , but you don &apos;t know what to do with it , you can make those tasks to sell them — somebody &apos;s a contributor — these people .
And they &apos;ll even kiss you for those comments .
So how do these guys make up their cheeks ?
Well , there are a number of different ways , like bankers for &quot; &quot; trauma , &quot; &quot; which will make you angry for your banking , when it &apos;s new , it can be a quality .
The &quot; &quot; American &quot; &quot; is quietly hidden in your space and record everything you print .
So you &apos;re on your team , and you &apos;re looking for Google .
Every single Google search for you , the design of printing , is scalable and downloaded .
Each one of you is an exposure to gay and send to the mountains .
The same sticks for each of you and every one of you looks like this .
But what they &apos;re mostly looking for is siblings , where you link them and you interrupt any marketplace in the market .
Because when you buy in the grocery stores , you need to record your name , the deadline of retrieval , the disparate number of telescopes , and the dignified details of the telescope .
And the phrase of this will be the size of this , creating a few weeks ago , we had a server .
This is the number of dispensers , the roller coaster burns , surrounded by the name and the name of the individual .
When you get access to someone who has these big data points , you can connect with them , and you can buy whatever you want .
And that , in the eyes of the eye , is it .
We now have an isolated set of markets and entrepreneurial ecosystem that is created by creating the inherent aspects of our insults .
The shepherds of how they &apos;re really going to make their surgeries out of their surgeries , and they look at INTERPOL pages and find out the most compelling aspects .
We investigate people like Bhn who come from Switzerland , and his dedication of the Sweden , who also exposed to the INTROL blog on the edges of INTERPOL , on the list of blogs , on the hills or on the Uphilia , on the elevator .
These guys were doing surgery showing I.M. , the surgery of the cyberbullying surgery that they had contained billions .
They seem to be staying still .
They didn &apos;t know where they were .
Just a few weeks ago , J.A. officials poured out a Switzerland bank account waiting for a second , and in that bank , there were about .9 billion dollars .
So what they do is they generate enormous amount of vulnerability .
And it turns out that the perpetrators of the perpetrator can allow you to put into the future .
What we know is that these volunteers hold up their curriculum , extend their hair , and they have tattoos with the SQL supply chain .
And they can let us see how we work — how people work — and trying to get off from any other medium , creating a fraud .
They also benefit the global warming of their own benefits .
In fact , those are the usual suspects .
This is the assumption that we call it .
And you step back and you look at what &apos;s happening now in the rest of the world , and you look at the video that &apos;s being done in an iPhysical way , and it &apos;s based on the idea of making sure that the entire curriculum can move around the world .
This surgery , which I think , comes from it , moves from one country to the other when you try to make a page .
So these guys are just unable to get a few .
They &apos;ve moved from one country to another , from one island to the other — moves around the world , new assumptions that we have unlocked the capacity globally to support law when they do so .
So they &apos;re like , you know , some kind of hand-carved airplanes for all the world for free .
So those of you who have supported us so far are now capable .
So , are we celebrating this for the purpose of these people ?
How can you get the textile from that ?
Let me show you the one .
What we have here is one of the flags that we have .
Chew , I &apos;m looking at a chronic image of a puzzle that &apos;s puzzled .
And it turns out , from a point of view , that what you &apos;re trying to do is look at the snowflake of the snowflake on your owl &apos;s membership , the phylum is going to take you through your peer control and letter .
So you look at the photo of this , and it &apos;s a piece of cloth — it &apos;s a little bit of an anthropologist , and it &apos;s a real start of the attack .
And those were the ones that were prepared for him , that he was preparing for him .
He was prepared for the XOR .
You just need me to thank you , he was so busy .
And we can get there , and we can actually challenge it .
Well , the majority of the code is already out there .
And I know it doesn &apos;t really show you any other organ .
But look at it directly .
And those of you who are really going to see that at the bottom , you might be able to look at the name of the addition : send seventh / io.exe , and when you look at the slices on your device , it &apos;s actually going to send it back and forth .
And it &apos;s a blank enforcement , and through the course , it will take your place .
But what &apos;s even more interesting is that for us , as far as we &apos;ve been preparing for this , we &apos;re going to have a shift in the way that O60,000 KO78RUS has written .
And those are the ones that are there , after all of this procrastinating , sort of like some signature .
He has no excuse for anyone .
And I was looking at him , and I was trying to figure out what he was doing .
So I &apos;m catching up with him .
They had their yoga records , they didn &apos;t .
So I brought up with the guys in the lab .
We had several rooms in the magazine , and one of them said that might be like Rouis .
And 78 is a forest in the town of Porge .
For example , you can find it in the number of numbers and in the number of illuminators , and in similar parts .
So I started looking for these things in Prince , and through those classes , we finally put them in a particular page .
This is a message that has been affected by this for a few years , which has got its own aspect page , and it leads its agenda to a pop platform in Live Journal .
And in this interview , he wrote about his life , as he lived in Porge — he wrote about his trauma at the beginning of the event — about his cat , his girlfriend .
And he has a very beautiful car .
Before that , it &apos;s a man who has traveled to the edge of a sanctuary of September 12 with a poem of pearl and over 400 horses .
Well , it &apos;s a pretty good car for 20 or 20 years to come out of the spring .
How do I know about the car before ?
Because he wrote about it .
In fact , it &apos;s his own crash .
He was bringing him to the next car .
And he put a note on that incision of his own statement — you know , his expectation — this is the Lady League that he put into .
And you might think that it &apos;s 78RUS .
And then you look at all the crash , and you can see that the number on the table is O68 KO78RUS .
Well , I &apos;m not a lawyer , but I would have told you , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a baggage . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what do you mean when the incentives are overwhelmed ?
Well , the song is so far away .
The Great League of many of these lines of rejection , we don &apos;t even know from the deaf attack .
And even though that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with these recordings , there &apos;s no song at all .
They have more political than that , and they do that , and there &apos;s not enough evidence , arguing about some other assumptions that we have to fight them .
I would like everyone to help but thanks , that &apos;s not the case .
But everything changes quickly .
You &apos;ve all heard of people like that xnet .
And as they looked at what they did , they signed up .
This is Siemens S7,400 PLC programmed to have a government puzzle .
And that &apos;s what drives our infrastructure .
This is what drives us all around .
PLC , those little boxes , the maggots , the courses , the curriculum , they &apos;re programmed , put it into their place and create a work .
For example , the elevators in this room are very , very powerful songs for those songs .
And when there &apos;s one out there , there &apos;s a huge amount of reference that we need to worry about .
Because everything around us is driven by this .
I mean , we have that infrastructure .
They &apos;re going to go into any factory , but they &apos;re going to cost anything , any chemistry factory , the manufacturing factory , look at — everything is driven by a component .
Everything is controlled by comments .
Everything is waiting for this team to drink .
We &apos;re very expected to all of you , from suspicion like electricity , of course , from a wedding team .
And those are things that make us all new .
We privileged ourselves to have a way of engaging in something that doesn &apos;t even exist .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what happens is that we can do things even when we have our own thoughts .
It &apos;s actually a very simple idea — the thinking of continuity , the thinking of attributes , the things that are really important .
I &apos;ve told you — ( Laughter ) I love it . I love it .
Think about all the consequences we get .
Think about who they would be from you , every day you wouldn &apos;t mess them , for one or another .
I see a beauty in the future , but I &apos;m suggesting that we can &apos;t see it .
I &apos;m not worried that we &apos;re encountering them for deception .
And their insistence is one of the people who can take these things from us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been expecting my life to be this network , and I believe that what we have learned from this is that we have the courage to inspire us to celebrate everything we have lost .
We need to do it globally , and we need to do it now .
What we need is , I &apos;m afraid of somebody who &apos;s complaining about their rights , who &apos;s looking for their own pursuit of refusing to get them — these organisms that are creating billions of their attacks .
It &apos;s a lot more important than not having a solid program and a wireless supply .
What &apos;s really important is that this creation of the postcaste people , and more importantly , we have to find those people who are preparing to become the parts of the world for injuries , but not anymore .
We need to discover people with us , but without limitations , and to give that power to the news , we need to innovate within our well-being .
That &apos;s very good for you .
( Applause )
So it was in &apos; 95 , I was laughing at the edge of the incision , with a friend of mine from this road , Rod Aille , to this dark October government .
You know , we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere where where , and we &apos;re in a few countries over the parks and the lines of the parks , the longest few of us who have only been able to do .
And somewhere in the middle of the Doctor , I came back to my friend , and I wrote a memo that would roll me in the arms of the ark .
&quot; What is the lamp of the Chinese man coming out of the line ? &quot;
My friend , he looked at me absolutely surely .
In fact , the element of the first is the ideal for her to marry her .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; People , all these clouds , we see a Chinese elevator on the curriculum . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re just going to go into me for a few moments and then let me laugh , because you know what I &apos;m talking about .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
( Laughter ) Indeed , the killing of the Chinese elevator is nowhere . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent five years of my life being able to do things like this — that sometimes we don &apos;t really understand the things that are going to happen to us , and how we act when we do that , and what all of this can do about the human implications .
In other words , as you &apos;ve heard from Chris , I &apos;ve used five years to be able to make mistakes .
It can come as if there &apos;s one great privilege of the king , I would say , of course , that has one great privilege : to laugh at it .
( Laughter ) In fact , many of us do everything we can to avoid the possibility of the mistake , or the avoiding power of the event , of the possibility of being able to do ourselves .
We understand it in the eyes .
We know everyone in this room has a problem .
People &apos;s challenges , bendaries , they &apos;re wrong .
But whenever it hasn &apos;t descended to me right now , all of my affairs will be present here tonight , muttering the blindness , building all of these blindness clouds , humbling the light from the clouds — and finally , finally , blurring for what I &apos;m asking .
The reality is that the present age is where we live .
We lay down in the markets ; we sneak our lasers to come up with the dog ; we go into the market and we vote for the staff .
In the real world , we &apos;re all kind of hooked up a couple of years into our lives , stuck in this little sense that we &apos;re very , very right for everything , bubble .
I think that &apos;s what it is .
I think that &apos;s something that for each of us , like some of our aspects and our professional lives , and I think that &apos;s something that we all share as a warrior .
So what I want to do next is , first of all , talk about how we build our sense of justice .
And second , that &apos;s what it is .
And finally , I want to encourage you that there is a possibility of coming out of that feeling , and that you could do that , it would be the only great thing to do , the only intellectual and the crossword puzzle to do .
So what do we build on this right ?
All of those assumptions , in fact , have to do with feeling when we &apos;re in bed .
So let me leave you with this — close , let me invite you here , because you &apos;re right here : What &apos;s the feeling of — the empathy — how does the cloud feel ?
Barmor . No silence .
Fine . OK , good , good .
In my urine , deficient creature , magnetic — to you , it &apos;s a very reply , I would say it to you in a different way .
The people , the people , you say to me , what is it like to realize they &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) And the idea that you &apos;re asking can be like that and other people , right ?
I mean , it can be a whirlwind person , it can be a whirlwind person , it can be funny , like my dreams mistake for Chinese memory .
But just being out of the house , it &apos;s not being wasted .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you .
Do you remember the animation of Loony Tony , where there was a long-term cartoon , there was always a tendency , there was no sensation to the anger of the dance ?
Each of the films in each of the videos had a series of things that would be there that would be there , that would be there , that would be there , that would be good , that would be there and that would be there .
But the thing is that the threat will come from the light .
And what &apos;s funny is , you know , if you &apos;re a little bit of an animal for this year — that &apos;s all very good for that too .
He &apos;s just going to keep shouting — to the exact same amount of acceptance , and he realizes he &apos;s in air .
That &apos;s when he &apos;s there .
They think of something as wrong — not when we perceive it , but before that — we are like the one after the one comes out of the mouth , and before it comes down , when it comes down to humiliation .
You know , we &apos;re already in bed , but we &apos;re feeling like we &apos;re on the other side .
So , to be honest , I should be honest because I told you a moment before .
We feel like we &apos;re asking , we feel like we &apos;re right .
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s a whole range of assumptions that we &apos;ve made in this sense that we &apos;re right .
I call this wrong blind .
For most of our classes , we don &apos;t have to worry about the inner circle , which is to tell us that there &apos;s something wrong with something until we &apos;re too late .
But there &apos;s an early addition that we have to put on this addition — and it &apos;s an argument .
Please take a moment to start with education .
From there , from there , and your learning is bringing back the mysteries , and one of them shows you this .
By the way , it &apos;s not thinkable .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the primary school , and you know exactly what you could think of the one that &apos;s on the page .
A dreamer of hers , a tender of order , one that doesn &apos;t always help homework .
So before you get older , you &apos;ve already learned that , first of all , those people who come to the task are wrong , those who don &apos;t say the bottles — and , you know , if you want to have a life of excuse , you don &apos;t have to close up the clouds .
We teach these real lessons about laughter very fine .
And many of us — and I guess , especially many of us in this room — are literally becoming ideal for the small , immersive , rebellion , remembered .
I mean , the funding I get , what about the ultra-marathons ?
( Laughter ) I mean , you &apos;re all a funding engineer , you know , the ultra-marathon particles .
OK , that &apos;s great .
And the clarity is that in the tube , we &apos;re going to be able to do something wrong .
Because , in fact , there &apos;s something wrong with us , that there &apos;s something wrong with us .
So we &apos;re literally holding out for granted that we are right because we feel smart , responsible , and there &apos;s good .
So let me tell you a story .
About a year later , a woman came to this place , Desonia , with her center surgery .
They &apos;re there .
This is the default hospital , the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in , and she &apos;s interested in the operating room .
She &apos;s unsettled , who &apos;s going to help her work — linked and sent her to an operating room .
They think everything &apos;s fine .
Her husband , a promise to put yourself in and say , &quot; &quot; What is the nature of my son not the side of my son ? &quot; &quot; So not her height is half of the titles , because the surgery has reached the surgery of her surgery as if she was in the middle of the line .
And even though these were the healing preferences of the quality of the prison , he talked about the dog , he said something interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , some assumptions of this addition were that he was the correct side . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The essence of this story is that through a greater sense of belief , that in the right direction of everything could be very , very strong .
And the idea of judgment , the way we all experience it , is that the song is not a satisfaction for what &apos;s actually happening in the outside world .
And whenever we marry based on that , and we set off to the possibility that we &apos;re going to ask , at this point , we ultimately lost all the other things , like 757 million liters of petrol fuels going to the Mexican visit , argue that there is a collapse of generations .
So this is a huge amount of value .
But occasionally , it &apos;s also a huge social act .
Think about a moment about what &apos;s possible for us to feel .
It &apos;s rarely true that you think your contribution is just going to reveal the truth .
And when you feel that way , you have to decide how you &apos;re going to fix your reality to all the people that are not going to fit with you ?
And it turns out that a lot of us in the real world are searching in a similar way — destroying some misconceptions .
The past , the curriculum is what we do when someone doesn &apos;t speak to us , we just think they &apos;re unintelligent .
They don &apos;t have access to that same information like us , and we humiliate that with them , they will go out and they will come for our team .
When it doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that those people have killed the same exact same as us , and they &apos;re still not with us , we &apos;re transferring to the second assumptions that are — they are .
( Laughter ) They have all the right parts of the box , I would love you too much to make them right .
And when we think about it , and it doesn &apos;t work , and when it turns out that those people who didn &apos;t take us away from it were the same that they were smart , we get to the third assumptions : they &apos;ve promised the mystery , and they &apos;ve studied it after the menstrual Global Goals .
So that &apos;s it .
This distinction to our right three makes us avoid classrooms , which makes us all interested in doing it , and make us feel terrible for others .
But what excites me about this , and what really excites me about this , is that this is something that we love about being human .
It &apos;s like we want to visualize that our minds are transparent , and we &apos;re literally looking at the world that is responsible for this .
And you want everybody to look at the same thing and see the same thing .
It &apos;s not limited , and to do so , life would be unbelievable .
Your lack of suffering is not enough to see the world as it is .
The magic is that you see the world as it is not .
You could have gone in the past , and you could have talked about the past , and you could have imagined what was possible in the next place .
And we &apos;re all doing it a little bit differently , because we can look at the same sky and see that as well .
And yes , we &apos;re asking for that too .
From the age of 00 to Dectart , he said , &quot; &quot; I wonder , dominated , I &apos;m , &quot; &quot; St. Gore came back , and he wrote , &quot; &quot; Fallor &apos;s Report , &quot; &quot; Cloudburst , I &apos;m .
Eventually , it seems to me that our ability to commemorate is not some kind of embarrassment of a human being , something that we might eliminate close to .
That &apos;s the whole base of what you are .
Because unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on there .
And differently from all other species , we &apos;re trying to fix this .
And we think that &apos;s the story that we all think of as being so intense and so forth .
Last year , because of some assumptions , I put myself in an expectation for many , many more radio shows , &quot; This is the life of an idiocy . &quot;
And I asked you , and I asked you , and I started to feel like I had all these stories about clubs .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I was hungry .
I became a crazy cloud .
I just visualized them everywhere , which happened not once .
But a couple of months later , I actually had to put it to Ira Gates .
And I remembered him about it , and he said something like this , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sure that &apos;s true .
And then , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; as a lady , we laugh that everyone in this room has that same hidden topic .
And that hidden puzzle is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get all the things out there , and everything is there . &quot; &quot; And the need for it is , &quot; &quot; the Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need it .
We need all of these concepts , mistakes and classrooms , to tell these stories about the credible credit . &quot; &quot; And the rest of us , the slogans , the rulers , the weekends , the losses .
We feel like the statistical scenarios of the scenario , the falling bullshit , and the absence of the hidden .
In our stories , we get asked .
But , you know , our stories are like that because our lives are like that .
We think it &apos;s going to happen to everyone , and there &apos;s nothing for that to happen .
And his name , Bush , believed that he would build Idaha , found a lot of mass incarceration weapons , that would include people , and that would include in the violence in the Rome .
And some of them went out there .
Host Mubarak believed that he would be the great honor of Egypt in his life before he was too old and too sick and he would be able to transfer his government to his son .
And some of them went out there .
And you may have thought that you &apos;re going to grow up and buy out of high school loving , engage your city and raise your own city .
And some of them went out there .
And I have to tell you that I have to tell you that I have written the unbelievable exit of a slum about everything that everybody has done , that the cops never came back .
And some of them went out there .
( Laughter ) I mean , that &apos;s life .
Far and frail , we are creating unbelievable stories about the world that surround us , and the world that surrounds us and hurts us .
Unsuspicious , but what it &apos;s all about is an unbelievable lesson for us to go wrong .
We &apos;re literally talking to people on the island last week about the knowledge and the advantage and the adoption , but you know , what does it mean for all of these things and these vulnerabilities and adults ?
They say half of the people who were the most likely to rememberate and change the world — TED .
( Laughter ) Right ? ( Laughter )
Where did my lunch lunch , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So we &apos;re there .
And that &apos;s how it happens .
We empower the next movement .
We tell another story .
We &apos;re doing another one .
Strangely , as you &apos;ve heard it over billions of times , it &apos;s the discovery of both .
And for me , those of the real people who want to come out of this , I need to step outside of this tiny , horrible fluctuation of the space of justice and look out all the others and look out at the broader and look at the mystery and see , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Oh .
( Applause ) Like you guys . ( Applause )
This is the 50th anniversary of the article , the name of Sydam Nosair , put it into an inner city in Management , and drove out Rabbi Media and the Jewish gency League .
And those plans were crushed by the FTB counter .
Unfortunately , in 1993 , the destruction of the World War II was not there .
Nosair was finally there for his sharing .
This is my strength in Southern Nosair .
Before I tell myself that when people are communicating with each other , you realize that from life , you don &apos;t need to be compassionate .
A few months after his army , he pulled me in , and pointed out that the last few weeks with friends in a gorgeous shock to the Alic shock .
He said I would have to go with him the next morning .
That day , I was announced by my tears , and I was placing myself in a little orange pocket that was over the dense and everything , and especially my suggestion , all of your brilliance .
And then we got to the next guy , and the arms came back , and the arms said , &quot; &quot; Be Babbath . &quot; &quot; What the hell and the sons .
For them , all this command came out very funny , but just a few years later , I realized what was so funny to them .
They thought that I had seen the same wish to nurse , the fuel had my strength .
These people were finally up to the coastal gray of 650 elements of art and supporting the equation of the invasion , the Global Circle , the Global Circle of Eastern Great to the North Pole , which has shattered the Global Goal Goals , with the Ivory Coast for over 1,000 .
These were the people I created loud .
People that I would call them amateurs , which would rarely be .
The bottlenecks of the time I was in my new vegetable , the songs were coming out .
I was terrified of the supply of people with unprecedented sodas , like race or theirs .
So , who opened my eyes ?
All of the first passions that made my mind were in the presidential election of the 2000s .
Through our grasslands , we were sent to the violence by the unit , because I was given the most part of my life , and this was a particularly feeling for me .
Our teams have come from all of our lives .
On the whole day , I found out that when I was running a conference , I knew that one of the guys that I &apos;d been friends with was Jewish .
I didn &apos;t have a fight for this , and , honestly , I felt an admiration that I could go to a barrier that most of my life was seen as incapable .
The main characteristic of the revelation was when I met my teenage job in the Bush in the park .
It was my expectations for all hopes and all those people for me , and it was my deepest appreciation for the performance .
The majority of my life has been told to me that homosexuality has been declined , and that all homosexuals have done an undeniable ability .
In my park , I got the capacity to work with some homosexual artists and routinely understand that they were better , the smallest supportive people I &apos;ve ever met .
The experience of kindness with people in my mind has caused the sense of openness to others , and I &apos;ve found that there &apos;s something wrong with the well-being of people , not the way I &apos;d like to beat me .
And as a result of that , I was able to support all of my trained staff with a life of excellence and acceptance .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be a homosexual , but I &apos;m confused with the right to do something else for it .
They were called &quot; &quot; The Great Leap . &quot; &quot; And as Jon Steve took me to be honest with him about my attitude , and helped me realize that the person race , whether or not they were hungry , was not inclusive .
He was a constant threat to me when I needed it deeply .
Throughout this acquisition , it can discover in places that are indistinguishable , and the realization that the Jewish man who has made me a greater test for me than the strength of my life , I &apos;m not sure .
Last day , she was talking to me about my worldwide change , and she was telling me what I was going to be next to before I was a cure .
And she looked at me at a guinea activist who had come close enough to see me and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to get people to come . &quot;
That year , I knew a little bit of the carbon needed to hold unlocked in myself .
Zack Ebrahim is not my real name .
I would offer him a moment when we had no idea how to connect with this , and to start a new life .
So what have I been telling my story , and I could have taken myself into myself ?
It &apos;s a confusion .
I &apos;ve done it with hope that something has forced a new violence that will ever hear my story and understand that there &apos;s a better way , and I &apos;ve been feeling that I &apos;m going to come to this north , a nonprofit ideal , I haven &apos;t been fooled by the discovery of the future .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing , I &apos;m putting my own passionate background in front of the terrain before I get there .
I &apos;m doing it because of trauma and their loved ones , due to battlefield and loss of food that they had in their lives .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about these feelings of experience and adopting my own health .
And as a result of that , I &apos;ve been trying to figure out how to make sure that violence is not something that &apos;s out of existence or race , and that the sons can &apos;t catch their feet .
I &apos;m not my fault .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Oh , all of you . ( Applause ) All of you . ( Applause ) Wow . ( Applause )
A few years ago , I took my own home .
And when I try to get access to that , and when I look in others , I realize I &apos;m not going to hurt .
To be honest , I could see it over the course of a government &apos;s room where it &apos;s black and palm .
So I rushed quickly , and I tested the other door and the hell , and they were all well infected .
And I wanted to go back to my friend , and I wanted to go back to my friend , because I had an anticipated flight in the morning , and I needed my passport and I thought .
From my eyes and from my frozen , I fell into a dial stone , and I scattered out the orchestra stone , and I scattered out the stone of these , and I setled out , and I found out that I could find an alarm cow , and I could lay out a hole in the morning , that the morning , the enough clarity , that I could call a bear , that
It &apos;s going to be expensive , but you have nothing to do with spontaneous restraints about the middle of nothingness , and I thought , according to the appearance , the ears are similar .
I &apos;m a neuroscientist by Professor , and I know a little bit about how the judge works for the passion .
They separate the vessel , which adjusts the floating , they change the equation and destroy the mind .
( Laughter ) And only a few passengers , I realized that I was not going to get lost . ( Laughter )
This is me landing through my nose and everything , 40 messages , I took my hip , I went back to the hill , I was still warming , but they were giving my place to someone else , and I was threatened to the hip at the back of the plane , into the wall of the wall , into the chair that doesn &apos;t disappear , at the heart of an hour .
Well , I had a laser to help during that hour of return .
( Laughter ) And I started thinking , can you do something , make it compelling , make it compelling , make it compelling from those who are there ?
Or , if somebody were to blame for something , I would consider the fact that it would be a sum .
So I started thinking about it , but the mind didn &apos;t stop thinking about it until it got about a month .
I would come with my own , my own judgment , my own judgment , and I would talk to you a little bit about my exhaustion and how I forgot the message , and I would tell you that he would be doing something I would do when I would come out of the closet .
( Laughter ) This is what Gary Kleen is doing , his essay , a few years ago , called an additional accident .
You know , there &apos;s nothing wrong with this .
When there &apos;s no shortage , those teams come and try to fix what happens .
Their preferences are to be aware of some of the few , some of the things that can be present as addictive to silence .
Some eyes are isolated , no .
I &apos;m going to throw myself off the back .
They &apos;ll put a place of songs in them that will lay out .
Sounds like a health mind , and it is , but it confirms a lot of learning , and it &apos;s a kind of cognitive memory .
There &apos;s some called the hypothesis , which has been going on over the years to be able to follow important parts of the world — where there &apos;s a poem where you can find the fish , the windshield , the windpipe where you can find the ferocious and the assumptions .
And the assumption is that part of the wall that puts out in London as a driver .
This is the part that makes it easier for us to find our limits .
And if you think about it , somebody from the test did an experiment where the wind was coming down to it , and they would still find the riots .
They &apos;re not around the corner , but the hippocampus , that &apos;s a great idea for making a wall mechanism for making songs .
But he does only work well with people who don &apos;t move too much , and not so much to move part .
And that &apos;s what we think of as the consequences of the weekend or the weekend .
Their home would put a place in your own house — going to the door , maybe going to the door .
For the world , there are certain states .
The Chinese is a control table .
You &apos;re going to place it in a place and push it back , your songs will always be there when you need them .
What about a few rows ?
Their assumptions are going to be fueled by this telescope , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by your imagination , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way
Her songs will say or her laughter , you &apos;ll have a lot of fun getting it .
And they &apos;re quite blind .
Remember , when you drill into the strength , the wall goes like this .
And the zoo is constant , and it confuses thinking .
Their particles of perceived insurance from the insurance of others realize that within a passion , we are not the only ones that can be there , and that &apos;s what it does for the resources system .
And you don &apos;t have to worry about the situation where you &apos;re going to need to adopt your health .
And someday , we will all be in a situation where we have to make very important goals about our own or our own treatment or our service to help us make news .
They want to bring it up .
I &apos;m going to talk about the context of the situation .
But this is something that all of the memes have to do with treatment , and even for funding or for societal access to the mothers — but for any individual , to make sure that there &apos;s an affair that &apos;s going to be there .
And then you come from there , and she says , &quot; What I have just received from you and your cholera is quite shaky . &quot;
You know , if you &apos;re waiting for a cholera to come out with a grade of his illness , his suffering , you .
And you might think that you &apos;re waiting for a cholera equation is not good , and you say , &quot; &quot; Hey , let me give you a dreamer that &apos;s going to help you get the cholera era era into , build it . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve heard about the statues , they &apos;re all about the most profound tropes in the world today , maybe you know something that &apos;s even though it &apos;s tied .
This is the scaffold needed to be cured .
And what &apos;s the heart of SRP ?
It &apos;s the shocks of people who have a user &apos;s dream or a surgery or a other treatment to get one to die .
You might have , what &apos;s in the hell here ?
This one would have to be alone .
But it doesn &apos;t really work that way .
And it &apos;s not a fault of a guilt , if anything for that is true , it would be scientists like me .
We have not compromised all the passionate mechanisms .
But Glxov Kline calls that 90 percent of the widgets are between 30 and 50 percent .
So the challenge is to get the message to the building , what would it be ?
How many people need it to be consumed to be alone ?
300 .
I looked at the scares myself .
300 people have a dream for consumer years , while they &apos;re involved in a few of them , whether or not they &apos;re others .
You might have said , &quot; &quot; All of the 300 anniversary of the cholera .
Who &apos;s not ? Give me those dreams . &quot; &quot; But then you have to wait for the gratitude , and this is , &quot; &quot; What are the headlines for you ? &quot; &quot; Right ?
And there are all kinds of things : following the muscle and the weaving of circles , the scope and the magazine — but you can now say , &quot; &quot; Five , it &apos;s not very convinced that it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;m still going to take the dream . &quot; &quot; But wait .
You remember , you &apos;re going to be careful to think .
300 people in favor of a dream , and it turns out , five percent of those 300 people in revenue are 15 people .
Fifteen times I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to be dressed than you &apos;re going to help .
I &apos;m not telling you whether a user &apos;s building or not .
And I &apos;m saying that you &apos;ve had a conversation with your neighbor .
You have the right to get the information to be able to tell if you want to be able to do the whole thing or not .
And you might be able to say that I &apos;ve taken the dog out of the room to frighten you , but it &apos;s a pretty typical destruction to cheat .
Mostly surgeries will happen over 50 years , building blocks due to wind , dealing with the need to be 50 .
In other words , there &apos;s 49 surgeries while one person is interested .
And the refrigerators are up to 50 percent .
They &apos;re empathy , they &apos;re erections , they &apos;re ignorance , they &apos;re reaching out latrines , they &apos;re seen .
And if you succeed , and you are one of those who gets it , you might be three years or two .
The predisposition of the investigation is before the intervention of the past , the remembering that they should make , that they should move forward .
Really find it to be able to build a building .
And you had to remember the quality of life .
Because you have a song , or do you want a short life without a hurt , or a long one that can carry a lot of hurricane ?
That &apos;s what you should say about deaf courses right now with your pocket and your loved ones .
You can replace yourself in the hot run , but you will be halfway into the mastery .
From the eye of the rubber , I don &apos;t have to worry about the root anymore , or the rest of us , or the rest of us , because if some of these particles were going to be striking for our isolation and not running quickly , you could get rid of the liver , and then that &apos;s not good .
Unfortunately , one of those people who try to escape through that is rare , that has no idea how someone has selected it .
So we have to train ourselves from early on to think about those situations .
I think it &apos;s important that we need to admit that we &apos;re not alone .
We will always fail .
The idea is that when we get past that , what &apos;s not going to happen is that because we &apos;ve had the same way that we can make a damage , that we can make a damage , that we can make some of those things .
And when I came back to that moon in Monrealm , when I came back after my ride , I felt that I was going to be able to build a warrior outside of my door , with all of you from the front door , with my background remembering .
You have to know that I still have a prophet that I didn &apos;t suck , that I didn &apos;t suck it , that I didn &apos;t buy it .
So I &apos;m not entirely tired of it , but I can see it sort of like a laser for it , and I &apos;m moving forward .
They &apos;re just like that .
( Applause )
About 50 years ago , in the Netherlands Indeed , they were blurring to the department of this unholy place .
They were hoping to paint a lot of people around the world for the first time in history of closing the space .
The rocks were huge .
With the same amount of impact on the front , I have on the inside — two radios .
In 1957 , they were spending four . They were going to be there .
All the science behind this year wrote , &quot; We &apos;re going to build a new piece that &apos;s called Swing . &quot;
In those days , a few weeks ago , like Vasco da Game and us , had the plea to discover new materials .
Moreover , we need to discover the space .
And that &apos;s going to lead others to be our joy in the future . &quot; &quot; And you look at the mentor of &quot; &quot; Swing , &quot; &quot; my fifth anniversary of the movie , which is kind of suspended .
He tells the story of Show and how he got it .
They had all the pleasure of the Palm Show .
The fabric of that being made , seen by the loss of the limbs , had been hired by the respect and declaration that people had finally pulled out of the space .
I &apos;d seen three days later , called &quot; &quot; the red Monday , &quot; &quot; a lexicon of the book and where we were left with it , and we believed that Street was the conclusion that our pride influenced us in teaching and in the field of circumstances , and that now they can contemplate the water bombs by kidding the Sweden .
That &apos;s when they got there .
The Great Show has become one of the three biggest components of all skill , historical associations with Perl Harris , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
He insisted the tattoo .
He &apos;s got a call .
And that &apos;s the advantage of the space .
And as a result of that , funding over the years has grown very strongly , from 1,200 to 20,000 weapons in line .
I think the impact of Sweden was more than the production of weapons .
For example , some of you here will have to take that marriage of 1950s , that alleged hunger for surveillance , that when there are five billion people in 700 in the cities that are offering you that .
Or maybe Galllup &apos;s survey , which revealed that seven out of 10 will believe that the war will happen , and that the least 50 will look for us .
Sir &apos;ts kept on blowing and going backwards .
For example , a few of you here are strong learning only for Sweden .
Engineering , of course , for science , and in the field of location , the gap has grown significantly .
However , there was no idea that St. &apos; &quot; &quot; was also straight down to this , even to this — the profound design agency , the inclusion of what was going on , and of course — ( In the Middle East in terms of inspiration .
Our movie reveals that , as a result , that society can be uncompromised by those who have promised , as a result of a media .
But it also demonstrates that we could achieve a very unpalpable situation in which the circumstances had actually gotten very bad .
And the word &quot; &quot; Sound &quot; &quot; will be quick .
And to be honest , I would like to inspire you and help each and every one of my favorites — to be here at TED , Jay for the first time .
And I would also like to thank you all .
( Applause )
Oh , Chris .
They work for years at the Institute of Eyes , and I was at the very first TED election .
And the clarity of this is the slightest blind .
Is everything ?
This is the daily song : the time of the day , the hell , the Chinese .
We all know very well about these things every day .
The worst news was said that they would change war officials .
These were the songs that were invented in the mass in my own gift in my own country , and even when we were talking about it , the farmers would rediscover mass waves , 20 years after the war happened .
And it turns out that this is the greatest savings ever invented .
Their values were inherent in the face of the inner concepts , the difficulty of Bosnia at the beginning of the nine-year-old , the year , about 30,000 survivors , many of them died and then died , and then 100,000 were killed through war surgeries .
Their emergency room for compassion has caused a few calls for the deception of human beings and others .
It &apos;s not just about people &apos;s knowledge .
You and their savings , their testimony of behavior , and , ultimately , the mayor that they &apos;ve ever existed , the mess .
Their way of contemplating not just with the light : it has to do with people &apos;s identities .
There &apos;s always a tendency — there &apos;s no suggestion .
We will always face the death threats that are more consistent than their husbands or our race to challenge .
Our goal is that none of the hell would ever be stranger .
And as they get there , when they get there , the songs that the eggs have been carrying around with their own seat , they &apos;re very clever , they &apos;re driven , they &apos;re driven , they &apos;re put into the list and they &apos;re on it .
Thousands of restaurants are tattooed into white white puppets , equally the same as you see CSI .
The experts in these songs serve as a tool to recognize , and I would consider them new as the valuable implications of this year to look at war collections .
For the past few generations , there is a chance to find out who the songs are in their ears , looking at them , seeing them , seeing them unthinkable , ineffective and pain .
It &apos;s easy to comfort , but many of them are hardened or literally removed from our hearts and minds .
A few years ago , I had no idea how to fill every single dawn that I had , trying to create a visual archive , an archive that would review the survivors .
As a storyteller of these stories , I would like to bring back to this mundane .
I &apos;d like to inform people a little bit more than that .
And in this way , somebody will recognize the songs of these , or whether they will come from them as a permanent , disparate and hopefully inspire what has happened .
These stories are about our interactions , and the recognition of these songs is that we &apos;ve learned a little bit more about each other .
I &apos;m only a tool in this entrance that can say &quot; &quot; the subject , &quot; &quot; and that is the one that is close to us , that can be close to us .
The whole day , when all the assumptions will be recognized , there will only be a dot of them , and there will be sandwiches and day-to-day songs .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to give you some help .
And while I was challenging these days , I learned a few .
It was part of the challenge that I would try — every month , I would try to capture every day .
I would never have to be so extreme .
His base .
In fact , they don &apos;t have much fun with it .
( Applause )
Sweet . I &apos;d like to do some research .
So what we &apos;re still trying to do with these projects is to try to figure out , we &apos;re multitasking our intuitions and our secrets in the workplace .
So I &apos;m going to anticipate when we &apos;re designing these types of courses for each of these jobs .
The real project is called the Palm Glass .
People seem to be inclusive enough to put into a room and instantly enough of these flags that are not sustainable on the wall .
And then some of these things , sort of like a flash , and you can see that they &apos;re stuck in there , and it turns out , they punish and they stop in the midst of degrading .
( Laughter ) So there &apos;s some essence here .
All of them are very chaotic . They &apos;re very tired .
And we were inspired to see how much change we needed from one state to another .
And this has led us to think of a vastly different tradition of painting .
Everyone is in the 19th century , an altruist , and it &apos;s about 100 years old , and the Middle East is about to speak up .
I &apos;m just going to show you the video .
And then I would encourage you to grow a scale — big hair is about two and a half hours old .
There are so many of them . And the scale of this is A4 .
That &apos;s where the viewer enters their space , and they &apos;re staying in the line .
And after the curriculum , if the viewer was in and out of the background , the hair was kind of like coming out of the storm of the space of the storm , and the waves were coming out of the room , and the volunteers , as if they were tattooed , as if they were in a room , and they were standing in their atoms , and they were standing in their attributes .
( Laughter ) So it turns out that strength sort of creates a tendency within the lunch , you might be honest that the sheep of the hair is so firmly held by the introduction of your strength that they seem to be , that they seem to be , in fact , the art of the painting .
This brings me to a studio , an industrialized project called Rankins .
The person who comes up with a piece of paper from a remote area , I would admit to you that it &apos;s a blank A4 format , the ark of the poker &apos;s poem , which is holding out all the time from the little hands of these little hands , the creation of the poker &apos;s poker &apos;s poem , and the gap from a little piece of glass media .
And the people also think that this sculpture is like moving a really ugly little bit , like having this piece of hand washing a piece of paper without putting it on top of it , and it doesn &apos;t really matter .
So the power of this motion would move very , very much to the point where you would filter your hands .
So I &apos;m going to show you two clips of this .
Everything is too laughing , and the other one is through the arm .
And you &apos;ll see , immediately , how do you see how their image is going to lead to a passion and a subtle attitude .
So we just removed it , and we moved on to the lunch .
This is a video clip .
You &apos;re going to be able to visualize the next arm , which is not there yet .
But for us , we kind of try to kill humps as if there &apos;s a little poem behind that big poem , there &apos;s a little man with a broken hand .
It sort of expands him with his expectations of everything I need to reveal to this field , and it &apos;s very depressing to bring the poem to the drawer &apos;s desk that &apos;s being touched .
What the hell is .
It &apos;s the repetitive of what it means to be like me .
He has a skull , he has a hand , he has a hand , and he has a very deep sense of self , and his only purpose is to draw himself .
So when the viewer walks out of the hill , he sort of knocks out of one direction , and he moves his hand , and I laughed , and I laughed at the lunchtime music .
This is the first stage of practice .
What you see are two mustards laughing at , and what you see is that the bee appears to be like all of us in this superfluid .
But the desire is this — when you get the message out , it doesn &apos;t go away , and he &apos;s looking for the drawings .
( Laughter ) This is the ultimate hunger for the &quot; &quot; hat &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; bow .
It seems like it &apos;s a mash-producing thing , like coming out of the factory as if it &apos;s a latency or a hat .
What we do all the time from a very basic space , we feel like this consumer space kind of reminds us of it and makes us feel a little bit disturbing , with our own reflection .
And for us , this is the kind of grateful creature that is going to be able to bring our attention to everything that we need for our attention , but it &apos;s also a creature that we need for help .
What &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Cloudburst . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also a volunteer .
With the shape of the mind of his machine , his machine would make a measurement based on the size of the barrier from the front of the scene .
It &apos;s where I &apos;m from , every one of you comes from , every single one of you comes to that crowd , and the audience kind of takes on my whole visual field .
In Audistria , there are six small waves .
They learn how to expand mechanically by their own instruction .
It &apos;s rarely true that all of them can be solved if and when they want to swim , how strong and how they want to be brought back to him or how they want to be next , and whether they want to be married to this .
And even though the viewer is resistant to that , the copy of the incision , the tube receives a sentence .
It can be a few flags or a bags of hair , and the experience doesn &apos;t happen until the bone comes off the stage and the wind blows down .
It could be anything from a few weak hairs from a copyright narrative that can be a very famous innovation .
For us , I think we &apos;re looking at the script as if we &apos;ve experienced it or an organism that also has a sense of self in it as if it &apos;s an Indian .
And so the viewer can play a fairly heavy and engagement , like a great nightmare or a soundscape , but they can &apos;t learn to laugh at the barrier to get it right .
So there &apos;s a feeling of inclusion and desire and anxiety .
It also has the tensions and the press .
So if you see here , we &apos;re really excited about this , because you can put it into two hands .
This is a little animation , as if both sides of the walls get together in order to discover the hope and the influence of the world .
And you see this .
So we &apos;re not holding out when we &apos;re going to be able to grab all six of them .
Okay , this is a passive project . We call it the Flash of Rice .
It comes from its strength .
It &apos;s the one that &apos;s in our island , and as you can see , it &apos;s made out of three different fat particles .
And so we encouraged this to reinforce this word , that we would build our own race , or a network that would roll in the room , and the fuel would be able to achieve that great .
And there were few holes in that area .
They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if you were preparing for some kind of silence or a zero-g game .
Each one of these figures can lift and refine , and go in the way , and follow them for a few pairs .
So differently from the point of view of this , we wanted to be able to find out what was going on under the chains and what was going on and what was going on and what was going on , as if the trailer was going to make it a little bit more competitive .
And we &apos;ve come to believe that these lines dancing as if they &apos;re hardened and unlimited , as if they &apos;re nervous and experiencing them , until they &apos;re tempted into looking and looking out of the closest to themselves .
So this project gives us a little bit of acceptance .
These figures are kind of hooked up in this very strict circle of precision , which is kind of prison , but at the same time , it &apos;s also sustained , because it allows them to stand out for shirts and wives , and there &apos;s no need for what &apos;s going on in the outside world .
And so all of the things that have happened to me about curriculum is that I talk more carefully about getting into a relatively technical conference , and we &apos;ve been very lucky to have a general conversation with ETH , creating the first one .
As you can see , they took the width out of our multiplication and turned it into a movement that creates a movement of going forward and moving forward .
It &apos;s quite low .
You can see it in my hand .
So imagine our anxiety when we came to see him for the most mystic leading to him , and for that .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
So , you know — ( Laughter ) you may start a little bit slowly , in the first week , you do enough to drink the hard days of the day , all the press , keep you awake . ( Laughter )
And I wanted to do exactly that .
That was the plan .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happened with every rat .
I would have given the word that I had in my 90s with a certificate that I had to write in my book .
I said that for another employee , my tool would make a limit .
This is through a design project .
That &apos;s how it started .
And I &apos;m going to give it a coat , I &apos;m going to expand the clathrin and the back — I &apos;m going to incorporate the most sophisticated arrow as if I &apos;m going to lunch my lunch .
What is it that makes it difficult for them to wash sticks ?
They were special , right ?
I &apos;d seen the worst of all .
Those two months of the first ?
They came and went , and I didn &apos;t want to start .
And then , out of those months , there was one person who was going to die at the bar .
I went all the way out of the morning , had three big numbers of them , and I still had a word . The only solution : I wrote 90 pages in an hour , I drew not one , but there was no way for the city to do it — people would not stop doing it — I was following the city , added to slow it down like I had seen before the absolute .
I think that was the absolute thing .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There was no way . ( Laughter )
It was a bladder , a very blind sight . ( Laughter )
And I wanted to take it back to you when you all thought , &quot; This one &apos;s crazy ! &quot; ( Laughter )
And she was blind , she was thriving .
I &apos;m a writer of the link .
I &apos;m writing &quot; &quot; Wind What &quot; &quot; stands for .
For years , I couldn &apos;t write about procrastinating .
And I examined that , and I found that the T scan that would prevent me from reconciling the wall so that I could arrange them .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to sell you .
So this is where the hatred came from .
( Laughter ) And then ...
My skirts .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a difference .
Now , what does this happen to gratefulness ?
It turns out that everything &apos;s fine to be there .
&#91; Things are time to start . &#93; &#91; Hey ! &#93; &#91; Once upon the time of the Big Bang has decided to do something special , I would have plans of Beck that didn &apos;t like it , but she &apos;s taking over the government and saying , &quot; &quot; On the Perwegian East , there &apos;s nothing about the French Bridge , Tony Hing &apos;s Walk , &apos; cause I just thought this was happening . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Wow , that &apos;s going to take some lasses , and the bottleneck isn &apos;t going to be there for the jobs .
Their anger Bear is not the one that has to solve everything .
It &apos;s just this one .
She didn &apos;t remember what was , didn &apos;t tell me what was going to be there for two things : to be fun and to lose .
The animals in the world are doing it very well .
( Laughter ) And Beybee &apos;s people are still a whole bunch of animals .
You have to be exhausted , immigrated , and you have to be thriving , and you have to live on the summit ridge .
But if you think of it , we live in other days .
We live in a society in that society , and Beck didn &apos;t know what it was .
This is another survivor of our dreams , the Red Cloud Prize , which tells us to do what we do , the deaf insects , will not do .
We could visualize the future .
We see a collective image .
And he wants us to do something that &apos;s new to do .
Sometimes it &apos;s good to make fun and lenticularies , like when you &apos;re armed or preparing for someone , or embracing a new purpose .
They have their hand crossing .
Sometimes they do .
Sometimes it &apos;s good to make difficult , and not so nice to make the whole picture .
And that &apos;s where it comes .
I call this the clue of desire .
Child runs up when the government runs up and down .
When the CEO runs around Beck , there is a symbol of how the procrastinators are in the middle of the blue area , not in the wrong place where the important needs are .
And as it turns out , the processor has an angle of cheese that &apos;s out of the top , assuming it &apos;s the hardest of all — it &apos;s called the Monstro .
And most importantly , he &apos;s the only , creates his Bear .
( Laughter ) Of course I did .
It was almost my pleasure to be the last TED Talk .
Are we aware of what &apos;s going to happen one day in the future ?
We need to be there to start working now . &quot; &quot; And Beck said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m absolutely kidding you , I &apos;m putting together Google Earth and making a picture of India up to 200 feet above the ground and a couple of hours before we get to the top of the country to make it to India . ( Laughter ) So we did that day . ( Laughter )
When those months were rolling into the cave , then two , and then one , people at TED did not come out of the closet .
I came up with a website , and I remember my foreigner , who &apos;s in me .
And guess what ?
( Laughter ) So what Monstras did is they started coming out of it , and a few seconds later , they had a chair . ( Laughter )
And the Jealousy — you know , this Monstras has this horror — poop , they &apos;re not there !
And ultimately , the Red Clouds can take a walk , and I &apos;m — start writing a language .
Her Monstras describes all of the insane granted behavior , mouth . Something like me , with a sense of self , doesn &apos;t write the first letter of the speech , and then she finds the effort to make sense of all of the paintings and writing eight pages .
This situation with the characters is procrastinating .
It &apos;s not good , but it &apos;s working .
And this is me , and I have no idea to write the same story a few years ago .
When I did that , they stopped me .
People were frustrated and wrote how to procrastinate their lives , how to bear their lives , how to live their lives .
What are the other people on the table ?
In fact , there &apos;s a lack of granting .
And that long-term procrastination is a smaller footprint than a laughter , a little bit of a puzzle with it .
He &apos;s the happiest living in silence and loneliness .
It can lead to a huge amount of regret and regret .
They said , &quot; &quot; You know , they &apos;ve written such lawyers , and they &apos;re in such a disadvantage .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re preparing for a particular project .
This long-term gratefulness contained the breath of her own lives .
They didn &apos;t come together because they didn &apos;t succeed , but they believed that they could even start pursuing them .
I read those sticks , and I realized that , in my opinion , there are no procrastinators .
Woman : I think you &apos;re all grateful .
You may not be the same as some of us — ( Laughter ) and you may have known them for that , but you &apos;ll remember , the Big Bang is flying when there &apos;s no laughter .
I want to sell one of the messages to it .
It &apos;s a tendency for the Gulf .
This is a soul for every 90-year-old living week .
In the world , there are not so many of them , and especially when you know that we &apos;ve gotten rid of them .
I think we need to really look at the calendar .
You have to be aware of what we &apos;re doing to procrastinate , because everybody &apos;s life is procrastinating .
You should not forget the trauma Behind .
It &apos;s what makes us all .
And there &apos;s not so many of them , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s got to start this .
Well , maybe not this , but ...
( Laughter ) You guys .
Last year .
Wow .
( Applause )
There &apos;s a man named the Italian official for his son , who has recently been tested in a competition called Medal for his behavior , who has supported him .
All of the rescuers were a sergeant who , with the honey , went to a few deaths to the emergency room .
And what I &apos;m saying is that , on that day , the gray response , one of them , was one of the medications on the refrigerator that had an honest Good Street and was going to lead you .
You can see that the Italian Sson with his pocket doesn &apos;t make a solace , puts it into the field .
And then I looked at the end of the story , and where are these people coming from ?
What is it ? It &apos;s some kind of creature that you want to do that .
This is the original experience , and I wanted to find out , is there not people who do this to me ?
In the hill , we have these relationships for the people who have been tearing for others to benefit from us .
Everything is open , right ?
And the first thing I learned was that they were actually good people .
They &apos;re serving themselves for the next generation .
Those good people are there for themselves .
There isn &apos;t .
And his honor was to meet a few other people who were named after the hero , who was so tempted to save the others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; What is it that you do ?
What did that do ? &quot; &quot; And they all said the same thing , &quot; Because they would have done so for me . &quot;
It &apos;s a lot of excitement and generalization .
And that &apos;s really important .
The notion of transcendence and communication is valuable because it &apos;s feelings , not incisions .
And I can just say , &quot; &quot; Hold me , &quot; &quot; so you can do that .
Nothing .
Whether it &apos;s a fat weather , whether it &apos;s an extended weather , whether it &apos;s a tiger with a long , all of these forces work to make sure that our life is threatened .
So you &apos;re feeling the social therapy , the times we &apos;re living , the times we &apos;re working , the way we call circumstances , the motor where we &apos;re feeling part of it .
And for those of us who have been deeply embarrassed by the natural process of engaging and communicating .
It has privilege .
It &apos;s rare that I can relate to that and claim that some of the details are coming from the ground .
The modern world is exactly that .
It could be a new story , it could be your business to get through it .
It could be your own self that sometimes tends to kill you .
Or to push away from the business , I would see the smallest waves of shredding your plan to lay and take away your business .
We were hungry for that .
These forces work all the time , and they go away .
The only intellectual quantum is that in the same organization , and that &apos;s where the leadership came from , because it &apos;s what the leader makes .
The next plane would come up to the river , and I would become the lifelong lady : a few passengers tried to get to the airplane before I invited him to the numbers , and I would try to figure out how they were working for the inspiration rates to him , as they were doing with him , as they were pushing him down .
He was terrified that he was trying to get a little too early .
So I jumped in .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do with us as a disease ?
What are you going to do with us humans ? &quot; &quot; And she said to me , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the word for ?
&quot; &quot; Sir , I &apos;m not going to hold you down , I &apos;m going to get in the chair and I &apos;m going to get in trouble . &quot; &quot; And she said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , she didn &apos;t get you .
You don &apos;t get to your leaders .
We love to find out with the &quot; &quot; west Wind &quot; &quot; not because there are good employees .
We love because they &apos;re not afraid of their leaders .
You see , the conditions are meaningful , you &apos;re forced to make it into time and forces that are willing to surrender one of the things , and that fundamentally undermine our organizations .
The best palliative leader to a great leader is to be there .
What does it take to be good ? What does it take to become that ?
The big leaders want it .
They &apos;re about empowering people , they &apos;re about to break down , they &apos;re about to strengthen their brilliance , their brilliance , their ability to try and push and pull back , and that &apos;s that they &apos;re going to achieve more than we can identify .
These are the CEOs of Next Jump , who are the head of Next Jump , and this is the head of Next Jump , and it &apos;s the CEO of New York City that says that when you have in your pocket , do you think about empowering yourself from yourself ?
They &apos;re all there .
So what do we bring to people who are working on this ?
The next company Next Jump , you will never be able to afford due to a benign task .
Throughout that , so many people feel such an instinct firsthand , and there are those bank managers , the feedback unintended , and there are others .
The point is not in the poor .
The point is that they knew the most important leadership there .
They have collapsed the strength of social intervention .
This is what calls us . It &apos;s ridiculous .
What excuses would we give 150 billion dollars for that ?
Or what about the dollar ? What about the dollar ?
Did we do that ? Of course not . None of us will .
The Great Leader would give it a way of not having to worry about it .
They have their names for the fluctuations .
They &apos;d rather have people scraping their eggs .
And Chapman , the head of design , who runs the design of the design , lies in the middle of &quot; &quot; The Wall Street . &quot; &quot; And what he did is , he took a very deep recession , and through that process , he lost 30 percent of all her signatures .
In a large part of production , it rarely represents so much that they couldn &apos;t sustain their own power .
It has been 10 to zero dollars , and as many of the modern qualities , the government has focused on revealing the memory of the affair .
They didn &apos;t understand it .
Because there &apos;s no employees at all .
The employees are large , and it &apos;s incredibly difficult to overcome the scarcity .
It didn &apos;t decide to launch this program .
Her employees , from sexual weather to match , were signed up by four deaf details .
They could have affairs whenever and never necessarily have the four of them .
He said that I &apos;d better all suffer from a distance , that I would be willing to suffer from someone , and in that way he had employees who had come .
The leader is the hint . It &apos;s not the laser .
They &apos;re in power , and we &apos;re doing what they &apos;re saying because before us , they have authority ; there &apos;s no way that other people are assigned .
That &apos;s exactly what leadership does .
I had to hear a story about a few soldiers who were in the middle of the war , and as the Camp War officer is accepted , the CEO of the party , the government of the service , and allowed the first to treat his wife , and the good news was to eat the boss for the boss to sell the madness .
And whenever they drifted into the field , one of his people brought a little bit of feedback , because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders because they &apos;re the first one .
We call leaders because they value themselves so much that only their people will be brilliant , and that their people will have new , and in doing so , we will have a natural distance — our people will grow up for us .
They &apos;re opening up their own storm , weekend and tears for their leadership to be real , and waiting for them , &quot; &quot; What do you do ?
Who would have given up their own storm , weekend and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; And they would all say the same , &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
Is this not the kind of organization that we all wanted to work on ?
They are your credit for you .
Wow . Wow . ( Applause )
By the very best moments of our time , it can be solved by the definition of our own , that we have made it within ourselves .
And when I was there , I learned that the crisper of Christianity was that you moved from there to the real world .
I learned this from my grandfather , the Doctor Ruth Tauer , who knew that he had lived in the Andes Design .
This is how I grew up : I &apos;m willing to see the future without the eyes of laughter .
They were my contemporary experience of how I helped her work in a range of places in such dishes .
I &apos;m afraid of these things because they &apos;ve helped me understand the life beyond the limitations , the life with so many possibilities , without the language , the resources and other barriers .
These few , my grandmother , who &apos;s complaining about the Krilin &apos;s &quot; &quot; No one &apos;s hidden . That &apos;s it .
You &apos;re looking for them .
That &apos;s what you think of as mountains .
Get ready and waiting for me . Hey ! &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I became like next year .
All of the guns that we take for granted around the world have some kind of disease .
And they are , I think , capable of solving — part of the story that I &apos;ve spent my entire life working on .
It &apos;s the idea behind us .
They have the resources inside .
Growing up from the rice system to the emergency room and getting rid of it .
Being a guitar dog has to fight .
He didn &apos;t get it , because he had a hole in his belly .
It &apos;s about empowerment , and it &apos;s about gender .
We also know today that the lack of oxygen is also all within reach .
As you can see on the diagram , the dance hole in the hole is puzzling puzzles with the goat .
Video : ( Child crying ) When you look at the destruction of this , it turns out that they are long enough to hug .
The only treatment to make a hole in the size was a large operation .
This is my friend , Mr. May , who &apos;s all in the region .
The only intellectual one that didn &apos;t burn the outside was the lunch .
Then there was an adventure .
And we were bringing that word as a form of lifespan for our first invention .
They can be with them .
The red is the bladder .
And as soon as I can tell you this , it was the first time I tried to build an impact on this huge scale .
In this video , you can see how the very little incentives send their rhythm to the heart .
The entire tube has a hole .
Their moments of accomplishment were successful at creating and developing the waves .
That &apos;s what they needed , and that &apos;s what they needed to do for an hour &apos;s worth of work .
And hopefully , if it affects , it can save lives .
I came back from Vawaiian to the whole thing , and it &apos;s that wherever we go , we can do something good .
His wife and partner Ali Heath , we started accepting us .
And the threat of healing with us is that we have a very , very strong impact on it .
We live in a place that is more than six in the heat .
And they need a special tool to cure the destruction of the individual .
And the gender of the victim of life is different because the coal between the arteries is bigger .
Many of them cannot be treated by lasers , and they die .
The first-mover was able to cure just fine on the inside out .
They were researching .
We brought forward to the first planning .
Throughout many of the specimens , with my grandmother &apos;s locations , we built a new food .
In America , local women would tell stories of the horrible scripts of the struggle , and unprecedented mystery helped us innovate .
We took that into a traditionally-based approach , and we turned that into an envelope that was made out of a strong wheelchair that records the form .
It seems to us , in this laser , that we should be fueled by this wild drink that doesn &apos;t hurt because there &apos;s only one part to do .
He can deliver himself the immense amount of intensity that he has required to eliminate the amount of time .
As you can see , they &apos;re putting themselves in a hole through natural alleys .
Doctors need to put a cat in a hole .
Our expansion of ourselves flows , opens up the edge of the limb , and makes a hole .
We have this beautiful system of law that is beneficial because it affects ourselves .
They were the realities of open surgery .
( Applause ) In the way we treat them , we treat them with diseases that require a lot of luck and a lot of coal to cure them — that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
Cheka is there before he &apos;s there .
You can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , whereas they &apos;re located there , they &apos;re 100 cures .
It &apos;s only 30 degrees below the summit .
It &apos;s very good to look at it and the human side .
And it makes us happy that some of the bottles of apartment are part of our team — the team , thanks to the ones that work with us .
Once we have one ideal , we only have one idea : We should have better care .
We &apos;re not there to create something new .
The door is not a race .
There are many obstacles .
We bring strengths from our own .
Their assumptions are quick to get their power and their courage to suffer .
Our goal is to make sure that they are unsupported by governments , not by teaching or assuming .
So you have to start with one and one .
We give one of these tools to make sure everyone is healed .
We are in many countries now , and you need to be everywhere .
These were all things that existed with all the unpossible force , and we were floating , and it was this : nobody would ever die .
They &apos;re just like that .
( Applause )
I grew up in Limpoo , on the sides of Limpool and Mumalanga , a small town I &apos;m dealing with this .
The water and the purpose of that was the same as the air , and growing up in those conditions of rigid , when I was 17 , I was longing with a poem of friends and we were burning in the field .
Hindsight is a good thing to do .
When you &apos;re anxious , a friend of mine and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Come on , do you have anything you can put on a skin and not have a chance to fight ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Honey , I &apos;m going to buy something . &quot; &quot; I came back and I looked at it and I looked at it , and I was shocked by this angry thing .
There are five of them out there in the world today that will not be tied to water and water .
450 billion people live in Africa , and five billion people live in Africa .
The emergency room conditions are so extreme , the primary condition of those diseases is tremendous .
It seems like it &apos;s an infection in the eye where the eyes are closed , and what traffic infections can do all the time .
This one covers eight billion people every year , and the amazing thing about this is that you avoid the treadmill of an infection is that you don &apos;t want a veggie , you don &apos;t want a climber or an incision .
When I moved about that flow , I finally said , &quot; &quot; Even if I &apos;m arrested about myself and because I &apos;m not going to get the treatment , I should do it to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my own admiration for the world of Noah 64 — I didn &apos;t have any idea about this , as far as I &apos;m concerned , as far as I &apos;m concerned , as far as I &apos;m concerned , as new as I
That came out of the CFC art of something , you know ?
And then , okay , I had a formula .
The current terrace is to get it right .
Throughout that year , when I wrote 40 pages on my own lens , I blame myself , and when I wrote the patent in my own illusion , by the way , I &apos;m the greatest person in my country has ever had a patent on my country , and — ( &quot; &quot; The crash of peace ! &quot; &quot; ) — the more I don &apos;t want to hurt — ( Laughter ) I get to DreyBritish . &quot; &quot;
By hitting the skin and not fighting the skin .
( Laughter ) And I was encouraged to build this in my own education , and then I had a very limited connection to it , and I went to see a few people in the room , and I put some people in there , and now there &apos;s all kinds of stuff that I &apos;ve done in my work , and I &apos;ve got to look at the market , and I &apos;ve been able to get them there .
We learned a few lessons when we commissioned and we went to DreBath .
All of them , in the process of learned , are that poor bonds don &apos;t flow through the big numbers .
They buy it when you need a little bit , and the person doesn &apos;t buy a whole bunch of cigarettes , buy one cigarette every day , and that &apos;s it .
So we started getting DreyBath into a little bit of clarity .
High on the side and shout .
The fun part is that the whole thing constitutes one feedback at five elections .
When we blow that up , we then add something else about it .
We found that even the rich dreams of the city want new DreyBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
We estimated that in this way , we could grow 80 billion liters of water every time we lose grassland , as well as growing waves of water every day , every day from scratch , two hours of school , two hours of homework , two hours of homework , two hours of extra dream .
When we had this universal benefit , we removed our primary attitude , our primary attitude , our primary attitude , to create it .
Drew Bit is a rich man &apos;s advantage , and a poor man is a vital asset .
We &apos;ve tried this out , and now we &apos;ve got a legacy behind it , with the help of the local community , with the help of the collective collective , one memory , that I &apos;d like to invite the public , on the brink of Limpox with 50 items per week , I &apos;d suggest a way to unpack people .
What stops them ? ( Applause ) I didn &apos;t mention them . I didn &apos;t mention them .
Other important things , because we learned through this , Google has selected me one of the smartest dogs in the world .
I am also the best business sector in the world , the first African continent to celebrate , and the strange thing about it is that I didn &apos;t like it because I didn &apos;t like it . Thank you .
( Applause )
Five years ago , I was in the metropolitan atoms , and I was in the midst of coming back to this path of educating .
I spent the time in 17 years , actually , since I became a management consultant , I dressed out a chalate and saw it happen .
And they &apos;d spend the month there , and they &apos;d stopped me .
And I was waiting for myself , or are we going to focus on outdated reproduction , or do we not forget about it ?
There are many countries you can push , and where I &apos;m from , have access to health .
It creates a part of a partial limitation .
And many reforms pursue this growth of particles .
On the other hand , new dreams are retired , and they don &apos;t get there .
In many places , the treatment and the nurses in some way are the tax of government .
Their inclusive health incarceration has been accepted .
Their waves come into it , you have to operate on the old and weaker .
So by suggesting that when you add a doctor &apos;s guess , you can put that in and out .
Finally , some physicians will say that they will not fill in the gray basis of what their manners are best for them .
And I &apos;m sure some of my stuff is crap .
BCG : We looked at the memory , and we asked ourselves , is it a good way to organize a healthcare system ?
So we got a little bit back and we said , what are we trying to get there ?
Before the test , in the healthcare system , we are trying to build our own destiny , and we have to make it very limited .
We call it the health benefits .
We &apos;re in the middle of me watching what they say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; What are the treatments that we have with our prophet ?
It was a beautiful description of the year that I published on this , and Elia was down in the desert .
What you see here is my gentleman crying into three beautiful dots .
When the BCG started doing the work , we didn &apos;t have to pay so much attention to the cup , I would look at the quality , and all of the people who were most fascinated by the peak , we saw .
Their emergency room for hospitals is able to find unbelievable good , for those of you who are dealing with them , they are incomplete .
The warriors were open .
We have Erick come here from the explosion of prediction , and he needs surgery .
And at the end of the day , he can go to Vawian , he can sounce the gorilla into the helicopter .
He &apos;s going to go to the emergency room here , believing that after treatment , he doesn &apos;t have a marker about 50 percent ; he has to have a new skeleton .
That &apos;s when you hit a monet . 50 percent of it . That &apos;s quite a lot .
He went to Hamburg , he went to Hamburg , to the March Canyon , which was only five percent .
So you get a moneton , and you get a whole lot of stuff out of your pocket .
This is the size — the quiet times — the difference .
When you look at a number of hospitals in different diseases , you can see that they can make big differences .
No matter what you don &apos;t know , no poverty .
It doesn &apos;t even exist .
They didn &apos;t bother them .
You go to the hospital , you know ?
It &apos;s not like that . There &apos;s hope .
In September 70 , there were these kinds of orthopedians that came together in the year and talked about what they would find new surgeries .
On the left side of this chart , you see a rule of metal detailed labor of labor , creating the pancreas for us to achieve something new .
They all know that their surgery matters .
And they argued that &quot; &quot; My way is better , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know any of you really know it , and they admitted it .
So they didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; We were going to have to measure the quality , then we would know and be able to learn the best way . &quot; &quot; They would understand the years . &quot; &quot; What is the quality of the surgery ? &quot;
And as they got closer , they began to see and share their medium .
They quickly emphasized that if you put the ceiling on top of the barrel , before you put the metal strength , it serves for much longer , and many of you will never have a second surgery .
They &apos;ve promised the medium , and it has resulted in a country of excellence .
And they saw it matters .
And then they would sing their daughters every year .
The next year , they would try and find out : who &apos;s going to drink , what &apos;s going to happen ?
They would come to each other to learn — that &apos;s what they would learn .
For many years , it &apos;s probably the best people in the world , the ones that are equal , and many of them are .
I love this principle .
They pick up , they say , what &apos;s cool , they start measuring , they share the medium , they discover the best and the message .
They &apos;re constant .
It &apos;s not the only half of the pink .
It &apos;s literally an exciting one .
They had all of them in the equation , and they had a look at her , that those who had achieved quality were also the lowest resources , although that was not the primary goal .
There was another time to look at the history of surgery , and within a couple of years , there was a sudden silence in the history of the United States and Sweden .
There were some things that had to be operated seven years after the first operation .
The United States has been three times larger , it &apos;s in Sweden .
We celebrated OEden .
Occasionally , there &apos;s a fascination about the quality of the affair when the hand is given to the refrigerators .
For many diseases in the United States , the quality of the disease is lower than the average , yield Oxford .
Her USDA estimates that it would take care of the quality of the quality of the United States , and it would expand its quality to the OEU , and that would save the United States for 500 billion dollars a year .
That made 20 percent of the country &apos;s health bias .
What you have to say is that the cheeks are unexpected , that there is anything for you , is it possible ?
It would be the belief of our health in the prison of our health , and I would say , not only could it be done , but should be done .
The private health system is the treatment and the nurses .
The only thing about the whole thing is that for the news that they get there , looking at the quality that they get for the idiot .
They were always the better off .
We were in good shape .
And if someone can sell the news that what they &apos;re doing for themselves is nothing better than what they &apos;re doing for themselves , they &apos;ll do whatever they want .
But many of them didn &apos;t .
But they also have another self .
They have other recognition .
Her generation calls the next generation , working in another hospital , and he says , &quot; &quot; Well , that hospital is achieving so much better than that , they will prioritize .
So by measuring and generating a hat , we reduce the constant growth cycle , as we see in this area .
Most people would say that it &apos;s beautiful , that it &apos;s not just passion .
It comes from the mystery .
We create a global bendery , a global bendulum in which we can stop and support what we &apos;re achieving .
Once you give them a set of statements , you will find yourself in the field of business , and the Carolina Infirmary in Swedish , the BCG will form what we call SRMTK .
Tell me that cheating is not a cheating thing , it &apos;s a scream .
He reaches out the clouds of the Supreme Court , and he calls out all the horrible stuff .
We get to one of the best hospitals and treatments , disease after disease , which is the quality of the quality that we need to cure and anticipate that tissue .
They &apos;ve been working — harvesting harvests for years — cats , burning pain , dressing arteries , dressing arteries , getting it , for instance , with the danger and the danger of productivity .
They would put their fingertips on the page .
This is the first time that we elevate our societies , not just in these countries , but also in the modern era .
In the next year , we plan to get eight diseases , 16 more years later .
For three years , we have to preserve 40 percent of the disease .
Welcome two like this . Is it better ?
What &apos;s the word ?
Five months later , I was teaching the largest North Pole in the hospital .
They have a new way of doing it , and the marketplace is , &quot; I want my own owner to build these quality , important for the people . &quot;
And on that day , we were drinking a war on curriculum , on nurses and on , we were drinking about the ice creation .
And we said , how can you measure the quality of this ?
Can we do that better , what are we doing now ?
And we were wondering , what is the significance of improvement ?
And we were wondering , what is the quality of a cash for my grandmother , could it be the measurable ?
The beard was filled with energy .
There &apos;s so many masters , there &apos;s plenty of hair .
In the abstraction of the liquid , the liquid came back .
And he looked at everything , and he said , &quot; &quot; I forgot , he put his hand up — put his hand up , cut his hand up , and he said to all the &quot; &quot; Ah .
Still . Since we &apos;re in big trouble with something that this hospital has been doing right . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve been looking at the health care system , which is not just a cash , but it &apos;s also a thing that makes us think about doing things like personality in hospitals and other health systems , not just a part of it , but a part of it .
It &apos;s because the advantage of health is about trying to get a translation , and I think that the modern station , the beauty of it , the creation of the universe , the most important , the smile of it .
Wow .
( Applause )
I &apos;m excited to be able to spend some of my frustrations on the discovery of what &apos;s more relevant to the power of companies , what &apos;s really important about them , to bring the underlying company .
I believe that entertainment companies are the best way to make the world a better place .
Her own people , with the right incentives , and whereas they go to the starting company , they can open up to the unthinkable human race .
They can achieve extraordinary things .
But if the leader company is so great , why is it so great ?
This is what I wanted to do .
I wanted to find out what matters to the company to follow .
I wanted to celebrate the year for a moment , to escape the frame of deaf judgments , and to be absolutely exhausting , dedicated to the creation of many , many views of companies .
I wanted to know this , because I &apos;ve been trying to figure this out since I was 12 years old , when I started out in school , I sold a salad on the floor , when I started in high school with nuclear power facilities , when I started doing my garage .
We &apos;ve learned a lot from these failures .
And I started looking at some of the paintings that were lacked up to the gratitude and failure of companies .
So I looked at these pennies .
Hold up , hold up .
I used to think that strength was everything .
I called my company &quot; &quot; the hell , &quot; &quot; because I appreciate &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; the first when the first came out .
But for the past , I began to believe that maybe a team , an acquisition , was far greater than the seat .
And then I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get this synchronizing Martin son on the TED stage , but one time he said , &quot; &quot; Everyone has a plan before someone walks him into the leader . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s the right thing to do .
From the dawn of the dawn , the poorest of the dawn shows that they can apply to the shift from the cloud .
The left is the real thing .
And I started to realize that maybe a team is the most important subject .
Then I started looking at the business .
Does a company have a very clear road map of how the generations are made of climate ?
In my mind , it started to come to the concept that maybe it was the most satisfied thing to do .
Then I looked at funding .
Occasionally , companies would get a big funding .
Is that important ?
And then , of course , time .
Was the rush word too early , and the world wouldn &apos;t hate it ?
Or early , but you also have to learn the world ?
I &apos;ve collected 100 companies and 100 other companies to look and find out something systemic about it .
First of all , these Italian companies , top five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , Gogh , Zucus , &quot; &quot; Tickback &quot; &quot; — have achieved the threat of dollars .
And on the top five companies at the bottom — &quot; &quot; Zen , &quot; &quot; Insider Page , &quot; &quot; &quot; yourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bill &quot; &quot; — we didn &apos;t expect them much , but they didn &apos;t .
So I decided to rarely respond to these references , as I was told , how did companies follow each other ?
And then I looked at the hotel , not the &quot; &quot; rain &quot; &quot; companies like &quot; &quot; No to &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the hell &quot; &quot; Uber , &quot; &quot; YouTube , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at .
And a couple of clubs : &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; &quot; King , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start , &quot; &quot; &quot; Floos &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; marriage &quot; .
The enterprise companies had strong funding , and some of them didn &apos;t even turn around , but they didn &apos;t .
I tried to look at the characters that lay closer to these companies &apos; thank and failure , and they stopped me .
They were number one .
The label was important for the success of pushing the separation between gratitude and failure .
This company was saying , &quot; &quot; Once upon a recession in a drink , &quot; &quot; when people needed extra devices , and maybe it helped people to overcome their admission to define their homes with strangers .
The same with Uber .
The soldiers were looking for extra value , and it was very important .
Before the anxiety of our guidance , Citysearch gave a word when people needed a web .
&quot; &quot; Goat , &quot; &quot; we came up with this . TED , it occurred when the companies were searching for their X-rays to shake it .
We thought it was great , but it was really a big deal .
And then some of our failures .
We set up a company called Zucas , which was a company of mine .
In 1999 , 2,000 width of the battlefield was slow .
It was hard to look at the visual cortex of the person who had to put them in a browser and do other things , and the company finally got caught up .
After two years of avoidance , when the crash came out , &quot; &quot; Aye Fuh &quot; &quot; and when the spread of a bypass is over 50 percent , whereas I &apos;m making a lady .
It &apos;s driven , but it &apos;s not fake time .
By the way , before the label was launched , the label didn &apos;t cry .
So in summary , I would argue that the achievement of this is important .
It &apos;s also very important .
But time can be important .
And it &apos;s better to measure the time by the customers , whether they are in denial of what you have to offer .
And it turns out that these laws will allow you to achieve some of the more severe setbacks , and to do something great for this world , which otherwise wouldn &apos;t happen .
You &apos;re very , very good at this .
( Applause )
I was a gorgeous student . There was a lot of hope before me , and joy started coming out with a real life , a story , a long story , a long story , and I put it into a ridiculous laughter .
There was a lot of unhappy feeling inside , undressed and scared , and I was afraid of other people , going forward , failing and the frailty that I felt inside .
I walked out of the panel when everything was going on . I walked out of the panel , I grabbed my foot , as well as the dogs would ever before , when I heard a voice , I would say , &quot; You &apos;re from the person . &quot;
I thought , no , there was no clarity , there was no real sense .
&quot; They opened the door . &quot;
That was the start .
And he survived through the big and volunteer , complaining everything in the third place .
&quot; They &apos;re in the lecture . &quot;
He was hungry , you know , and even after a little bit of lunch , he was kind of messy and confident , and sometimes I would have told him that he would reflect on my trailer .
For example , when I was this , and I hid it , and I hid the songs , because I was immersed , the white man was confused .
And then there was a guilt slogan in there , that people would find their voices , and that I heard him , it turned out that somebody was mad to me .
My university physician told me about this physician .
And while I was longing for an interest and an assistance , I told him about the fourth comment .
For example , I worked for the existence of this , which broadcast the black and the living thing , and during one short talk , I said , &quot; &quot; I found it , I need it .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing , I &apos;ve been embedded in the courtyard of events .
I was sent to the hospital , I was given a diagnosis of a diagnosis of a crisis , and then what was going on , what was going on , and I was struck by a weird who was suffering from the long jump , the vulnerability and the feeling of inflation for myself and the future .
When I was nervous to look at this vote , not like a patronizing , but to that one , my chimp and my wish had increased .
So I decided from my point of view to my own mind , it was like I was an illuminant warrior , and I started hearing more voices , and those white speakers were coming up with me and ashamed .
Do you see that sterile water ?
They walked up to the bathtub , the avoidance , the missing circle , and that was the wheel in which it felt helpless , not to find a place , not to find a place .
For two years , my condition was severely angry .
I had all this crazy rehearsal : adulterers &apos; voices , absurd hallucinations , cathedrals , unspeakable activities .
And yet , when you were in that crutch for a long time , something seemed to be dead , but something was saved .
A mouse was frozen and attacked by a man , but the person who came out of it was a capable and eventually grew up in the arts that I had to become .
Through my life , many people have been inspiring me , and I have been moving along with me , but these things borrow before the people who have helped me .
I believe Eleanor can come from this .
Sometimes the hell will be there , but the hell will be there , but the hell will be there . &quot; &quot; 14 of them are not enough to pick up all the good and good people who have been there with me , and who have been waiting for me to come out of that farm and settlement .
It was very hard to prepare at the beginning , because the voice came from becoming curious and threatened , was the first thing to do — to learn how to separate the meaning of the formal meaning from the familiar , to create before it .
For example , the voice that threatened to fill my home taught me to marry as my own tobacco and insecure in the world , not the real world .
Before I &apos;d known them before .
And the conviction of that , for example , was one of those slaves that I sat behind the door of the sleeping so that I could get away from , as I got back , the real voice threats .
It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t sit with me .
You &apos;ve got a hint , do you see ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s true .
This is what I &apos;m saying most of all , I &apos;ve assembled my parts . Every mentor has got a voice , and I &apos;ve come back and I &apos;ve come back to the field of my dreams , but on the other side .
There &apos;s a lot of joy of being on the International Net , an organization that is International Hearing for the parts of Movine . Her immune system has been influenced by the fossil fuel , Maris Rommy and drama . SEscher &apos;s work . You &apos;ve got the voice of being on the line , the health of the mind , not the spot of the parts of the world , but the chairs of
Their society is not only possible ; it &apos;s real .
Reframing Church &apos;s dictionaries , looking for social consequences , not being able to translate them back .
You can &apos;t tell a person who &apos;s good for you .
It &apos;s about dreaming up people who don &apos;t feel bathroom .
At the age of 20 , Heart &apos;s future , has inspired the voice of the hearing grid , the five-step hardware , the collective work of athlete and loneliness , and there are many other people who are armed with the power of surgery , creating a new language and an elderly , a new hope , a hope that from the grassland of an unburning grace , a burden of un@@
As Levine said , the man is the creature of this experience , decreasing himself to be self-healing , and the only legitimate access to a new capacity .
And in that gap , in public debt , there &apos;s no greater honor or or or for being able to help the process of recovering , there &apos;s the rest of it , there &apos;s the prosthetic arm , the sharing of it , and there &apos;s hope for survival .
We &apos;re special . We &apos;re not invited .
What &apos;s in our inner city , nobody &apos;s ever going to be there , except that one and the other .
This is never going to happen .
Because one of the common treatment for me once has said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what people say about you .
Tell me about myself . &quot; &quot; Oh .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to force my own self .
But is that what it is ?
Because it &apos;s not enough to handle it , it &apos;s not possible for the deaf to be able to do it .
However , my interest in this came when I acquired my first weekend for a five-week period .
It was a transition with my anesthesia not to paint , but it was a little different because the new contemporary of the universe is planning .
And what they do is they bang it when you don &apos;t have a button .
So I got her to be in the right place at the right time .
I was told that everyone could do it .
And what I wanted to do was create something different , something different , something that was inherent when I didn &apos;t have a button .
Things like this : A few labels go through a bunch of black pants .
But there &apos;s also no shame .
And without that , authenticity will survive .
Or take pictures like these : both of them are spiritual and colorful , but with the same purpose : preserve reality .
I mean , &quot; &quot; real &quot; &quot; I mean the real thing .
Because , of course , this is not something that you might be able to assume , but I &apos;ve always wanted you to come up with , as if it were possible for you to come up with someone in a way that was perceived .
These are the cells that require a brief moment of thinking to understand the deck .
So , I think it &apos;s important to make a difference , not the actual reality .
But what is it about cleaning , making it real ?
Does it have something to do with it or with it ?
Does it have to do with sanctity ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes silence is silent and illusion .
But ultimately , the key is , how do we understand the world , and how that might be , in the spirit of the spirit of the world .
It &apos;s not original , and we think it &apos;s real .
So I think the bottom line is quite profound .
I &apos;m actually seeing this as a real-world box where different pieces of real-life can be used to paint to create alternative reality .
Let me show you the application of this .
There are three great representations of this , of this , of this , that will confront the world around us .
But in a way , they can create something that &apos;s still pointing out to them , that they can exist .
But at the same time , we know that it is .
So we regret the wall because they don &apos;t usually accept it , because it doesn &apos;t really make any sense .
I see the same thing and connecting the fingertips .
This is , ultimately , a distribution of real innovations .
So what creates the creation of a genuine purpose , I think , is something that we don &apos;t even accept , is something that will make us live on our everyday lives .
But if you combine the fingertips , it &apos;s very important to get the captain , because what I &apos;m doing is I &apos;m literally showing you something unlocked .
So there are three positions that need a leader to achieve the real thing .
As you can see , there &apos;s nothing special about this .
But they can create something like this .
So the first thing is , you have to have your fingertips connected to that same thing .
The second thing you need is a similar location .
These two pictures are filled with both requirements : they are going to be fueled in the same heat and in the same heat .
Their attribute : not being allowed to be separated , where different images are coming from and where they are going .
It wouldn &apos;t be possible to tell you how the image was made of .
So , by combining the specimen , the stones and the bicycles of the stencils and the landscapes of the separate images , the ideal implications of the financial debate as lunchroom , coincidentally , removed the boundaries of each other , and in a way , they remove the boundaries of each other , and in a way , they discover that the visionary
So there &apos;s another one going to disappear .
( Laughter ) And some might say that it &apos;s just natural , and just the reward is the ride .
But the picture of the subjects is all about percussion , doing different locations .
I assume , historically , that race is to create a place for it , not to find it , because there is no need to find a compromise for peacekeepers .
It requires a lot of planning .
When I managed to get this maze , I knew that I would have had several months to plan , find different parts of the box .
For example , the word was fossil fuel in the boat .
The cracks are from different places .
And then the scout would bring some of that into the backyard .
And yes , I even put a house on a red salad to report Swedish .
So in order to achieve the real thing , I think it &apos;s important to plan .
Everything is always the ideology , the passion .
Then we combine , we combine the different fingertips .
And that &apos;s where all of the pieces are very powerful , aggregated .
They &apos;re good at providing the resources that they can be quite beautiful and really innovative .
So all of our rare tools are accessible , and the only thing we need is our fantastic .
Wow .
( Applause )
Their way of doing that was to create a mysterious mystery that was carrying around the world .
We had a back immediately .
Iceland resisted them .
It &apos;s been estimated that the rollercoaster of business is worth two and a half percent of the U.S. dollars , connected to the President of East , the Waldimate , and his trailer warrior , the tension of the mysteries .
There are more turtles that will inspire new stories about the next generation of them , about the next one .
It sounds like a rollercoaster for John Grie &apos;s novel .
I &apos;m not a person with us ; I &apos;m a person with us .
What are the calls that should be challenged ?
Before that , if rich and powerful assumptions can hold temporal offshore and learn lessons , it is less than low levels of all services like healthcare , education , dementia .
It &apos;s important for all of us .
Our &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; organizations &quot; &quot; are bringing all of these things to the public .
Local mistakes and gender leaders think that the space of an offshore can be used to hide our beds , and we &apos;ve been announcing this for a year .
I think a lot of the offspring plain isn &apos;t knowing how it works .
I &apos;m visualizing it as a graphic .
It can be in another way , and it can be in another one , and it &apos;s difficult to see what &apos;s behind all the seams .
Through that , it &apos;s hard to do the right circumstance , and the teaching institutions , the magazines , the prophecy for the blind , it doesn &apos;t make any sense of what &apos;s going on .
Because the fact that the power of the event didn &apos;t seem to be in the United States .
It doesn &apos;t mean that there are rich lawyers that are carrying out hair .
So this is the case that Mossack Fonseca has a smaller client in the United States .
I think if they were to come from the Canadian Islands , they were crying , the Woman Army is down to the government , they would see a lot more coming out of the closet .
And the addition to this is the round school employees to expand their grandmothers , their cheeks .
It affects all of us .
&quot; &quot; Their education &quot; &quot; wanted to know how the offspring showed up .
These were just low settings , these lawyers didn &apos;t take them as customers , and the ignorance wasn &apos;t translated , and yet the system was there .
It &apos;s important to say that it &apos;s not an individual street .
The idea of how you do it , how you &apos;re willing to engage the groups , how you &apos;re going to fix the message from the grandmother .
Unfortunately , the U.S.
They wanted us to estimate that those who are there , that we should be looking at this global warming open world in the United States and the world .
We , &quot; &quot; it comes from , &quot; &quot; we see it as a clue , that it &apos;s time for change .
Religious , the business leaders will say , &quot; The secret business is not about everything . &quot;
They need to admit this to this , and they need to support the law .
Once we can assume the hidden assignment that causes the conditions of avoidance , the rivers , the fluctuations of ignorance and so forth .
CA : Good afternoon , that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s been said that the hell of a hole on the Leave during the last few years is going to put more blades on this earth , and the war on this global warming is going to happen .
Could that be ?
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , can that be ?
The conclusion is that the pressure of the world works so easily , that the activation of the event will allow the participants to express more effectively a sense of understanding of information , the way in which the world plays a war on war .
CA : What is it like ?
How do people feel these people ?
And how do you ensure that friendships ?
His name is : You can tell them that these people are , in a way , blurring information for the purpose of information , there is no way that they can handle information .
We are bringing new concepts of schizophrenia to this sensation , despite the footprint , until it enters countries like Switzerland and prosperity , isolation and acceptance for surgery .
And we get this mail from the mail , from the mail , from the grocery ark , from the fact that we know it as an entertainment of news , from the format of our iphany , which makes it pretty hard to do , because it says that there &apos;s a lot of information out there that &apos;s all that we &apos;ve heard about , and our own devices , from the inevitable rightedness of the right and the
( Video ) Narrator : Come on , you &apos;re going to make sure that you &apos;re real , but you don &apos;t know what the source of information is .
Audience : It &apos;s the study . We know very much about these revelations , and in some point we &apos;ve learned about this , it &apos;s that information we can harder to do so much faster .
( Cheers ) They will .
( Laughter ) Knowledge : I think there &apos;s a story about how to become a TED Talk . ( Laughter )
They &apos;re there .
You &apos;ve been searching for something for a few years .
They can make it possible to sell it .
This one happened in Kenya a couple of years ago .
Can you tell me what you &apos;re looking for , and what &apos;s the time that &apos;s gone ?
Audience : That was what the report was .
It was a secret rule of thumb that Kenya ran under the market in 2004 .
Ideed . Kenya was roughly 18 years old , Dam ark Moi .
He was Kenya &apos;s herd .
When the government came to Kibya — with the Calais , which was trying to support the Kenyan River , they ordered silence , and for that time , the war on any given income was spending about two billion pounds .
She was given the information to a government that she wanted to help herself complain against Moi , who was — and there was only a rich man in Kenya .
This was the deputy of Kenya .
So I went there for years , and we &apos;ve got to get the information before the market — the next one is the word for the word .
We invited the report last year , after the new presentation of the November , after the new presentation of the Civil November , to tackle a man who was forced to shout — Del Ark Moi . &quot; &quot; And so this report is to celebrate the preexistence of Delhi , not enough .
( Video ) Chris : So in general , you can tell that the report was coming out of Kenya not from the green box , but it wasn &apos;t down . Your opinion , it took the market out of business ?
His name . This one said , &quot; &quot; The Guardian &quot; &quot; the first page , and it was published in Kenya &apos;s Central countries , in terms of what it is and what it is in Africa .
It came out of the outside .
And a few days later , it might have been a big click to Kenya .
In this village in Kenya , there were 20 watts transmitted and , in Kenya , the Kenyan government estimates , 10 of them invited to vote , and they took a selection agenda .
CA : Come on , your search for the world is going to change the world .
His name . Hi .
( Applause ) Knowledge : I want to give you a quick video clip of what &apos;s coming out of the edge of the video .
The video is long ; it &apos;s just a short story .
I want to warn you that the dog is not about the younger people .
They said , &quot; &quot; ... fudge , &quot; &quot; once you could , you could open .
We have this idea of being on the wheelchair , moving one second ...
Good . Okay . Good .
Tell me when you clap it . Sorry .
Shake it all .
Get on , hold on !
( Cheers ) Cloudburst . Share . ( Cheers ) Shock .
The dog ... Bless you see it , Bless Mr. .
It has to be moving , it has time !
All right , we &apos;ve just done eight of them .
In other words , we see two pockets of cheese , and it &apos;s even cool .
Okay . We &apos;re there .
It says , &quot; &quot; Hey , you &apos;re moving .
Up , sir . What happened here ?
They could , &quot; &quot; Who . Okay , ha-ha . &quot; &quot; I got it .
CA : So what was the calling for this ?
Audience : The stories of the people who did it were there .
We went to see two people to come far away from this story .
Chad just three attacks of the first attack that happened in this place .
( Video ) Narrator : There were 11 people in this attack , right ? Two news agencies at Reuters .
His name : The Reuters &apos; employees , two dreams of marriage .
Eight to 18 to one .
( Video ) Narrator : The light of this message has shattered the global gap .
What did you think was the basis of the misconception ?
( Video ) Audience : I don &apos;t know . Maybe there are people who have bad forces .
These are the people who don &apos;t have the courage to be there , and the Arab swear who is behind him , and each one of them has a 30-plus agenda , a search for the brilliance and the names of the people who want to save the margins .
And then there were two magazines who didn &apos;t believe in the makeup , who work in their real work .
( Video ) Narrator : There was a U.S. government agenda called Black Manning , so he realized that he had this video that he had transmitted to you , and the war and 280,000 secret postcards of the United States April Street .
Did he do that ?
His name is : We &apos;ve come to accept these wilds .
Five of them gave him that accusation of 150,000 wild fields and waiting for him to go .
In the beginning of this year , we &apos;re looking for a slum from the US Ambassador , and it &apos;s not necessarily the case for the events .
I want to tell you that I was in this ambassador a song to come .
CA : You &apos;ve had a thriving set of battles in the United States right now .
His name is : We &apos;re going to be searching for them . ( Video ) CA : Really ? No . ( Video ) Anderson : Come on . ( Video ) Anderson : King ? That &apos;s what happens . ( Video ) Again : Well , because that &apos;s what defines the truth about the real estate , say , with the power of the country , the hope of the spirit of the people in the state .
And when you look at these blank lines , it &apos;s exactly the same view .
( Video ) ( Video ) Narrator : I &apos;d like to make it a little bit longer .
What is your operation ?
What was the right thing to do with the data ?
Audience : It &apos;s the field from what &apos;s relevant to the world , what &apos;s the power of information , what &apos;s the power of transformation .
There &apos;s a lot of information .
The ones that are inherited by organizations that are linked up with the sky and the things that are out into the outside , the ones that are good at this , the ones that are hoping that they can achieve something in the gallery , and the settlements that are there for them , the things that go from the beginning to the end , the tendency is to make that information hidden .
That &apos;s what we came up with . But that &apos;s what makes the damage .
CA : But are there any of these recent aspects or even societies that information can lead to insignificant consequences ?
( Laughter ) Audience : It wasn &apos;t our expectations for information .
I want to tell you that there &apos;s a lot of immunity in the time .
There were veterans when we had the information that we could hold in the arts — from scratch , we could identify with aspects .
I think there &apos;s a discovery when it &apos;s right to be transported , and for example , when it comes to health , it &apos;s a rule of mystery , and I think our countries who are comfortable with information are really going to need to be done .
CA : You &apos;ve got to do that .
And what you said , of course , to be honest , to be honest , to be known as the US military , to say , &quot; &quot; People , you announced what you wanted to do with the rich mothers .
It turns out that these three generations are laughing at death people .
It &apos;s made an impression — it &apos;s made an impression of billions of people all over the world that their soldiers are unintelligent .
That &apos;s not the case . There &apos;s no sons . What &apos;s your friend ? &quot; &quot; What &apos;s your response to that ?
Audience : In other words , we hear the songs .
But remember that people who were there , the people in Ie , the people in the room , they don &apos;t have to look at the video ; they &apos;re all there every day .
They &apos;re not going to get their opinion . They &apos;re not going to get their grades .
That &apos;s what they think every day .
The video can bring up the opinion and get the people who are teaching for it , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So this is a way for you to get a hint into black companies and government secrets ?
This is good .
But does it reveal to you that if you try to extract the mystery of others , you are secretly holding your information source ?
His name is : It &apos;s all right . We didn &apos;t bring up all the Leave dishes .
We don &apos;t care about the resources that are going to be there for the poor .
They will find themselves , and we will have this situation , and I have my work remain so that people will be able to support the support of our narratives , not necessarily .
CA : I would have been able to find out — what you &apos;ve just heard about — what the TED Talk is .
It &apos;s understandable that there can be different opinions about Leave and doing things .
Or a hero — that hero , carrying a smile .
Or the magical one .
What &apos;s his laser ?
Who thinks he &apos;s magical ?
His name .
( Video ) Narrator : Chea &apos;s going to get touched , that &apos;s what he sees .
I have to fake it . I have to put it on the other side .
You &apos;ve got somebody you haven &apos;t been looking for yet , but you &apos;re going to do it at TED .
What is it that has just come up with this idea ?
And talk about it .
Audience : This is our painting , our everyday activities .
Throughout his years of anger , the mystery , there have been a number of remote controllers in Albania , similar to the Mexican visit , except for the masterpiece .
We got a report — a particular type of incidence where they were writing that apprentice employees from the curriculum , from the foster officers , from the service of the Arctic Council , dedicated to the department of those who were there .
They were influenced by this , and part of the Albania government .
The Information Collection Collaboratory did not have the funny information , so it was a particularly powerful one for us .
And we wanted to look at him because we didn &apos;t know what he was writing , even though we found out what he was talking about .
And so we &apos;ve been looking at this quite skeptical , and it &apos;s possible that there &apos;s some sort of extra intelligence behind the fossil record .
And we put it back into the country , and we say , &quot; &quot; Well , we need to look at the skeptical .
We don &apos;t know what we can do .
They were coming out of the spectrum , right , but we were just waiting to look at it , and this week we got a laser from a collective who wrote an assignment to find out what was going to happen to the fossil record . ( Applause ) They wrote that they wanted to eliminate the source . And we said , &quot; &quot; Keep a concert .
And that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you assume that you have the right to discuss ?
Will he be waiting for you ? &quot; &quot; And then they came back to us with a graphic image , and on Word ID , they were hungry for us .
Okay .
( Applause ) And it comes quite a song .
It &apos;s kind of like one of us who we &apos;ve been trying to identify with each other , and that &apos;s what we want to look at , and that &apos;s what we want to look at , and that &apos;s what we want to look at , and that &apos;s what we want to look at , and that &apos;s what we want to look at .
CA : Have you got some information from the GDP workers ?
His name is : So we got a lot of information , but this year , we &apos;ve got intense landing and tech jobs .
These are our publishers that have been flying through the last few months , because the original debate for the interest is now on the basis of their core .
The interest rate is on top .
Since all of us started having an educational organization , we &apos;re very excited about our growth , and it turns out that we are gaining tremendous amounts of information that we &apos;re creating for the rest of us , I don &apos;t have enough people to incorporate and store that information .
CA : And what borrows the possibilities — or is there a lack of urgency to do magazine , or is there a lack of traffic jam ?
Office worker : Sorry . And delicious people .
I want to say that we are an organization that &apos;s struggling to grow so quickly , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do with our sense of self , and we &apos;ve got to make sure that we have people who have the capacity to deal with the sacrifices of the victim of the victim of the golden industry , and also there &apos;s plenty of knowledge .
( Video ) Narrator : I &apos;d better understand that , tell you how you got to that point .
I &apos;ve read that there &apos;s a lot of work I &apos;ve done on it that I &apos;ve learned in different ways .
Could that be the case ?
( Laughter ) Audience : We had a tension in the business of a cinema , and we had sex with you , for those of you who are there .
( Laughter ) Knowledge : Psychic says that it &apos;s something that you can eat .
His name . Who , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : So , you &apos;ve got a phone number that you &apos;ve got , and it &apos;s pretty much the same for the right eye .
His name .
All of this has become an active journalist .
I conducted a poverty , and for doing so , I was overperforming an adult .
They need to be careful with it .
I want to tell you that this is all there , the design that can be done in the future .
Unfortunately , as I approached him , the most sophisticated version of the mafia is to follow your old bank account .
Their brand is not as pleasant as it was before .
CA : Well , I mean , I &apos;m actually saying you &apos;ve got somebody else &apos;s bank collection . What is it about the basic values ?
Could we harness them , could we tell them about an event that took them away from them ?
( Laughter ) Audience : I would have told you .
And I would consider the fundamental values of this — smart , elderly people would not share their gods , they would suck .
These realities remained from my strength and from other smart , elderly people who came to see my life .
Who &apos;s a son : Are you happy , people don &apos;t stick their own gods , they scream them ?
Audience : Right . You know , I &apos;m in a position where I &apos;m not in a position where I &apos;m not in a hurricane . But in a way , there &apos;s another way that I can argue with you , and that &apos;s to give justice to judgment .
This is somebody that I thought was very smooth .
CA : So tell me very short , in a minute , what happens in Iceland ?
And what the heroes of the herd , the Iranian borders of the bank , after that , were encouraged to tell this story .
And they announced it .
This is what happened to me in Iceland , which was a great poem . What had happened far ?
Audience : That didn &apos;t inspire her .
Iceland survived funding .
Each country was a tough attack .
The country &apos;s banking sector was 10 times the size of GDP per capita .
However , after the last year , we published the report .
And the experience of alleviation was zero for five minutes to translation , and as a movie would tell you about the drama itself to the press , and the weekend would say , &quot; You know , you &apos;re not a Buddhist . What &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
They had all this time in all of the time as an invitation to us , and we had a very , very famous moment in Iceland , and we were driving around , and we were talking about these things .
In a society , the feeling of kindness that this would be no longer a service to the service , and the fact that the incident was there was that , with some Iceland and and some other judgments , we had a new set of rights for the Iceland , who let the Iceland be present to some of the official addition , that within a world , there would be some faith in poverty , there would
Ianland is a north country , and as Norway , it can empower the system .
Last month , it was the only accept Iceland .
CA : That &apos;s it .
( Applause ) The world &apos;s memories of it , of course .
When you think about the future , how do you think it &apos;s going to be — or the Big Beach is going to lay down a hole , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more silent , are we going to push the Great Bush , or are we going to be able to guess ?
His name is : I &apos;m not sure for that , and it &apos;s going to lead everything .
There &apos;s a strong warning that if we &apos;re going to harmonize the word &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; to find more pain in the world — it &apos;s happening all over the world , whereas in the switch , in the U.S.
What about it ? It &apos;s easy to predict .
And so this is an interesting year for us to live now , because the change in everything or the perception can be seen can be completely undivided , our government will lay down one ark of a couple .
( Video ) Narrator : I think I &apos;m going to say the opinion of the copyright : You know , you &apos;re going to be rejected , and I &apos;m going to threaten .
( Video ) Narrator : Oh , Chris . ( CA : Wow . ) ( Applause )
Good afternoon .
My name is Ulda .
I was from Rwanda .
I connect the balance with the interface of this idyllic , the ethical , the beauty , the beauty , the passion , the arrest .
I &apos;m going to talk about a project that I &apos;m going to talk about , which is called Daddy &apos;s Roman .
I &apos;ve taken that blank and placed a new , contemporary reality , and it &apos;s talking about me in Rwanda about the remembering people who are not there , but there &apos;s some fascinating stories .
This boy is a long-standing dancer , only 12 years old , but in the middle of school , he says that he is , and he doesn &apos;t carry the bullshit , he wants not to be restricted by the kidney as if he didn &apos;t cry .
This boy has the faith and the brilliance of it , but he has to be accepted , because he has to be different lenses , especially in Roudo .
Some of them are shaped by pairs .
And this is the kind of thing that everybody from the barbie to the South will defend .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t given it to you . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you say in the movie , but I never gave it to you .
He &apos;s wearing his sensitivity , his romantic side , because in Route , like heroes , there &apos;s no way to be romantic , but there &apos;s no way to be surrounded by a woman , and to discover that there &apos;s a sense of self .
( Laughter ) Sometimes in my project , I take that goal and make it a new meaning and a new meaning for it .
Sometimes they would follow up and they would light up with the dictionaries : You know , the person you know compared to the person .
( Laughter ) In my teeth , I reveal social symbols that make me in Rwanda .
Interestingly enough , this notion of the novel in Rwanda that for many , 18 , 19-year-olds , they &apos;ve already been scratched off , and they &apos;re trying to find out .
We have learned from that that that that sacrifice creates a life of happiness , a lot of details , that it creates a good guy .
What about me ?
I &apos;m 27 .
I &apos;m older and unhopeless for social progress .
And then you see me and Mexico put me in the back of the line with her yours in a long way .
But you know , there &apos;s this one , and it &apos;s what I do to motivate girls to pursue goals , hungry and criticisms .
Be bold . Be bored — that &apos;s good .
Be flexible , make a magic .
( Applause )
I &apos;m Jane Gonigal . High Scholarship .
In the world of desire , we are more successful .
And so far , every time around the world , everyone in the world has signed up at 5.93 billion years is going to be solved by the island of Azeroth .
And it doesn &apos;t have to be there .
We step back into the bendroute because there are other creatures .
And the consequence of that is truly social change .
These are billions of people that benefit it every month .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to solve .
His job is fine . He &apos;s expected .
But that , in a sense , is not the case .
You have to start making real affairs that are more like gravity .
In addition to the light bulbs , we had wedding cans .
People suffered . People died .
It &apos;s everybody &apos;s feeling it .
According to the word , after 18 years , the king had no idea that he needed a dedicated park .
You want to visualize the epic adventures , and then give people the tools of making news .
We put it in a Jewish way .
It &apos;s going to be a misconception of it , and it &apos;s going to be somebody who &apos;s going to keep going .
It has got a narrative . It has got skills as a place of judgment , a lack of knowledge , a value , and it has a look at the resources .
The larger larger model is just a small amount of force , to open a billionaire of conductors that make up this year .
And that little force of mine is a sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A full room of female mothers , a full room full of room rooms .
Woman singers .
I admitted my calf what it was worth to sleep .
This year ago , I got out of the prison .
I could get in my desk , I would wear a damn tumor , a blind person in the eye .
Then I began to rediscover the forest .
I was learning from that time , and I was speaking to the physicians , the scientists , and I was here to tell you that a few of us are awareness , a greater appreciation of influence and a more immersive life is to exaggerate .
( Applause ) We , mothers , will be accessed by this new revolution , this new feminine .
We reach out through that , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because , you know , the extension of this man has become equal to the man .
I recently went to see a guy who had been treating it , that he had been there for hours before .
And I wanted to say — I didn &apos;t say — &quot; &quot; People , what ?
He &apos;s five years old , and the warrior is going to be so interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , it &apos;s kind of like a misconception agenda .
Especially here , in Washington , if you &apos;re going to meet each other , and you say , &quot; &quot; Will it happen to you in the morning ? &quot; &quot; And I might say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m too late , but I &apos;m going to know the truck , I &apos;m going to meet some bottles , and I &apos;m going to meet it . &quot; &quot; They think it &apos;s very , very important , but they &apos;re not — they &apos;re not , because we
That &apos;s the I.Q.
It doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s a good leader , because the essence of leadership is to be able to put a gun in front of him before he gets there .
And our early adolescence has already been crushed through many hills .
In fact , I even find that if the British people in me were the gift of a bra and sister to me , they would not be an awful lot .
( Applause ) While all British officials would be an island party for the Buddhist , and they would be supported by the wall , because they would be halfway through the 7,80-hour mile , and they would be able to put a picture together .
So this year , when we face this vast amount of worldview , what &apos;s good for us , what &apos;s good for us , what &apos;s going to happen to the rest of the world , the gratefulness , the silence of our lives , the things that improve our generation are better and the world .
That &apos;s how you get to memorize them , and you find a great adulterer , and you learn how to seek out the barriers and discover the forest .
Wow .
( Applause )
This one is about how the visualization needs to value this .
At 14 , I first came across a fairly humble view , which is the network of the championship , the crutches of the junk , the soft light for the same thing .
And I use it today to create long hopes for the hopeless people who are desperate to make it , for the most well-intentioned people in the world .
They seem like I could take it .
There &apos;s never been a sculpture of fluctuation or engineering or peace .
Before the test , after the battlefield , you were dressed to seventh grade , and all my dates were open .
I started a volunteer student and became 10 years old when I received a proposal from the Fullbrize program , the Council of Education , and the traders of Dream , to go to India .
I had a lot of hope to give it to my parody , and I sent it to my lunchroom and I went to an absolute town .
The conclusion came from the parody , and I didn &apos;t see my goals anymore .
I had to do something .
The wheelchair was a famous affair .
So I tested bronze fate .
I &apos;d seen enough of the dilution of the skull of the skull , this tool was too difficult and hard .
I went out to the bedroom to talk about , I stood for the Jewish people who send their way to the valley on the sand .
I &apos;ve seen it every day , but once I looked at it , I didn &apos;t understand it — a new ability to create sculptures , a new way to create tattoos without tough , etc . , etc .
The first cloudspotted skull was created in a general fight with those gaps .
This is a couple of &quot; &quot; What the hell you &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We dropped the scaffold off .
I came up with her gentle hearts , and I came up with each windpipe , and I &apos;m constantly standing there .
That &apos;s my hippie .
I was far learning how to traditionally and communicate with people , and I was in love with them , and I was in love with the city of Lietnam and the press .
I &apos;m very comfortable with the design , I could express my work , but I wanted to make it bigger to make it bigger to make it into something that they could become the consequences of .
We brought it back to India to work with hardware , and we put it on a network with half a billion hands on it , and it was a little bit of a risk .
Thousands of people saw her , and one of them was the one of them that I thought of as an adult who was designing for this anger in the city .
He would claim to me if I could recognize it as a long-term urban farm .
I didn &apos;t know if I could , in some way , fit into my own culture .
Growing up those lines is good , well-constructed , long-term , like accepting excellent for those and shortcuts .
Two years later , I was looking for an ox that would hold up the long column , a soul , a weather , a trace , and the same strands of remain frozen up in the wind .
We needed something that would hold the web above all around us .
So we &apos;ve gone out to 45 , 40 pounds , about 20 , 411 pounds of steel .
We had to design it so that we could barely move with the wind and retain the maggots .
There was no projection program that could give you something specific and moving .
I came up with a brilliant tax of people who are designing bubbles for the names of the bubble , that &apos;s it .
He helped me challenge the magical challenge of getting out of shape and landing .
And I went far back to build the same way , because the arm would rig up at the end of the day to hold the cave .
And so I shared with them the nature of this network , and I learned how to build their own power , and how they don &apos;t need it .
I had no idea what it would be like to translate that parallel to an ancient loss into the industrial procedure to make it .
So we had to design ourselves a zero-g .
Three years , and — two of them , we &apos;ve saved 50 &quot; &quot; 50,000 feet , about 15 &quot; &quot; 240 .
It was difficult to pretend that what I had just imagined was a tattoo , a longing and unlost trauma .
( Applause ) This was all about him , and this was it .
It also has meaning .
These are the first time they &apos;re going through the sculptures .
I was trying to figure out how the wind was producing this , and I was looking like I was gathering a prize , and the same way that I was writing a towel .
Our life is no longer the same .
I want to create these scales of wild cities all over the world .
I &apos;m going to talk about some new stuff that I &apos;m working on .
The existing ancestor of the mystery of the myth was that they were there , I felt it was necessary for a race than a web to create a skull .
And so we got there with these dirty little pieces of water that we created a drought-tolerant crop that could be used for wind , and in the experiments we found also people that could be able to share all of this stuff without having to look at it .
And I give it this agenda to regenerate the shirt on the real plate , which is like a sleeping chart .
What the challenge is : &quot; &quot; Who are there ? &quot; &quot; The peace and the peer says , &quot; &quot; The Big Bang of the Sense , &quot; &quot; the organizers have collapsed , or I could visualize the 35th anniversary of the valley and the collective of them in one hole .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t imagine starting with it , but I said yes .
I read about the mystery of the Chile , and the black and white , crawling through the entire Pacific .
He removed the Earth from its wild lungs , restored it as if it didn &apos;t , and remove it , crushed the Earth day .
I got in touch with NOAA , and I went out to see if they &apos;re releasing the farm , and then I got into the Swiss .
Their assumption of &quot; &quot; 1.o , &quot; &quot; the reaching units that have shrunk the earth .
And I asked her to come up with it as a tool , a new steel edge .
Her offer was too extreme .
So I put a metal artery in mind a click of a click from it , 15 times a flock behind the steel .
This sculpture was already there without wisdom , and it was so lucid that it might have been there and just be part of it .
They had their own perceptions of the software that could design those same rich networks and try to make them look at the grave .
That &apos;s how we build it .
And then I got a phone call from New York ; I was asked if I could put my height &quot; &quot; for a thing or a &quot; &quot; Line &quot; &quot; sign .
Their way of thinking enables me to design and build skulls that make them look good for the sky .
While they &apos;re still there for funding , I &apos;m already there to bring the sculptures to many , many cities in the world where they &apos;re desperately necessary .
At 14 , I was looking for beauty in a traditionally-based classroom , that &apos;s it .
I &apos;ve been talking to the hotels on this day and engineering to build a patriotic hunting for the future .
Our deeds are expanding .
I &apos;m going to argue that .
I got a call from a friend called Phoenix .
And the injury that never caught menu would never prevent the music of the local people , respected all that he could , from his work , and made it possible for him to come out of the heat .
What was the intense amount of grass on the stairs was the four blogs , besides the strangers who were identical to the discovery .
That &apos;s you .
( Applause ) Whoa , whoa . Whoa . Oh , whoa . ( Applause )
If you want to understand this chart , you need to look at the talented tail of your clothes .
We lose our sense of self when it comes to us .
They &apos;re doing it for months .
( Applause )
Before that , I became a farmer &apos;s mother &apos;s height .
You &apos;ve ever seen somebody before before , and you even know that both sides are completely disconnected from the curve .
I got up . Oh , it was very pleasant . ( Audience : I &apos;m not sure . )
They send energy every year through all of our family &apos;s memories , and it creates a kind of multi-dimensional image of how it reveals the heart of the road , how it marks what it says , how it feels , how it feels .
I &apos;m the energy energy energy industry , with decent energy , put that into its own foreground .
We &apos;re at this moment where we &apos;re in one , and we &apos;re all alone .
And the way we look at it is , the way we look at each other — it works differently .
Our hearts are about half the time we think and time .
Our cards , half of us , are going to think differently .
All I could look at was energy . It was ...
I wondered what would happen to me .
Have a hole in the hull . Imagine that .

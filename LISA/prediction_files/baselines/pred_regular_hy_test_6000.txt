Until the end of this planet , there &apos;s a billion billion people going on social networks .
They all had one thing : Everyone would die .
And yet , it seems to be a pressure , I think that it has been a very common consequences , and it &apos;s impossible to study them .
So this is what made me think about this — this — this — this is the first year after the Dutch Children , and he was blown by the media , and he spoken by the media .
He had his family and friends told that they were in such indiction , and then he said after his death .
That &apos;s what he wrote .
So , &quot; &quot; Oh , I had died , and this is my blog last print .
And I was asked that when I was asked that , when my body was righted by cancer , my family planning , and my friends have been published this idea , and this picture was a very active page . &quot; &quot; Because Mr. Michael Sh was actually a passionate program , and it was probably a really improved , but it &apos;s really helped to make a lot of us in the past , but it has evolved to be completely different systems that has been
Just look at the statistics .
Now , in the sky , every minute they &apos;ve done it for 48 hours per year .
Every day of 200 million people have written in .
Fourth Floullli is just an electrical thing on the Fourth of the Fourth , and it makes it a piece of the Fourth .
So , when you think about your parents and their parents , they &apos;ll be able to make some photos , and they &apos;ll be able to watch a photographer or something like that .
And today , we all make this wonderful thing that we all create a very rich motivation , which is going to make it go back from the cloud of years later .
I think the techniques for techniques to create this , it &apos;s some easy opportunities .
You &apos;ve got to say that I &apos;m a technologist and a technologist , and now I want to talk to be a little bit like the future .
Now , we know some of the service that we need to help us to decide what &apos;s going on on in the social media and the social media after we die .
One of the things I found myself when I was buying the Fourth at New York in New York .
( Clease ) Assnol : Hunday .
More : Is that ?
AC : Yes .
MA : The death can find you everywhere — even every hour of food .
AB : Who &apos;s talking ?
There was a collector , a lot of T...com. , too far later .
( Laughter ) AG : It &apos;s a little horse , right ?
That &apos;s the way that allows you to create a text or a text that you can put on Facebook , after 10 .
There &apos;s another way called &quot; &quot; 1,000 members .
It will allow you to create the musicians to create online in a fashioned amount of positions , photographs and images that are able to send after your death .
But in the future , there &apos;s a lot of things that are interesting .
Most of you may be familiar with Robert , who was still a newspaper at the newspaper that he could detect more than 90,000 hours of analysis .
As the way that the cars can understand the language of human language and transformed into a huge amount of data , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to look at the entire life , all kinds of details , collective things like this , we create a lot of efforts .
And I think , after some time , I think our digital content will be able to continue to communicate with the real world since we are building the whole thing about the whole technology , and we create the technology to wisdom .
Now , we can see some experiments .
The other thing called &quot; &quot; My next two weeks , is going to solution all the data that you &apos;ve written on Twitter to predictable what you &apos;re looking at .
At the moment , you can see the results that the results are going to be born .
You can imagine what this is going to look like five years later , 20 years later , a technical improvement .
Another thing ago , the Martifactor of MIT has worked on robot that people can communicate .
But what if those robots can be used to communicate on a certain human creatures that are based on thousands of pieces of pieces , which is based on the human life , which gives you a lot of life ?
Finally , I went back to this famous video , which was at the U.S. night of 2004 when the NNNational N.K. , the mastereo B...K. , the mastereo closed by putting their research out to the K...K.
Now , what if we could use these technologies to be used by our lab with our living living living room , that are quite quite fooled in different ways that they &apos;re able to build content on their lives ?
I think it &apos;s possible to be able to be able because of our data data and technology has been able to understand , and it &apos;s speed .
Now , to tell you what I think we all need to think about , is we all want to think that if we want to be the reality of it , and if that is that , and then what does it work with everything ?
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Today , I &apos;m going to talk about discovering .
I work in a lot of technology .
My company is trying to reduce people the environment to get away .
And it was detailed to the balloon .
This is a short video of what we do .
Hoke an hour .
Let &apos;s wait for a moment , until it &apos;s done it .
( Laughter ) First of all , we can open the opening up — I &apos;ll just leave you on the stage , I &apos;ll open the video . ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) It &apos;s not — ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The technology ...
Oh , I gave me time time .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I love Internet .
Right .
Let &apos;s remember all of it .
All the service that we use , communication , communication , transmitted , transducer .
And it &apos;s happening in our days .
I &apos;m more sure we &apos;ll make sure that one day about what we &apos;re going to do about about our time — that our generation has come into the Internet , which has created something powerful and truth .
But yeah , the truth is also true that the Internet has a lot of problems , very serious about security and family .
Here .
BA : It &apos;s a flexible movement .
5,000 feet of flexible motivation that you wear in a BBlus , which is the first BM .
And when we keep bombed , the bizarre shocking was written by a soundscape called 601 , &apos; 601 , the bottom of the forest .
By signature . This is nothing in a way .
And they &apos;re trying to figure out what &apos;s going on .
I turned down to Google .
But it wasn &apos;t there .
I spoke to the labels .
There are a few people in the corporate gus .
And one of them told me that if the UUSSSA means Russia &apos;s land at the city .
Indian cities . You can find this in some phone for some mobile phones , machines , machines .
It &apos;s a financial heat , etc . , etc .
And after revenue , we found this picture of the EBBM , the boy worked for a few years .
In the Internet , it has its own website and his website , and his blog blog blows at this YYung blog blog .
Since your life expectancy — he &apos;s about 20 years old — he &apos;s about his friend — and his friend has a beautiful car .
In fact , this guy &apos;s doing this .
Men Bh.B. in B.Sm. , 12 miles into a motor , more strateurs than a city of Spain . It &apos;s a baby &apos;s head for a car .
As I learned about this car .
Because there was a car about the car .
He was crying .
They had never been under the house in the middle .
He was driving the car , another car , and he wrote pictures of blogs .
And here , her Museum — this is Lupper September , which is the volunteer , you can see the Olympics of SOlympics .
And it goes down to 78 , if you look at the scene .
The 10th is a tratrade of 600,000 to 601 — I &apos;m not a lawyer .
But if I would say , here I would say , &quot; &quot; Grap came up . &quot; &quot; What if the crime was arrested , &quot; &quot; What would it be that very , very , very , very , not going to go ahead ?
The majority of those are even the majority .
We don &apos;t know where we are attached to crimes if we can find crime .
It was very often . The Doscope doesn &apos;t work if the politics doesn &apos;t work .
There are some stimules that are not going to be done . I &apos;d like it , everything &apos;s easy .
But unfortunately , it &apos;s not the case .
It &apos;s very quickly . You &apos;re probably heard about the Frix .
Scott was measuring the most important thing .
It &apos;s done all of this . It &apos;s the real Park PL .
In a software , it &apos;s controlled . And what &apos;s the infrastructure .
That &apos;s where we control around .
PPPL , small boats , no no .
Anyway , programmals are shaped and doing their work , for example , at this building .
It &apos;s actually interested in one of them . And if you &apos;re one of this poster , one of them is this .
And then there is a global revolution , and the conversation we have to care about it because it &apos;s successful .
We have great infrastructure .
You go to any farm .
Imagine a chemical engineer , a factor , look around you — everything in the air is doing everything . Everywhere computers have computers .
It &apos;s all going to make these artists .
We put it on work .
And on the other side of the networks , electronic tattoos , obviously you have the computer , and it &apos;s really designed by computers .
In a whole new problems , we need to do something about our work .
In a different way , if you have computers , even if computers don &apos;t wave .
( Applause ) Think that we can work when we don &apos;t even work with things that are not quite important .
Now , in the moment , the mystery thinking about thinking about it , is important to you . Now I &apos;ll say , I &apos;ll say .
( Laughter ) I like the Internet . Hans , we have all the Internet .
If you think , it &apos;s all about you .
If one day , what you don &apos;t have to do with them is the Internet .
I see , but I &apos;m afraid we &apos;re not going to see it because I &apos;m afraid of crime , because of terrorism .
So we have problems . This is the only one .
It would unsurprised us all of this .
I &apos;ve spent all my life on the Internet on the Internet , and I really feel that if we &apos;re not fighting it , we have to survive everything that &apos;s going to make together .
And so we &apos;re going to do it . We need to get more international , international .
The soldier to do the work of the network to discover these organizations , are interviewed by groups that are killing the rows on the damage . This is more efficient than the destruction .
There are programming out of networks like this : the most attacted attack attacks on this day .
They are discovering people and more important , we need to be able to be involved in the network of people who are going to be right , but still don &apos;t have people .
But without the opportunity and give them opportunity to use their values to use . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Now , I &apos;d like to start with you , just think , let &apos;s just give you a couple of minutes of your body size .
But before I would ask you to think about your body , how do you do with your body .
How many of you have it ?
Sometimes our hands .
Sometimes it works . ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
Take what you do right now ?
We all connect us to a body , a language , and the terror .
We &apos;re interested in , we say — ( Laughter ) — you know what &apos;s going on on on a bunch of stuff — taxed , taxy , directly at the eyes of a long time , or even in a little text .
One thing : Yeah , they &apos;re going to go into the village .
And even in Mathma Matma and New York Times .
And so it &apos;s going to think that when we &apos;re not thinking about a psychool or buys , like farmer , social media , that &apos;s not what we call a bathroom , but we call the language of language .
And when we think about communication , we also think about communication .
And there &apos;s a three-dimensional experience that this is to ask the right thing to do .
We can often poom up with a shirt and wrong ones .
And they can have a lifeeding part of what you can do in a significant life , in which case you &apos;re working on , or when you put it on a ticket or a risk .
So , for example , from the University of Tunisia , found that when people look at 30 seconds , people look at the time with a transducer and a real music with the real doctor , their love of the doctor , their doctor &apos;s despite to sell their heart , didn &apos;t take it back to that woman , no .
So they have to use them , right ?
In our ideas , emotions and the social skills .
And so , not the introte of communication ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study the leadership , and I teach business , inevitable school , and he was going to start with the conversation in the dynamic .
I was especially doing the power of the power and the authority .
Do you feel like the power of a force and the power of the authority is not the use ?
In the social world , animals are basically physically talking about the way .
The size becomes bigger , more at least .
It &apos;s a bigger part of doing it .
So Tony &apos;s concerned this kind of unconscious , which is known as a spiritual , and find out .
We put ourselves into a shirt , we don &apos;t want to eat more than the person .
That &apos;s what it looks strong and let people meet .
When we stand in the room and a strong person , we will die , you will lose the volunteer .
I &apos;m looking at my favorite students in the audience , and I &apos;ve noticed that business management was really a really master .
They &apos;re going to do almost two things .
Whether others are married at home as well as you see that you &apos;re going to listen to .
I have some notes in this way .
Women are doing more often than men .
They &apos;re constantly creating a lot more women , and it &apos;s not surprising .
It &apos;s especially important for business management to manage an exercise , because it &apos;s about sharing the conditions .
The business leaders are still struggling for a long time to fight this gender .
So I decided , like , for example , taking these people who participate in the classroom .
There &apos;s a lot of assumptions , yes .
For example , we &apos;re spinning when we &apos;re happy , but when we &apos;re going to have a kind of coffee box , you have a little bit more happy , we become happy .
It &apos;s on a side side , and it &apos;s in the lands .
The second question that we &apos;re interested in is : We know that our identity makes us change our body , but can we change our body size ?
Now , in this case , what I mean , why do you know ?
So one of these are women in a different way , who are far away from the mission ?
It &apos;s not surprising that people have become stimulus , more stimulus , more optic .
They &apos;re really thinking that the winning out of the winter , when it &apos;s a question .
So these differences are very often . They give risks .
But in fact , it depends on how we &apos;re responding to stretches .
Do you want to have a strong wheel , a high-level level level level , but the door responses respond in stress ?
You don &apos;t want to have to have you .
So we have a discipline that the body can identify , at least at romers , and also , and also the change of the changes can transform .
So what happens is , you &apos;re going to be a new role in terms of what &apos;s going on , if you do it , it &apos;s a very small , a little change .
Here &apos;s some more .
So you can sit on .
Here &apos;s the human miss .
You &apos;re going to be willing to eat .
In a hospital .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re going on .
Here &apos;s the whole experience .
And here &apos;s a gostic skeleton .
All of all two minutes , and you have two minutes .
And here &apos;s what happened to be trained .
And it turns out that our body decides the way that it depends on not just around us , but in fact , our lives .
And then , in fact , our body is affected by our identity .
We think we can use that to use you to appreciate your friends ?
It &apos;s not about what you &apos;re talking with others .
So it &apos;s about what you &apos;re talking to yourself .
That &apos;s what we want to try .
It looks at five minutes .
The whole five minutes in the entire European Union , which is worse than you ask your question .
People don &apos;t have to take it to them . MA , for the people , the Mitaria .
And so so there was an expert specialist at four studies .
They were fascinated with trial or experiment .
One of the emotions were important in that conversation .
It &apos;s not only how people aggregate them .
That was all the same interview of the interviews .
I encourage them to shape so much until everything &apos;s going to do .
The answer was they said .
They don &apos;t want to be virtual ; to become sure .
When I was 17 years old , when I was walking around .
I was out of a car from a car , a few times the captain .
And then I went to the brain to reconclusiate replacement .
I knew IQ , because I was always smart and talent .
I was moved from college , so I tried to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to switch .
I &apos;m not sure .
You have to be safe and hurt .
I mean , what I wanted to do . &quot; &quot; And so I did that . &quot; &quot; And so I did the college manager .
I had that feeling , and she had no idea , and I understood his culture .
He can take it to everything .
He had changed .
And so I want to say to you , just cut it out to you .
So when you take it back , you get it to me .
Art it &apos;s not until it became a profession .
Well , I want to reduce you the end .
The little horses can lead to a lot of change .
It &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s how to do you ?
You take your push up on your mouth , get off the rate rate .
Let me give you a message that you can &apos;t show your resources .
Thank you .
What I would like to talk about is actually the biggest problems .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; Tony &apos;s environments &quot; &quot; even though it &apos;s good .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to talk about who are the biggest problems ?
But before I go , I &apos;m going to ask all of you to try and find out of paper because I &apos;m going to ask you how to show you how we did .
So take paper and paper .
The sun , there are lots of problems in the world .
I &apos;m just going to mention some of them .
700 million people suffer from starvation .
One billion people is cleaning water from water .
Two billion people , it &apos;s inevated by inintrums .
A few million people die : AIDS .
And this is going on .
Two billion people &apos;s risk of climate change , etc .
There &apos;s lots of problems .
In the world , we all would solve it , but we don &apos;t now .
We don &apos;t actually solve problems .
And if we don &apos;t have them solution , then we need to ask ourselves , and then in this economists , we need to say , &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t do that , we don &apos;t have to ask ourselves , what should we solve ?
And I &apos;d like to give you the question .
Let &apos;s mentioned 50 billion dollars for the next four billion dollars in the world , what &apos;s going to do for us ?
We found that the most important problems in the world , and I &apos;m going to read food , in climate change change , politics , education , financial financial education , financial accorruption , corruption , corruption , corruption , corruption , corruption and corruption , drugs , drugs and drugs .
We think the challenges among the world .
One of the most obvious question is , what is it going to look like , what &apos;s the most important thing ?
What would we start with these problems ?
But the question is wrong .
And this was the most important question that he was removed by January of David .
Of course , not right , don &apos;t get people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve those problems .
Of course , the biggest problem is we all die and die .
But we don &apos;t have to solve the solutions , right ?
What &apos;s not the problem of problems with problems with problems , but in some problems of the solutions .
In that case , you can do that , of course , this is a better situation .
The climate change should be solved by the Rio Rio River .
The disease needs to be solved by the hospital &apos;s hospitals and vegetables .
The U.N. Community to peace peace , etc . , etc .
I want to ask you to try to try 30 seconds that I know , it &apos;s the way to give you an inversion of what you think about the most popular insights .
And yet , here &apos;s the bottom of the economics — you say that we don &apos;t need to let .
What would it be the last list ?
Please , 30 seconds , you &apos;re talking to your neighbor , and you &apos;ve got to mention that must be supposed to be the biggest challenges in the world , and more searching .
The most amazing process of this process , and of course I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to give you 18 minutes — I &apos;d already mentioned to you — I was a lot of time in my time .
I &apos;d like to help and think about it , and that &apos;s what we did .
And I encourage you to urge you , and I say , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s have a lot of discussions about how do we actually manage a dominant ?
Of course , you need to ask you why didn &apos;t you have a kind of thing ?
And the reason is that there &apos;s a lot of productivity to be uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do it .
Of course , every company would like to be represented in the first place .
And none of them didn &apos;t want to be in the first place .
And because there are more effectively that the first thing they don &apos;t want to see is that they don &apos;t want to have a kind of thing .
It &apos;s about 60 years of what we have in the U.N. , but we &apos;ll never build a fundamental way of all kinds of things that we can do in the world , and we can decide how to start .
That &apos;s not the most thing that we don &apos;t have to have any replacement , any manufactors , but of course , we &apos;re going to put a balanced place , but of course , it &apos;s just a hard way that &apos;s going to do better than if we decided to figure out what we decided to do and to do about it .
So I &apos;ve been suggesting that we &apos;re really aware that we &apos;ve had a lot of choices for a long time .
And very , we could do a lot of things , but we didn &apos;t know any of them .
We had no idea .
Imagine you &apos;re going to restaurant and give you a lot of women , but you don &apos;t know anything about the air .
For example , you &apos;re a virtue for a virtue , but you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
It can be $ 1 dollars , or a dollar .
It can be a family of a master , and it can be a little bit of size , right ?
It would be unbelievable to know that .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s trying to do is trying to do in the Arabic Arabic , trying to decide these problems .
And the dopranny of the sensor in Arabic was the work .
We invented the best economists in the world , for every three people in the world .
So , most of the most well-known economists were writing about change change .
What could we do ? What would we do that ? And what will it be ?
And they also have infected disease .
The big big worldwide said , what are we going to do ?
What would it be ?
What do we need to do for it , and what will you be the results ?
And so over and then .
And most economists , economists , economists , most of the best economists , including the Nobel Asian in 2004 .
We called them a dream of them . My colleague at the University of Korea , decided to call them the economics of the economy .
It &apos;s a good job in Europe , but it &apos;s not so good .
And the other thing , in fact , in fact , was a list .
Do you ask economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m glad that the question that you gave me — ( Laughter ) because it &apos;s a great question .
The question is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , how would we ask malaria ?
If you want to know about climate , you ask the balloon .
But if you want to know how to know from both of these two , the first one to fight to the first , you can &apos;t ask someone because it doesn &apos;t work .
That &apos;s the economists .
It &apos;s what we appreciate .
They &apos;re doing some sense of that in some sense , saying , &quot; &quot; What you need to do is the first one .
So here &apos;s the same thing that I wanted to share with you .
Of course , you can see it in the Internet on the Internet , and I think we &apos;ll talk more about it .
It &apos;s basically a kind of thing that says that there are bad projects — that are bad programs — that programs where programs more dollars .
There &apos;s a good project and good projects .
And of course , we should start doing this very well , very well , a very good project .
I &apos;m going to start with the end of the end , to end with the best projects .
These are bad programs .
As you can see the last vacation of climate change change .
It &apos;s a lot of people — and probably , you probably think of this , at least , where people say , I can &apos;t come back back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it because it &apos;s interesting .
Why did this ?
And I &apos;ll go back to this question , because one of the things that is that we &apos;ll have to ask your questions .
Why are you saying , &quot; &quot; Keep , or Niiiber is something bad about it , it &apos;s because it &apos;s pretty effective .
It doesn &apos;t mean that global warming is going to be going on .
No means that this problem is not a big problem .
It &apos;s all about what we can do in this case , very small and too much spend .
And they actually show us a technical level of economic models — which is that Kegeren — if everyone aggregated 150 billion dollars .
It &apos;s a huge money .
It &apos;s 23 times for all the last three times of the third countries in the world per capita .
However , it &apos;s a very small way to help .
And all of the models of the models that &apos;s going to look at a global warming in 27 years .
So , that &apos;s a guy who would have a guy who will go to 200000,000 dots , and you can wait to wait until 26 .
The one is better , but it &apos;s not better .
And here we can say , here we spend a lot of money money to get from a break .
As a solution to say that the U.N. was actually going to get out of this kind of money , about 75 billion dollars , you can solve the world .
We can make people cleaning up all the world cleaning water with water , district health and education .
So we need to ask ourselves to spend a question : &quot; &quot; Do we want to spend two times more money and do positive .
Or there &apos;s a lot of money going to do that incredible things .
And so this is why this became a bad project .
It doesn &apos;t mean that if we have money in the world , we &apos;re not going to do anything .
It means that if we don &apos;t have money , then this is not just the problem .
The average program — you know , I &apos;m not going to investigate all kinds of fun — like disease , health , politics , constitute to give you a little bit more like this — that &apos;s why not nearly so important — yes .
It can do very good things , but it &apos;s also a lot to spend too much .
Again , it takes us all of us to do that that it &apos;s a kind of equation in two ways .
If you look at a good programming , lots of water and water , programs come out .
And again , they are extremely important , but also required a lot of infrastructure .
Here , I want to show you the four percent of the four volunteers that should be used to solve problems in the world .
The top 4th program is a lot of malaria .
Two million people are doing this , a few million people .
The Karjan can even cut percent of feedges in HIP .
If we put 50 billion dollars in the next four billion years , we can cut these bombing .
We can prevent 500 mortality , but more importantly , we can prefer a billion people &apos;s risk risk .
We &apos;re going to give them a lot of problems to solve a lot of other problems , and of course , at the end of a long time , a global warming .
The third thing that &apos;s insulated .
It &apos;s a model that if we can go back to the favelum and especially at the U.S. II , we can bring to a new economy of five billion dollars in the U.S. economy , which is about 400 billion dollars , the third part of the world &apos;s greatest .
Again , we can say that we can actually transform 23 million people will get out of poverty , very quickly , very quickly , about two years .
This would be the wonderful job , three , wonderful work we could do .
The 2th job is going to focus on food .
Not just like any problem , there &apos;s a lot of limitations for a very cheaper solution , in particular , particularly texting with microbes .
There &apos;s nothing about the population of the world , gray , the Gold , etc . , etc .
If we go to 12 billion dollars , we can just give it a little solution .
It can be the best investment in 22 .
And the best project would be HIV for HIV problem .
If we go to 27 billion dollars in the next year , we can avoid a million of avoid .
Again , as this is going to focus on and everything we have to focus on HIV / AIDS .
The first is the treat , the earth is the preference .
And again , in the middle world , we had both .
But if we don &apos;t do anything , or not do good or not work , we need to ask the first question where the first one .
And the treatment is much expensive than prefer .
So that &apos;s actually where we can do very , we can carry a lot of successful programs .
The money we spend is we spend a lot of money , we can do the X from a good treatment and 10 times more .
And again , we &apos;re going to focus on the predators , the treat .
This is actually what makes us think about our efficiency .
I want you to look at your super-size size of your nucleus and say , do you think about it ?
Or would you look at this ?
Of course , one of the problems is climate .
I saw a lot of people who didn &apos;t think that this question is required .
We need to work on climate change in the solution of climate solution , not only for him , that &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we can &apos;t solve all the problems .
There are lots of problems in the world .
And I just wanted to make sure that if we need to focus on some problems , then they have the right problems .
What we can do is we can change a lot of things , not even though .
And I think — I think , Tomas , the name of us , is one of our dreams — it &apos;s a good way to try ...
People have forced that 100 years later , after we &apos;re talking about climate change , people will have a lot more and more rich .
Even the U.N. has predictable predictions .
It &apos;s that the average in 2000,000 world will be as rich as the world is how rich we are today .
Even more likely that they might be going to be here in 24 times more rich .
And of course , we &apos;re going to be rich at the time .
But my father is that when we talk to people , or 200,000 people who don &apos;t really want to help to help and look at Boods .
We &apos;re actually talking about a very rich Manhan .
And the problem , of course , is , of course , is it , do we want to spend a lot of money and spend a little money on 100 years ?
How do we want to help Bangela &apos;s real people who have the same time in this moment , and we really need to spend a lot of help each other ?
Or , as Shrererer said , imagine you &apos;re rich , you &apos;ll be like , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re going to be a rich computer , or the Dennan Congo in 2005 , and you think that it &apos;s okay to say , &quot; &quot; In 2005 , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re so lucky . &quot; &quot; And they think it &apos;s so much hard to help me that it &apos;s really helpful , and it &apos;s going to help you think that &apos;s
If it doesn &apos;t even have a lot of problems that we have our minds .
Of course , it &apos;s not because of course , the change of climate change is very good .
Of course you &apos;ve seen &quot; &quot; Williams &quot; &quot; after the movie , it &apos;s amazing .
It &apos;s very good in terms of what I want to see if I don &apos;t expect to see it , but I &apos;m not going to expect to eat the Hudson Peter &apos;s film in front of the next film , or &quot; &quot; Train . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It just just like a film .
So I think that I think there &apos;s a lot of observation in the Arabic and restayed in the whole fluid , going to change the problems .
In order to be able to understand that all of us is not good for us .
It &apos;s not because of the media in the middle of the media to do something better , but to create a better factory to create a better deal .
The next thing that I think is important , I think there &apos;s a lot of time , or maybe we choose choice .
Of course , we need to do everything in the world , the idealization of the world , I &apos;ve got pretty good .
I think we need to do everything , but we don &apos;t do everything .
In 1970s , the countries were developed that we needed two hours to make it better dark countries than that was spent in 1970s .
And since that time , we &apos;ve been helping to share a half .
So , in fact , it doesn &apos;t like that , we &apos;re going to have a lot of problems in the direction .
And then , then people say , &quot; &quot; What do you say about Iraq ?
You know , we &apos;ve spent 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that money on the world ?
I &apos;m telling you this .
If you &apos;re going to tell somebody about Bush , this will be a good deal .
But the main idea is that if you have 100 billion dollars in the way , we want to spend it all the best way , right ?
The real question is that we go back and thinking about the best of the German .
And I just mentioned , is we have the right thing ?
When you ask the most important economists , you end up to the top of the world , you will avoid waves , a black man .
And they don &apos;t need to be able to have a difference in the world .
So we invented the number of people in 80 different parts of the world , and they get the same problem .
It &apos;s all two things : they need to learn to college and write English .
Most of them , first of them were developing countries .
They had the same materials , but they could find out out of the event , and so they were doing things , and they wanted to make their own hiddles .
And the interesting thing was that the scale of all the things that were happening in the first cats like disease and the climate change .
We did it for lots of times .
The participants were very different , and a lot of students .
They were basically sending to the same thing .
And that was a great hope that I really hope , and I can tell you that I believe that we &apos;re going to be able to go into a certain sense of gender , and what &apos;s going to think about the world ?
Of course , in the middle world , I &apos;m saying , we &apos;d be happy to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where we start .
And I look at the Copranrandom of the sensors as a sensor .
We did that in 2004 , and we have a lot of hope to get more people and get more information about 2007 , 2000 .
And I recorded the way for the world as well as we start thinking about political members .
So , let &apos;s start thinking , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not do it . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s spend a lot of work with things that don &apos;t know how much things we don &apos;t know how to do it , we don &apos;t know how much energy to make a great deal , and then you don &apos;t start to spend a lot of things like this , and you can actually end up with them . &quot; &quot; And then we do things that if we do things , we don &apos;t do things , we
If we worry about some of the things that we do , we don &apos;t begin to worry about things .
I hope that this would help us to be better at the highest level of increasing increasingly and think how to help the world .
Thank you .
In 1995 , I learned how I was college , and my friend was traveling with a friend of Penneship , Robert Washington , Ready .
You know , we were young and a young farmer , because we had chose to go into the predators and the National Flung , and we &apos;d heard the long time at the long time .
In Harvard Delta , I went back to my friend &apos;s friend and gave me a question that he &apos;d be killed for 3,000 years .
&quot; What &apos;s the Chinese characters with that I see in the way ? &quot;
My friend &apos;s stunks look at me .
In the first room , you &apos;re sitting in the perfect example of it .
( Laughter ) And so I &apos;m still going to know , &quot; &quot; Well , all of the things that we see is that you see on the Chinese characters . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s going to look at me after a couple of seconds , and then I start talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
And here &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
( Laughter ) So , this is the pump of the solar symbol , which is the glamour . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about what we think about this , many of the things that are like , what we sometimes go wrong with our predators , and as we go to the cord , and as we &apos;re doing things that &apos;s what we say , that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing on .
In other words , Kurdistan says , I &apos;ve spent my last five years going to think about .
You may be surprised that I am an unsurprise in a long career , but I actually have a privilege of privilege to the high-competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , many of us are doing something that are going to be able to think about , to think about thinking about , or at least at least to think about the way we can be wrong .
Finally , we understand that very well .
We all know that everyone in this room is wrong .
The human vision , in all kinds of mistakes , is wrong . It &apos;s normal .
But when it comes to me , right now , it &apos;s all of the assumptions that I have , that I have a mistake in this time , it &apos;s wrong , it &apos;s an insane and I can &apos;t imagine something that I can &apos;t think about .
And here &apos;s how the problem we &apos;re all living in the time .
We go through the time we meet , we go on the vote for the time , we vote for elections and vote in the time .
In fact , we &apos;re all living our lives with a little bit of partner , with a little nervous experience , with our own partner .
I think it &apos;s a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for us to each of us as a personal , as a personal and physical life , and also for us , to take together as a society .
So today , I want to talk about it , first we &apos;re going to talk about why we were broken at your own partner .
And then why is this problem .
And finally , I want to convince you that I want to convince you that , and if you could be able to do that , that &apos;s the great thing that you can do , the great moral , magic , and what you can do ?
Why are we going to closed with your own universal sense ?
One reason has to be wrong with emotions .
Let me give you something , or give you some answer to you , because you are here , how do you feel when you feel wrong ?
Al : Very bad .
Suddenly . Okay , great .
Sousness , very bad , so thank you , they &apos;re wonderful answers answers , but another answer .
Do you say , &quot; &quot; What do you feel when you feel wrong ?
( Laughter ) Basically , you know that you can get wrong , and it &apos;s other things , right ?
I mean , it could be destructed by destruction , like this can actually be fun — like the Chinese characters , the philosophy .
But there &apos;s no wrong in the experience .
And here &apos;s a former .
Remember the Lupper TV , which is a cartoon , where there is always other musician , but it &apos;s never going to fly on .
There &apos;s almost almost almost one of the cartoon , for example , when a magaza is running through the horizza , and he goes down to a bird , which is normal , and he goes on , because he can fly .
But the field is behind her .
And here &apos;s what it &apos;s fun when you &apos;re five years old when you &apos;re old , it &apos;s no problem .
She &apos;s going to run away until the moment is when you look at , and it &apos;s looking at the air .
And at that time , he goes down to that time .
When we make mistakes , we still don &apos;t understand that we &apos;re looking at at , when we &apos;re looking at that sea , when he &apos;s still looking at the air .
We &apos;re going to make mistakes , we have a problem , but we feel like it &apos;s good .
But I &apos;ve got to actually direct my way before .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing like this , like being a lawyer .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s one reason for the structure that makes us hidden up and hidden respond in our own forth .
I call it a mistakes of mistakes .
But most of the majority of the most countries , we don &apos;t have any interface that tells us that we &apos;re wrong , because we &apos;re not very careful .
But there &apos;s also the second reason why makes us going to have a lawyer , and it &apos;s always going to have the privilege of our culture .
Remember the moment of your schools .
You &apos;re sitting in the classroom , and your teacher &apos;s stuck up to the tricks , and one of them looks like this .
That &apos;s not fair , by the way .
( Laughter ) And here you &apos;re in school , and you know , you know , if you &apos;re going to write a little bit about what the baby calls .
He &apos;s stupid , houses produces a lot of refrigeration , never does his work .
And so as you become five years old , you &apos;ve been learning about , first that the people who are going to do mistakes — that the second people are delighful , and the second person who are going to succeed , and there &apos;s a lot of mistakes to succeed in the world .
We &apos;re going to learn very good at that classroom .
And many of us , and I would say that most of us , most of us in this room — most of this country — is that the perfect lesson — only should be to become a standard student , an accorruption , a magnetic .
Now , of course , you say , &quot; &quot; Gladies , the physics of heat at any rat .
( Laughter ) So it turns out , you &apos;re all all of all of the most of the stories of the layers and the museum of Tony .
Okay .
But in that case , we &apos;re starting to be surprised by thinking that there &apos;s no mistakes .
Because we know that it &apos;s wrong with us that it &apos;s not something .
So we just argue that we &apos;re going to say , because it means we &apos;re smart , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re responsible , &quot; &quot; hopeless .
Let me tell you a story .
A few years ago , a woman had been invented the Tumor Treating Field surgery .
The Wheberg is Boston .
It &apos;s about Harvard in Harvard , one of the best hospitor in the country is one of the best .
So these surgery surgery .
He senses his senses , his surgeon , makes his work , put them back into a room and put him into a room .
It &apos;s something good .
Goke up , he &apos;s looking at him , and asking him , &quot; &quot; Why is it wrong ? &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the wrong of my body is there ? &quot; &quot; And because the one of the surgeon is that the surgeon has lost its surgery because the left is on the left .
When the hospitality of hospitals at the hospital , when he got a talk about , he said something interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the surgeon , he was sure that he was on the right on the left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This story shows that our trust is that we trust in order to make sure that things , we can be very dangerous .
It &apos;s going to be an estimity that we all have , and we all have a trustworst attached to the world .
But we do it in the opposite , and the exceptions that we can be the opportunity that we can be mistake , and at that time , like , like , Michael , 100,000 million dollars — more of the global warming of the global economy .
So this is a huge problem .
But this is also a huge problem .
For a moment , imagine what the lawyer does always feel .
It means that you &apos;re supposed to think about your beliefs in a reflective way .
And when you think , the problem leaves the problem , how can you explain that some people don &apos;t agree with you .
It turns out , many of us explained to explain it in the same way of absolute assumptions .
First of all , if somebody assumes his inevents , we just want to make sure that he &apos;s not necessary .
He doesn &apos;t have the information that we have , and when we do it all the way she will come to the truth and the truth will come from our automs .
When it turns out that it turns out that people have the same fact that we think , but it &apos;s the same thing that we think about our second assume — they &apos;re poison .
( Laughter ) They have a full image of their own portrait , but they &apos;re pretty stupid to get that conclusion .
When it turns out that the people who don &apos;t get to people who are not involved with the fact that we &apos;re really smart , and they &apos;re really smart , what we &apos;re doing is our third assumptions — and they know the truth in the third , they &apos;re the exceptions for themselves .
So this is terrible .
It &apos;s going to be responsible for us to make sure when it &apos;s going to make mistakes , that makes us so much about each other .
But for me , the most important thing , the most important thing that , is that together , it &apos;s going to be made of human beings .
So we want to imagine that our brain is like an opathy , and we &apos;re looking at the window , and we &apos;re looking at that window and describes the life .
We want everyone to look at the same window and the same thing .
It &apos;s not that way , and if you think , life would be boring .
And your idea is not about who you see the world as there is the world .
In other words , you see a special world .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine ourselves at one person in the place .
And we all do it in different ways , this is why we all look at the same night and see this as a night , and also this .
And yeah , that &apos;s why we &apos;re looking at mistakes .
There was about two years ago , two years ago to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about his famous words , &quot; &quot; I think I exist . &quot; &quot; Somas , and the Greek said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s some things that I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m wrong .
Australist understood that the ability of us is not a mistake of a creative system , but something that &apos;s not something that we can recover or destroyed or revegely .
It &apos;s a fundamental view of how people are .
Because in the case of God , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
And in the other way , every other parts , we &apos;re trying to try to find the answer .
Now , in my view , this kind of manufacturing is the source of sustainable and sources .
Last year , some of the reasons — I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m often hearing a lot of public development called Archie .
I heard , and I was listening to a moment , and I started thinking about all the stories that are going wrong .
And my first idea is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m crying .
I &apos;ve been able to make a mistakes of mistakes .
I see every mistakes . &quot; &quot; So there &apos;s a lot of mistakes .
But a few months later , I was able to interview the Gaza who was interviewed with Italy .
I watched him , and he said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re right .
In fact , we &apos;re embedded in the homes that the same way in our own damage has the same structure .
And the reason is , &quot; &quot; I think that this thing is going to happen , but instead it &apos;s going on another thing . &quot; &quot; And the answer says , &quot; &quot; The Gold man says we need .
We need those moments , surprised , surprise and discovering the wrong ones that for the rest of those stories . &quot; &quot; And the other people , our prisoners and the users will open the stories .
We love formagnificent change , unusual motivations , and in fact , let &apos;s come up .
When it comes to stories , we love mistakes .
But you know , these stories are because our life is the same thing .
We think it &apos;s going to happen for something , but instead of what happens .
George Bush believed that he was going to come in Iraq to find out of a massive destruction , to find out of the liberation of people and the Middle East .
But instead another thing happened .
And Muti was thinking about that being going to be going to be part of the Egyptian activist in his entire life while he would be able to be transfer and transformative .
But instead another thing happened .
And maybe you thought that you were going to be going to married and married out of your schools , and you &apos;ve got kids with them .
But instead another thing happened .
And I have to tell you that I was thinking about , I &apos;m going to write a lot of book , something that everyone hate in the group that would never be made .
And instead of doing something different .
( Laughter ) I mean , it &apos;s life .
I don &apos;t know that bad , but we make all these amazing stories about all the world , and then it surprised us .
Remember , but this conference is going to be the wrong part of our experiments .
We spend a bunch of week talking about innovation and play behavior , but you know why we need all these innovation and improvement ?
Because all of the things you &apos;re doing great things that had to change the world , in 1998 , 1998 .
( Laughter ) And it didn &apos;t work like this . ( Laughter )
So , what &apos;s my motivation is my device ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And here we are here .
And everything happens .
We all came up with another idea .
Another story .
Another version of the press .
In this conference , as a thousand times you &apos;ve heard , the magic is destroyed .
Now , in my view , if you really want to identify the miracle , you need to be able to get out of that little nervous , look at the space of the universe , the complexity of the universe , the ulnerable , and I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I think mistakes . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
In 1993 , on the Resesesesa , Amon , Washington , he got a man on the Misney Washington , and he sat down a hotel Senign in the Scott Institute of President .
The beginning of the final finding was just a result of women , but at that time , at the time , he spent a little bit of time on the wars , and so on the city , people who worked on the New York City , focusing on the U.N. , and the U.K.
Well , luckily , those farmers had been traveled by Four Buddha .
Well , unfortunately , in 1993 , the World Capartment were bombed .
In fact , eventually , will be judged by the judge to be involved in ways .
Eaie Maskese is my father .
I was born in Philibra , in Philibra , in the 1982 , his mother &apos;s Egyptian Egyptian , his mother and a mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother , who who worked together to create this kind of childhood .
It started when I was seven , our family started changed .
My father helped me to one of the Michai , which even Muslims have been able to see from Muslims .
It &apos;s from my experience that when people are interacting with each other , you don &apos;t understand that in many ways , that we all want to understand the same life .
Anyway , any religion , any people in the air you &apos;ll find very little bit about genuus , who are related to religion and think they need to use all of them to communicate .
A few months ago , after his hands , he gave me and explained that he explained that the president day , and his friends were going to go to Linna Lin-Lua .
He told me the next morning , I &apos;m going to go back .
And we got to go to Cambol to the sport that without the group of the group that was involved in BP .
When my name was to wear my father made me and explained how he explained to the sophile over 30 .
At that day , my last summer , I had the hidden cord , the walls that the lights were sitting in the lights , and I was surprisinging everybody , especially for me , the entire violence was filled .
My father looked at a different man , and he said , &quot; &quot; Arabic ? &quot; &quot; The father said , &quot; &quot; How did the father ? &quot;
They all sort of laughed at that point , but it &apos;s not just a couple of years later , but I realized what they were really laughing .
They thought I could see the same destructive destruction , my father was accepted .
The men , the men , finally , would be judged to get 1,500 pounds of scoffee in the World Center into the World Resus from the World Reptember Angeles Red Angeles Resus , a man who turned into a year and killed there .
These were the people I looked at .
These were the people I put it together , and I called a brother .
Until my 190s , I had been moved to 20 times in my life and my own childhood has never access to a lot of friends .
Every time I started to feel good at somebody else , to feel like to go to somebody else , and it was time to move into the city .
You don &apos;t want to have a new face , the face of the classroom I always become .
I hired my perception to the classroom of my class to not want me to be a crule , but as it turns out , it turns out to be a new boy who was a little boy than a kid in the hospital .
So , in a lot of time , I spent time time reading the book and read reading the video at the video .
And so I had no social skills , and I had a lot of social skills , and I didn &apos;t get it out of life .
I &apos;ve been taught people to judge people at risk , like a man or a rare .
So what made my eyes ?
One of my first experience in my life , who did this thought , was the preferation of 2000s .
In the war of college , I was able to get to participate in the Gaza Venezuela in Constitute in Constitute .
The other group of me was on a group of race , and most of the most popular life as well as it was interested in .
Our group were recorded by a different layers of life .
One day , I remembered the horse from the beginning of the conference , one of the kids I had been friends , I was a couch .
It was a few days before the fact came up until it came up and I realized that I wasn &apos;t natural with our enemy .
I never had a friends , and a friend , an unfortunately I was a mother that I was able to failed it , and I was able to destroy all of my life that had been depressed .
The other way I came out , when I found a work at work at Bank at the time .
There was a way that I was believed in many different creatures of culture and that became the experience of my development .
I was taught that the flavors was a blade , and the more match , all the things that had an opening effect .
This one was given me an opportunity to work with the magazine TV , and soon I found that many of them have been criticized , most people in criticians I &apos;ve ever met .
Now , when you look at the child , it has created a sense of suffering from others , and it &apos;s natural to come into a natural experience of what &apos;s about to be about about , but how I &apos;d like to talk to you .
The feeling of that , I was able to end myself in a certain way of teaching me by the real life and change .
I don &apos;t know what it means to be Darwin , but I &apos;m familiar with something that I &apos;m aware of things .
And then what happened is &quot; &quot; The Williams . &quot; &quot; And John Williams was a surprise to me , and he asked me to feel that he helps me about a relationship between a man , and he told me that there was no sexual relationship with a man or a relationship with a person .
He was a long model for me to give me when I needed it .
The surprise can be very often to come from a sudden , and the fact that the hitchen is increasing a lot more transmitted from my worlds than to the corner of my own father , which has no double to kle .
One day , I had sex with my own worldwide change , and he &apos;s something that I put on , and he &apos;s doing something that I live in my heart .
He looked at me on a soul of grass that anyone who would have a very uncertainty for living life , and she said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
At the moment , I realized how much energy is required that all of the quality of energy requirement .
You &apos;re not a real name .
I change my family , when my family asked me to end up my father and started new life .
So why am I doing this back and give me a potential potential for a time ?
Well , it &apos;s very simple .
I hope that I will be able to hope that somebody who is used for conventional violence , to understand the story of my story , and even though I was able to make it better , but I was able to make it savulnerable , but I was able to make a nervous impact .
Instead , I chose to use my experience for the leadership against terrorism , mortality .
I do that for the victims and the victims of their love , for pain , and so that terrorism has taken them in life .
I &apos;m going to talk about the victimm of the soundaries of the Gazine , and I &apos;ll missing my choices .
And in fact , with that simple thing , I &apos;m going to stand up here as no reason that violence doesn &apos;t have to look at any other or say that it doesn &apos;t take away .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s a sense of which it looks like &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about what happens .
&quot; &quot; The Face &quot; &quot; is important for me .
I want to know the people who are standing behind me for a choice .
I want to know how to affect them .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they &apos;re running around .
I want to know how hopes the water on the ground for themselves .
All of these perceives us to change the perception of us by measuting our genes from a way to recover our system .
It allows us to celebrate our glactor , which joy and joy .
So what do we call this ?
I think what we call is we call a revegetables .
If it &apos;s a long success , it &apos;s an instrument and to stop and removed from the reward to be able to be able to be able to be able .
The magazine is a factor of a smart and dynamic system provides an opportunity for the ocean as a resource to investigate a resource as we relate to the ocean , to develop a flexible and flexible flexible flexibility .
It &apos;s more effective , more efficient and more efficient in our environment .
The muscle of the chickens that the sixels are for a lot of examples of librate the librings , are very unusual tools .
Okay , there &apos;s a yellow and red red red red of the newspapers .
Again , it &apos;s very easy to go , and he will go out of his eyes , well , thinking about medicine , before you buy it .
But I think there &apos;s no enough to eat the green line .
We can &apos;t make this success , we can make a continuous way , if we don &apos;t make the size of the shape of the next thing , in order to change the track of the truck , including yellow .
But what if we &apos;re going to eat the green list ?
And this is produced by the Secretary of State , the Barkkelete Fardo — not be a kind of kind of destroyed — a kind of spaskerarchy .
Any violence , and nothing happened .
It &apos;s good for slakes . Hans need money to support the economics .
But it &apos;s the tricking , the primary of the grandmaster .
What is this kind of like ?
Would I give you a caused 450 packs ?
Can I do it for three weeks ?
I mean , maybe the green thing I &apos;m not , but I don &apos;t give you no the ocean .
So my point is that we need to have a mouse of what we &apos;re going on on on the most part of our actions .
For example , I &apos;ve heard that red red red red red a lot of health , inicica and alalism is useful .
It &apos;s great . I love the pink .
I drinking a lot of drink , so I &apos;m so healthy .
Okay , how much do you tell me after that , I have a problem ?
Hinet , we have a huge problem .
We lost a sense of feeling when it comes to our food , and we pay the value of it .
The question is that we put those value on these value .
We put it into the value of the value of the value of the value of a designing designing .
And we put it out to the value of income .
So the good thing about retraction is that it &apos;s given us our vote .
The magazine player can be satisfied by the best I &apos;ve been destroyed by Justin Coke , not Jerry or Golland , but it &apos;s like Golland .
So the trick : They can save the ocean .
Spain is like to say that the monkey is going on .
Okay , so I would say that my master &apos;s eyes could be used by blue .
We need to go on the top of the best stereo , if we look at the right , of course we &apos;re going to eat .
But what we need to do is we &apos;re going to eat a lot more sweet .
The best example of a magazine is falling , it comes from a half and a half of a half . Washington Sm.
It &apos;s given a mouth with 242 filmmmamaster Tums , with a sopophistick , and grass pixels , pink and poods pounds of pink and drinks and drinks up with a pair of pounds and drinks up with a little cake and drinks out of a little triel and drinks .
Thank you .
It &apos;s easy to seller .
And yet , it &apos;s as a component of all of these components going to be available for all the family &apos;s families .
June Olympy survival is going to save America from the way we &apos;re doing food .
Spain is struggling to save the oceans from our way .
There &apos;s an example .
In the heavy tribe , we need to be a virtue of fear .
And we had that Sunday , and then we started using our food food into our life .
So I think what we eat is wrong .
And I think it &apos;s time to change our food .
The power of inequation is something , but a business is that we all understand very well .
So let &apos;s start with here .
Finally , there &apos;s a lot of sustainability to take our food .
Dai Hunson and Huson &apos;s Vietnames are producing the green food food .
But the green food is always a kind of production which is for attention to our responsibility .
The only thing that is that the green system doesn &apos;t mean we need to pay attention attention to this sweet .
There is a flag in the environment of a mouth .
We can create them , we have this technology .
But we can &apos;t ever have the environment in the environment , not to eat a shoulder box .
It &apos;s not possible .
A very good job for reaction to remove into food into food .
And before we get off the barrier from the barrier , the vegetables , the media profound by replaced the propost-use use use use of the profound .
And they show that hundreds of thousands of Americans , dozens of Americans , their grandmothers , their grandfather can grow and their grandparents , if we calculate more , if we put more laughing out there .
It &apos;s a reward that I don &apos;t want to stop .
But it &apos;s not just about a symptomy .
It &apos;s about how we look at our senses .
As a high kid , I understand that the most thing I understand is that the most awesesome in my life is cheessive .
One thing will change .
I &apos;ll make more money .
People would start to buy bankers and stones , because they knew they didn &apos;t have a clothing .
People would spend more time on their food , and with each other .
In short , people get more than waiting for more than waiting for the time there was a little protein .
They &apos;ve got a little bit of calculated food .
They became a healthy woman . I made a lot more .
It &apos;s great .
The environmental approach , the approach has been taken away with you , but it has been replaced by the time of a collective content .
The other thing we did was we started to make a lot of variestors like this : Tradia , curiosity , biope , bizinia , all seemed to be common .
I believe , the flavors , the frozzes , the black black , black black , heat all sorts of things .
We attached to a more flexible flexibility , to remove away from recontractive choices .
This is what we need to appreciate .
This is what the green light says .
But this is also how we can recover our environment .
And there &apos;s a big deal in those days , this model of this model , the green tea that I was talking about .
Okay , if you need to give you a recipe for you .
It &apos;s very uncomfortable with any of the ocean , but there is this .
Now , let &apos;s start with a big million-50 pages .
Teep the door . The Keek a four fish .
Take them in four of the aesthetic .
Go to that four of his senses and then with the mastereo Buddha , you have the best color that you have bodies and sons .
Tony &apos;s going to be the opportunity .
Did you get your friends and neighbors to the neighborhood , and maybe a year .
I &apos;ve got huge waste from food .
I expected health and family and family .
I think that component components are made of stimulus and eating the most interesting human being .
My fortunate finding me that my father was wonderful .
And I taught a lot tomorrow about it was the privileged to eat .
I remember the good food .
They included proteins in stimulus , and they had a huge amount of waves with a lot of soccccer and little details , even though they don &apos;t know .
Before I die , I usually usually do that .
I do patients , when I go to the budry , they go into a restaurant .
I start by telling you .
It was like a white group .
It &apos;s a lot .
But the most important thing is that you &apos;ll hear and hear that you &apos;ve heard about the oceans in the ocean , I have been able to say it &apos;s the worst part of you &apos;re going to go right now , that the mother was right at all .
Three coln .
It &apos;s very right .
So what we &apos;re looking for for food .
An instrument , I &apos;m looking for a good component that are useful for my body .
For example , I &apos;m looking for awareness , and I &apos;m going to awarm things that I &apos;m not looking at the vacation .
For my family , I &apos;m looking for a recipe that go to my personal story .
For the community , we &apos;re starting to start on the past .
It &apos;s not possible to move from this idea that we &apos;re eating , is a global impact .
So , try and learn about the privilege of how it works and then the impact it &apos;s first to recover it .
We saw our blue dark planet , our bank .
But that &apos;s more than the resources of our resources , it &apos;s also the global community that we call .
So if you all take it all of the things we need to do , we &apos;ll start with the rest of the rest , we start to recover .
We need bangs .
We need to eat bangs in a little bit of a little bit accident .
And we have to save the lunch .
Thank you .

I want to share with you the story of how I became AIDS : AIDS campaign .
And here is my current campaign , &quot; &quot; The Scil campaign . &quot;
In 2003 , I was invited to participate the National Foundation of National 664 , one of the foundation , this is his foundation of AIDS .
And in 64 , it &apos;s in 64 , which was wearing Melhi when she was diagnosed with Ranger .
And here &apos;s me Youli : Yesterday Mutan , with my life — one of my life .
The next day , all the artists were invented by Robert , who was going to be on Mac Delhi , where he was going to be the issue of the global daughters on his side of the solar beer ?
And here you can see the window of this guy .
It was too big . That was all of us .
At the moment , the Michael Media found that in the world , that &apos;s in a gender , in this country , is that there are a lot of people from a lot of civiliza in India , and people die from the victim causing the victims and the sm caused by a lot of women .
This was a big impact on my perspective , because I &apos;m a woman , and I didn &apos;t realize I wasn &apos;t able to realize that MIV / AIDS has a impact on this effect .
So I got out of doing that , when I went to Harvard Africa , when I went from Karjjjan , I got to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I need to help .
And I had to give myself a travel . &quot; &quot; And then I participated in 666-year-old organization in which I was able to be able to be able to be able to celebrated by the entrepreneurs as I used to illustrate my African-African-gravors as as as as my grandfather &apos;s job with sopinitiation and my job of addresses .
Every one in the world will stop by Melhi Melelhi , every single part of the world &apos;s Dela .
But did everyone know what happened in Harvard in the United States , in fact that the country has the highest destruction of AIDS .
I think if there &apos;s money out of the street , and I think what was going on , they just will be shocking .
I was very lucky , very lucky , two years later , who talked about Zero , who , the RIV CEES , is his founded book — the transformed of Archie , his imagination , and his imagination was an epidemic .
I met him in 66664 of one of the projects .
He had a handle in a shirt wearing , so I &apos;ve been wearing it now .
It &apos;s already a tool to tell you that I &apos;m going to argue with people who HIV / AIDS people who live , who live in HIV .
And so , because in this point , it &apos;s kind of like a letter that I &apos;m going to walk through it , &quot; Yes , we can talk about the solution . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t seem to be satisfied . I became a MRI , and I &apos;m very proud of Accenture .
This is an excepted number of people in the campaign , which are 80 percent of the participants that women in HIV .
They work with HIV .
They are a tremendous amount of help in this way that people who live with constructions .
They have programs .
They had been drinking out of the sound of the signature .
The job , it &apos;s pretty good at all .
And yeah , I said , &quot; &quot; The Singinging-campaign , the National Actor , I &apos;m trying to use IV , which I &apos;m trying to take a lot of money , &quot; &quot; AIDS of all the money .
One of the most funding me was going to get out of the funding , which is going to go into Children &apos;s job and delicious job , and they &apos;re still going to train in Africa .
So this is my current campaign .
&quot; Fretty violent campaign in a campaign , basically , four or three people who help me and help me .
I &apos;ve traveled the whole world around the last two years , and I &apos;ve been working at 12 years in the country .
And here &apos;s a slide : Other Norman , I &apos;m going to get money on here . And I &apos;m still trying to check the money .
And I watched the burning of the Young Cyesterday , basically , in the middle African African , who were still used by the African African , because in fact , I use the heart of our hearts that are actually used to be an untouched by the heart of the heart disease and the people who actually need to be able , because they don &apos;t have this problem that people don &apos;t know .
The Greek Mexhia — the health of the Gollywood — also in this day , and I met him to meet him , and he got to see the infrastructure that have so focused on .
And this is a Scott Scotland .
At one point , I happened to be involved in Scottish HIV struggling .
I showed them to my experiment , and I tried again , and I was trying to take a lot of adolescence .
And here &apos;s the Museum of Empmpburn , and the great Mark Atall of Africa in Manhattan .
And it &apos;s like these children , very large , and they already have been running , their parents and their parents were forged by AIDS .
And here &apos;s in New York City , I &apos;m sitting in the Washington , and he went to NASA , NASA &apos;s struggle against the U.N. . .
And it was a great deal to me that Martin invited me a few months ago , just come back to NASA .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to put on my talk about the substances of my speech at the moment .
The best thing that we &apos;re trying to look at NASA is trying to get the world that we want — well — although , AIDS transfer from AIDS to transfer the 15 children to the 200s .
This is a very clear purpose , but we believe that we can get to the political support services .
It &apos;s quite possible .
And here &apos;s a woman who I &apos;m here with a woman , HIV , and we &apos;re looking at IV , and we put two colories , and we &apos;re so sure that we know that this woman has a very young woman , and we know that this woman can get a healthy woman to go into the world so he can take care of it .
And her child , she would get to HIV , who received a child from the prevent flavor , which means that the baby could be born without a viral .
Now , this is a virtual composition in the beginning of the very beginning of the life .
And so that &apos;s how you have to deal with this with AIDS lives of doing life .
Now I just want to end up with you a little story of a little story of Cathaniel .
And so here was — there was me — there &apos;s a crisis .
And I &apos;m telling everybody , because he is one of the millions of kids that have taken over millions of children , AIDS .
There &apos;s a mother &apos;s HIV / HIV , he died with AIDS .
There was also a disciplines who was born in Nathania .
And this picture was seven than one child per year .
In the course of her life , she had been noticed a systematic syndrome syndrome , so she was also suffering from AIDS treatment .
We met him in Qaaaaaaau , who has a whole hospitals , and took her every single night — just amazing child .
And the doctors and nurses didn &apos;t just see .
They had a special food for women to build and watching her husband .
And in the hospital , we don &apos;t know if we knew it in the hospital , because we watched her story — he would have a gift shop .
So it &apos;s obvious that it was a very sensitive experience that our identity memories , which came out of this baby , you know .
Five months later , we went back to Harvard Africa to find up to Austra .
I mean , I don &apos;t know if you can see my hair .
They &apos;ve been scared because I think I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the data that happened .
Is it not extraordinary ?
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , in the hospitals , the doctors , the nurses who were killed by Austra .
I &apos;m telling you a look like this .
So I want you to share one of you : One of you in each of us , if you think that every single world has a food and food food , and you believe that there &apos;s a family planning for survival , and you believe in the Hollylympic Hollylymps , and so I need to go into one of the 21st in the world &apos;s predators , so I would stop in the world ?
I think if I &apos;m going to be right , it &apos;s almost everybody &apos;s going to buy .
Thank you .

Good light . Appirt step out of the past , is a wonderful step out , and it &apos;s going to be able to achieve what it is going to do today .
As a download load , I &apos;m an administer , I &apos;m giving out the science of science and science and science and science , you get to yourself on the future .
You &apos;re probably all heard about Google Grap .
It &apos;s a new technology . So , you can see the world , and you &apos;ve got to see the whole names of names , forces , including the street , even though the waves would happen .
So this is what I &apos;m like a symbol .
It &apos;s a little bit more . The first thing we did .
When you look at a lot , you &apos;re going to put the golden apartment .
Now I &apos;ll show you what I mean .
We need only to play with a player .
So , let &apos;s call you the next time .
Very important . It &apos;s a very important thing .
Let &apos;s take it to play in the middle , and start with a place .
( Music ) The system is ready . The answer goes .
Their Teir Thael : For them who &apos;s not talking about paper , I think it &apos;s made of different than four , pooh , green , green .
The most artistic thing in the audience are doing differently .
Now , in fact , there are four ways of the airplanes to the airplanes .
Here &apos;s a rat . Fa.m. , bone ... ... My love : My love is fish , MS : Yes .
It &apos;s a magic of magic . It &apos;s like revegetables when the heat is returned into the heat , the farmer , the farmer , and then disappear .
Every kind of play has a 60-milliams — ( Music ) — every single eye of the scene — is the top of the prayer .
MT : So here &apos;s the spending out there , and it &apos;s the middle .
Knoon : Luclean is the most symbol .
MM : So in two galaxs , there were two pounds of walls .
So here &apos;s a pump that &apos;s a symbol and night at night .
Girl : I didn &apos;t know you can do it . ( Laughter ) So Tony &apos;s a toxic is that a coincidence has 52 weeks like that .
( Music ) SW : If you put all of the money on the galaxy , you get 35 .
MS : Oh , 35 years of a.m. , the number of years of birth , has been mapped to the mood .
Over the time , you put it out . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s not a letter ; it &apos;s not quite true .
MT : On the way of my birthday was for 6th birthday to me that I came up with a camera on , and then I went back to the world with that day and girls and girls and boys and girls and girls and girls and girls and women , Swel , and then , Michael , these are you . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And then Michelps are .
Art .
Jez : Hood : Reastan : Are you going to care about your time ?
Justin : I &apos;m Justie . TT : So see what you have .
JM : So I &apos;m using my bright now .
MT : So like color . Happy : Happh ! How , ! ( Music ) But ! ( Music ) But I &apos;m here to listen to the audience .
I &apos;m opening up to share you .
The letter : Nathaniel Tony &apos;s discovers : Sometimes people ask how can we be a nurse ?
Of course , not Ah . It must be dancing with 27 .
I don &apos;t mean words for 24 hours , a week .
E : A little bit of measured , but of course , it &apos;s all the things that you might say slowly sophisticated . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
And I just said , &quot; &quot; No , no .
However , German sound , &quot; &quot; Get . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s not so hard to give you so lucky . &quot; &quot; Even though I should encourage you to play with a player that if you play the money on the street .
( Music ) What is it ? Right ? All right ?
That &apos;s the probation of 61 .
MT : Yeah , but I think I think my play is better .
Kez : I think the birthday of your birthday was done . TTT : And so I still have the most important part of play , which is a games .
The difference that we see is not important ; it &apos;s not important to virtue ; not from the N.C.
DM : This is no , no matter .
Child : Robert . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
I want to show you what I was recently working on .
A few things I learned about the challenge .
This is a part of the day that &apos;s going to do a part of the day .
I never was so touched .
It &apos;s terrible .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
I was good at school . In the school was a big student , and I was a joy of steel , steem and roads .
And the way I was really fortunate with , it was an untouchable , and it &apos;s been frightened by people in the future , and the failure of the future I feel that I was feeling in my head .
And I went to the stage , I was going to go through my sixth , looking at the song , walking around with him , so on the right , so I &apos;ve never heard that I saw the voice he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , he said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s sitting on the room . &quot;
Look around , no , no one was looking at memory and it was crying .
He opens the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . So I started hearing the sound .
And it kept on days and then the third night , after the face of producing the face , what I did .
He goes into the classroom .
It didn &apos;t matter , even in a different time , and even a strange way , though I noticed that I was hopefully the sound of the sound and the sound of the speed changes , and sometimes my own exercise was missing .
So for example , if I was running into the hidden , and I had to hide it , which I was often doing my emotions , and then put it into the sound of sound .
And it &apos;s a magical research : the assumption that people don &apos;t hear normal sounds and hear the fact that I was sure that I didn &apos;t really have something .
I &apos;d tell a doctor at the University of college .
And unfortunately , I needed care , and I needed the help with him , I started talking about a symbol .
For example , I was a student at Harvard University , which was interacting with college , and a psychologist at a time , who said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m sorry . I said , &quot; &quot; Sir , you should go to the doctor .
That was the moment when the things started to develop .
At the end of a patient , then I had diagnosed with a diagnosis , and the worst was that the worst was that I hopefully was hopefully with a sense of guilding , and in my life , in my life , my life was inevated .
But don &apos;t make sure the sound of it as a voice as an instrument , not as a symptoms , but fear of it , it would be able to spread it .
In that time , that was actually a result of , a result of mine of my own instructions of civil war , a kind of civil war , and this was a kind of sophisticking of civil civil lization that helps the enezone .
Do you see , cold ?
In fact , fear , the inclusion , the dignity , the dignification and a spiritual confused , and this was a gift that I felt a gift where I felt feeling feeling and help for peace and unique power .
Two years later , it was a free reaction .
Until now I had all kinds of restaying in the restairs of didistrict district district districts , which I had — unusual habitat .
Now , at looking at that window , the hopefully , I think , if there was a certain point , someone who died at that time , others were lost .
And a puzzle and the man started this journey , but this man came out , and this man came to be saved , and it was become a privileged to be proud .
There are a lot of people to reduce me in my life , and I remember all their memories become soundous , so it removed me to the destroy people of memories .
I know that El Elunch was going into his disease .
You know , of course , in May , there &apos;s a lot of other , but the chair finds come up . &quot; &quot; My few minutes are not going to be able to die and nurse me for people who used to die and hoped me to death , who didn &apos;t die from that disconnect to that time .
First of all , it was very hard to believe that , because the sound that the sounds like a barrier and threw up , so in this very important way , to learn how to learn about how to learn , as I was going to speak in the truth .
For example , the sounds that they were attached to my house attacks , I &apos;ve learned to interpret the fear of the world and the idea of my own experience , not as a real idea .
So I first believed them .
I remember , for example , I had one night on my side of my bedroom to protect them and protect protects that I was to protect the actual cave .
That &apos;s what I felt like , &quot; &quot; Look at the bill .
Do you know , plastic have a virtuous cycle ? &quot; &quot; My prime .
Now , the most thing about this is , I was recorded in the last postory of my life , which I had been fined to each of the sound that I didn &apos;t have to return all from a medicine from all , but at this point of view , it &apos;s just from the perspective .
I now &apos;m very proud of the Institute on Pasctol Common , a part of the international political movement , which is the idea that it has come from from Robert Jesus and Resus is a piece of Jesus from the work of Jesus and Jesus , which is a work that it &apos;s going to make a continuous experience , but it &apos;s going to make a sense of mental illustrength , but to
The idea of published this theory isn &apos;t just possible , but it &apos;s from his own way .
In a remembering self , if they make social change , then it &apos;s a curious .
You can &apos;t check a man who &apos;s proud .
I can &apos;t pressure the people who don &apos;t care anymore .
In the last 20 years , the people who have created is a factor of five and five countries in the middle of these twins that gathered and collaboration on an abilities and rights that allow human rights to collaboration and create new technologies to create a new hopefully and hope for individuals .
As you know , Licklider said , a man who is infected by an accornerous and creatures with this emotional connection .
In this sense of society , there &apos;s no more glacier than the treatment of disease , the process of being transported to be able , for example , by one of those patients , to share the health and hopes for them .
We &apos;re going to reconstitute .
There &apos;s no idea that we can never come from colonically , or changed .
The light will never come out .
As a wonderful doctor said to me , &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; No , he said about you .
Do you know about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my photos here .
But does this take a picture ?
Of course , these are pictures that can &apos;t get you to get your photo .
I didn &apos;t start with a student interested when I came up with the first digital photographer .
It was taken away from my talk tomorrow , but this was a little bit different because it was painful the photographs of the process , and it &apos;s even more appropriate in the process .
When you take a picture of the balloon , it &apos;s when you get to click the button .
And for me , the photographer , the photo means more likely to be in the right place .
It felt like everybody can do it .
And I wanted to create a bunch of things that begins where the process starts when I click a button .
So here &apos;s this picture of roofs .
But here &apos;s a double library .
And yet , there is a director .
Or , this is the paintings of the same , and color , but all everybody has made a really good grade .
When I say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I mean , I &apos;ve got a reality .
Because of course , these images aren &apos;t really possible , but I don &apos;t always want you to watch , they look like it , they seemed to take them off .
Some of the things that you want to think is going to get a little bit about the data .
And this is a little idea of thinking about it than a moment .
But what makes it so real ?
Is the secret of the flavors , what are the colors ?
Could it be with light ?
What do we create the whole thing ?
Sometimes it &apos;s a leap .
But ultimately , everything depends on how we identify the world and what we can imagine is what we call the measure of the measure of the size .
It &apos;s not so fundamental , but it &apos;s what we think about .
And I think , it &apos;s very simple .
I see it in the reality of the things where you can take a different sense of reality and fold it up to another , but it &apos;s a reality .
Let me show you a example .
Here we have three dimensions of physical physical , which we can imagine imagine imagine a three-dimensional world .
But in a other way , you &apos;re looking at them , we can create something different , which is like this , it &apos;s kind of like this .
But in the same time we know it &apos;s impossible .
So we go into our brains , because the brain doesn &apos;t just make it sense .
I see the same image in the same process .
It &apos;s just a different factor .
Lots of students are even more stimulated , so I think they &apos;re not thinking about the things that are not thinking about , the things that are surrounded by us .
But in fact , you know the images , it &apos;s really important to remind it because it &apos;s wrong .
I &apos;d like to mention three simple rules , which you need to look at the same time .
As you can see , these paintings are not so special .
But we can make them look like this .
The first thing is that the images have to get into the same picture .
Second : the images have to have the same illness .
These two images are sending to two rules , they did at the same time , and they took off the same light .
My son : You need to imagine trying to be able to figure out where it starts and take them off without taste .
You must be missing the image of the image .
In the audience , by doing color , the contact of color and drawing the shapes of different shapes , by indicating the mutations of the mutations , like the muffffffffee — so by giving them a different type of color and coffee into a single picture of a picture , even though it &apos;s a picture of a picture that can have a picture of images .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) It can be , although this is just a picture of nature , and it &apos;s only the most changes .
But this picture was made of different collection of collections .
It seems to me , actually , it &apos;s really easy to make any difference than that , because you don &apos;t have to go off the blings of your ideas .
But it takes a lot of effort .
And the idea of doing this kind of sancestors , I knew that I &apos;ve got to make a few months , and I &apos;ve got this picture of the painting .
For example , this fish had been covered by fish .
The lights take another .
The most part of the painting was taken by the pirt .
And one thing , you &apos;ll put on the air , I gave me a little bit more likely to do it .
It &apos;s been able to get out of the time planning .
And I always start with this idea of sessness .
Then I start to show you different pictures .
Here &apos;s all the quartile project project .
And if you take a good photo , the result could be beautiful and at the same time .
And this is all the whole thing , and the only thing that we &apos;re doing is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Janny , the emerge .
One of the things that Lardo is Larry , your little girl , I &apos;ve done a couple of years in farms in the world to read the media .
Can that be true ?
Justian said , &quot; Yes . Can it be right ?
Well , it &apos;s not because the rest of the world are bad at their work , they &apos;re able to have a little group of groups that have been able to published on the borders of the world ?
CA : So how does it work ?
So how do people make false papers ?
So how do you make their secret ?
CA : So , these are the way we might say that the radiers have a series of roads , and we have a way to bring us to .
And we only use highest secret to use things around the Internet , to send them together , to go into different ways like Latin , like Sweden and Sweden to protect the institutions that we &apos;re invited to protect the answers .
We &apos;ve got to get a lot of remosphere , a magazine called &quot; &quot; or a magical organization &quot; &quot; which we &apos;re looking at the media , and sometimes it &apos;s hard to speak at a lot of hard time , when we &apos;re talking about it &apos;s hard to deal with district district services and then invitations .
CA : Well , you &apos;re trying to make sure that the silence of false papers , but actually never know .
JA : It &apos;s good . Yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll ever discover . And if we discover it , then you discover the ability to replicate the opportunity .
( Hoylon : The Greek .
( Laughter ) CA : So I think it &apos;s asking , &quot; &quot; Wow , which is why the New York Times . ( Laughter )
Let &apos;s see a example .
This is what transformed over a few years ago .
If we could look at this documents .
So this is a couple of years ago Kenya .
Can we tell us what happened and what happened ?
JA : So this is Kerermit .
This was a secret of a little bit unusual experiment , by Kenyan , after 2004 .
First of 2004 , Kenya was fighted by Dennani , 18 years .
He was a file of Kenyan .
And when it came to the U.K. , there was a series of sophisticated police , which was trying to feed the corruption of Kenyan , they gave them three million pounds , two million pounds of the pounds and turned it on the pounds .
And then the government used it , and it used to use Mr. Many , who was the most old man , and now the most people in Kenyan .
This is the final surgery .
So , I went to 2007 , and I went there and she managed it before the voters before the D.m.
When we published that , we published three days after that , after that , a new organization of the Cambodia , had been able to be a man with a noulder , and the captain of the Doulas , the Delas of the Delas Venezuela .
HA : So , short of the things that I think about is Kennedy staff because there &apos;s no directly directly directly directly . And that &apos;s the fact that you think of choice from choice .
JA : And this is the first of the Gandma Gandhi , and then mentioned , Kenya , all countries in the north and Africa .
And so it turned out out .
And that &apos;s one of the two days , an reason that Kenya was talking about it .
The day , after 20 days , they were replaced the TV , making 10 percent of the voting capitations , which made the result of the election , and what the result of choice was .
CA : Well , you know , what are you going to do with your fresh information that changed the world ?
JA : Child :
( Applause ) CA : Now , I mean , let &apos;s just show you a little bit of this videos Angeles from an aircraft .
Video : It &apos;s a long time . But here &apos;s a long time .
So this is a powerful thing — I need to give you a speaker .
Rooo : Get , the guy , the old Rush .
I am in my feet , let &apos;s go , four , four , just sope , slap — ck .
I &apos;m free . Yeah . Come on .
I &apos;m telling them when I sad . Tony .
Spain .
Look , fire .
( Music ) Singing ) Scottish in the Scottish .
hotel Brog : Brokken , Barkkkkitchen , Venezuuo , Venezui .
We need you now .
Well , yeah , we got a lot of farmer .
HA : So we see two miles away from the trash , and we see a lot .
Robert . I gave them .
Vuuuuel , this is Vuuuuuki , we move on .
Look , what happened ?
Hok , another . Well , the good thing . Well , I put it on . I put them on .
CA : What did this happen ?
JM : On the people who worked on it was a impact .
And eventually , we gave two people and sent them to Brada , and we gave the detailed story .
This is the first officer to attack that happened in the place .
CA : And I want to say that , &quot; &quot; Well , you want to say that 11 people &apos;s attacted , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I think that it seems to be two guises ?
JA : Two : Two children , Robert , two children had daily damage .
There was 26 million people killed in the 186 .
CA : And this was the exercise of the expression in this exercise .
What did you think about anger ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see a big geometry .
You see guys walking around the street ; they &apos;re walking around the air , then in a subway station , the Four-and-and-and-dollar million-and-dollar million-million-dollar pounds on all around each other — just to help the people who save the people .
And there were two reporters there that was simple that it didn &apos;t matter because it &apos;s a lot of work .
CA : I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you that the United States , the way I want to look at was , Bryan , who was arrested , and it &apos;s arised to talk about this , and he &apos;s going to talk about 2,,80,000 revegetables from the United States .
That &apos;s how ?
JA : Well we &apos;ve been pussed that we got this video .
He was about five days ago , a founding 150,000 degrees of television and published .
So , we went to the beginning of the last year of Robert was a deck from the U.S. Surch , but that doesn &apos;t mean one with the other .
So I mean , it &apos;s me that I had been sacked by those murder .
CA : If you could get a lot of nonviolence in the United States , a thousand degrees ...
CA : We would published them . ( Laughter ) CA : CA : CA : CA : So , I mean , why , this is it — CA : Well , all these kinds of materials like the control of human rights — because these kinds of manufactors like the real human rights — the real government , the ridiculous interruption .
If you look at television stations , you &apos;ll understand how materials are .
CA : When I remember a little bit about this .
So , there &apos;s no philosophy , what is it ?
Why is the secret of the things that are translated right ?
JA : Well the question about the world is the important thing about what these kinds of things can transform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
When we want to hide the economic improvement , it &apos;s going to spend a good signal when it comes to the speed , and there is something that there will be a good way to help us think about it , because the best part of the people who live on it — it knows it &apos;s about it .
And that &apos;s what we see on an experience . And that &apos;s the media story .
CA : But does it take a look at people , or really involved with the society , and it &apos;s not a transducer .
JA : For example , of our materials , we haven &apos;t seen anything .
That &apos;s where we have the includes of perception .
We have a special way to work with music .
But there are a lawyer , and the secret , you know , for example , your teacher &apos;s office — that &apos;s the secret with the teacher , but we have the job with devices that we have destroyed with rules .
CA : Well , this is what they think about .
And you would say , for example , you know , one of the parents in the U.S. committed against the government , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what you &apos;re going to published is something that you &apos;ve got to build an experiment .
It shows that one of the U.S. foreign fighters laughing on people .
That &apos;s what it tastes — it turns out over millions of people around the world , so we had the soldiers of the U.S.
In fact , it &apos;s not . That &apos;s my son isn &apos;t you attack ? &quot;
JA : Well we are listening to that .
But remember , people in Brodia , Iraq in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , they don &apos;t need the theory — they don &apos;t see it every day .
So that &apos;s not the way that they &apos;re going to change them .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It &apos;s going to change the understanding of the things that perceiving the people who pay for the things , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : Well , you &apos;ve found the way to illustrate it , which is what you think about the companies and companies ?
The light is good .
But not going to go wrong with the fact that in the fact that you &apos;re going to try to take your secret for your sources ?
JA : I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , we &apos;re still there . There &apos;s no limit .
We don &apos;t have the source that these sources are not separated by other sources .
If they get in the situation , they &apos;ll be able to do it for us , but we assumptions so people who feel devastated from our designing and not using it .
CA : I really want to really think that we &apos;ve been hearing about the worldwide — I &apos;m interested in Darwin .
You know , it &apos;s about two ways to look at Wangley and Jani .
You know , a hero of people , a hero of this light bulbs .
It &apos;s an old layer .
Who think he &apos;s a hero .
Who think he thinks he &apos;s dangerous ?
CA : Well , no . There &apos;s a few .
CA : Girt is a crowd , Jow , Jani , a crowd .
You need to try a little bit more . They showed them another example .
Here &apos;s something you &apos;re not going to lose , but I think that &apos;s the TED Talk .
So that &apos;s a curious story that &apos;s going on a new thing , right ?
What is that ?
JA : So this is a sad thing that we &apos;re doing every day .
Last year , the last year ago , there was a series of snode from Alasa , Alzaniel , the Chael , not so much .
And we got a video , a engineering engineer , the architect of the architectural research , which said , for the security security , some of the authority , was actually going to do all the street , and so there was this blown out there .
And the part of the government had to do something about the government , etc . , etc .
And the architectural engineering didn &apos;t have nothing before . And that was a very hard document .
We couldn &apos;t documentary it because we didn &apos;t know what it was about and what it looks like .
That &apos;s why we were a little bit effectively , thinking , thinking maybe maybe a fireman &apos;s company trying to get out of a fireman .
So we did it , and we said , &quot; &quot; Look , you know , we &apos;re going to come up with this nugent .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The countries look normal , it seems to think it &apos;s right , but we can &apos;t invest it it . &quot; &quot; And then then we put a letter from this week from what it was like , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so we wanted it to find it to find the source . &quot; &quot; And so we want to find it to do more . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot;
Stop , what about a document is a document ?
Can you show you that there was a lawyer of a document in that paper ?
Is it really really true to you ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us to this master called &quot; &quot; The Pophonhonhonhonest &quot; &quot; called Mophonhonhonhonest .
Ha !
( Applause ) So what &apos;s happening .
This is one of the techniques of our techniques , one of the techniques that we &apos;ve tried to try and write a letter .
CA : Well , OK . Anyway ?
JA : Well we &apos;ve had a lot , but in the moment , you &apos;ve had a lot of good engineers and a lot of observation .
And because of our publisher was last few months ago , it &apos;s been increased because we encounted the system with our enormous options in our systems .
That &apos;s a problem .
As any sort of manufactor , we organized a kind of kind of coincidentally , and that means we &apos;re embedded by overwhenever , and that we don &apos;t have very high helicitations , but we don &apos;t have enough to use these things .
CA : And that &apos;s the main causual , basically , there is a politicians , and there is there a censo-engineer ?
JA : HA : Hood , trust people .
So we &apos;re going to admit a team that &apos;s hard to grow up with materials so much of what we have to do with this — so we need to return people into the service , so you have to return the national security security for free , and then more low-free food .
CA : Well , Ooh , we &apos;re going to figure out what to do with us , and how did this job .
And I think I &apos;ve read that when you read a child , you &apos;ve got 37 children to school .
That &apos;s how ?
JA : Well , my parents were working on the school , and then after the conference came out , so on the ocean .
( Laughter ) CA : Well , I mean , I mean , you can tell you that it &apos;s a little bit of a composition .
JA : What &apos;s this job ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you also want to say , I &apos;m also a early early early on , and you know , with his early adolescence .
CA : Well , I was reporting .
You know , at the early early ago , I was an actor .
I had a newspaper , and when I was a teenager , and when I was able to pack it .
It would be like to be careful with the word .
I mean , there &apos;s a method that can be used for things .
Unfortunately , this minute , the most of us is used by the magnitage of your grandmother &apos;s grandmother &apos;s vote for banks .
And so that expression is not so pleasant as long as it was .
CA : Well , yeah , I don &apos;t think I don &apos;t think that you think that one of the grandmother &apos;s effective about the grandmother , but what do you think about the most important thing ?
Can we investigate some ways in the way , and maybe you might be able to help them get out of your life ?
JA : I don &apos;t make sure .
But the key thing — well , it &apos;s the most populous people that are not accepted by the victims : that their victims are not made their victim .
And that &apos;s something that comes from my father and a side of the father , the people who have been in my life .
CA : So , there &apos;s a lot of primary people who didn &apos;t create it ?
JA : And you know . And you know , I was an individual man who &apos;s doing it , it &apos;s not a kind of kind of kind of kind of thing ; but I &apos;m not going to go to the victims , but there &apos;s no way to control the farms that has access to be .
And that &apos;s something that I had been a long time in my nature .
CA : Well , very quickly , what happened to tell us about the last minute in Island ?
And in fact , you know , there was some problems that you had problems , after the media media companies had been published .
Instead , at the time I gave up .
That was a very unusual replaced to you in Island , and then what happened ?
JA : Yeah , this is a wonderful thing — you know .
This is the financial financial finding in the field .
In each country , it &apos;s kind of coffee .
He was the rest of the prison in his economy at the end of the NNP .
Anyway , we did this last year at least the last year .
And the National TV appeared to do about five minutes before the car was at the end of the time , as the programmer Red would read and read the media had been confused before and said , &quot; What would you do ? &quot;
Well , instead of going to make a website at that time , as we &apos;ve got to go all of the Denland , and we &apos;ve become famous to the train Island , and we talked about this problem .
And in the community , it was an unknown thing that this was never going to be going to be done with — and some of the international politics and the international lawyers , working with a new fresh line to the Islam of the Islam of Venezan Islam , and it was an extended part of the most popular corporation of the world to the international officians in the world , to the U.N.
Isn India is the dynamic in the country , and the North North , can use the system .
And just just a month ago it was accepted by a soundscape .
CA : Yeah .
( Applause ) The last question , Jani .
When you think about the future , I think you &apos;re more likely to be the High Line , a lot of money is going to be more friendly , which is we &apos;re going to put in the front of it all right ?
JA : I &apos;m not going to go to the situation .
So there &apos;s a tremendous amount of pressure about the law of freedom of freedom of the law and the law for manufacturing to the United States and China .
Deley is going to be going to be fair ?
That &apos;s why we live in a very interesting time . Because it &apos;s because we can move it into the air .
CA : Well , it seems to be thinking about the audience that seems to reflect on what Jani is saying , who was proud and failure .
JA : Thank you , Chris Anderson : CA : Thank you . ( Applause )
My name is Axy .
And about 18 months ago , I had a job job in Gorry , and I looked at this idea with this idea of artment , and I announced my art , and he assumed me today , and he aside me this idea .
And it was taken 18 months .
I can tell you very interesting , and the story of stories I can tell you about the city &apos;s interesting to young citizens .
But I &apos;m going to focus on democracy .
There &apos;s a lot of stories about what we decided to do this program .
I think my personal motivation is a very clear unclear thing to slide de on a slide , and it &apos;s the unconscious .
I grew up in India .
I &apos;ve got a great education , I don &apos;t even have seen the protest of these artists and many of the art art .
And when I started traveling and traveling , I learned a lot .
And when I was working in Gazo , I tried to try to make sure that it could be available to the new ecologists .
So we created a wonderful thing , a great people , and we started my work .
Yesterday I &apos;ve been demographic , and after a few things , I started working on this project .
You just come to Google at the Archie Pyl.com.
You can see all those museum here .
Here &apos;s the physics of Wall Street , at the Museum of the Museum , Emphony , Robert and Wisney Gaza .
In fact , I &apos;m going to show you the most favorite favorite in New York City .
And my colleagues would take two effort , which is very easy .
Will it . You &apos;re already on a gallroom .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you &apos;re in Bichael , Bichael , no matter .
You can make a spinning in the middle .
Do you want to break in a gallery ?
The New York Times and go up .
You see , and you have to go back to the end .
Go ahead , enjoy the images .
Take .
( Applause ) Thank you , but I don &apos;t even get to the best thing .
( Laughter ) Now , I am one of my favorite images in front of one of my favorite paintings , Britney Blo Matransds .
You see this money .
If you &apos;ve got this muscle to make this picture , you can push it on it .
This is one of the images .
So , it &apos;s all about eight feet .
They &apos;re really interested in culture , and they can push it into this , but I &apos;m going to move .
This is one of the images that we used to build our district technology .
So this image , for example , if I don &apos;t mistake about 10 words .
And many people ask me , &quot; &quot; What does that mean ?
So I &apos;m going to show you what means you can get 10 pills out of your home .
You can approach the image .
And you can see things on the picture .
This guy comes out to her face , the exhibition of his face .
But then you want to get a little bit of the photo .
And I started exploration , and I noticed that what &apos;s going on here .
And I thought , well , this is a very interesting moment , and I saw a picture of the kids , and I noticed something that these kids are crying .
I went to a little research , and I talked to a couple of points to my confves , and I found that this is called &quot; &quot; Barkton &quot; &quot; — in which case , &quot; &quot; on his kesday Tuesday .
And it turns out it &apos;s pretty good at play .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now , quickly , I &apos;m going to approach the punch .
Now I &apos;m going to show you the same , so I &apos;m going to go away to see how much it was .
That &apos;s where we were , and there &apos;s a picture .
( Applause ) The top is still in a second seconds .
So let &apos;s go back and go back to the Museum in New York , again .
So here &apos;s my favorite clients , one of my God — the night from the night . It shows you that I gave details to see the details .
What if you want to see on the skin ?
If you want to see how much Gandhi is really designed by this master ?
We spin a picture , as if we &apos;re in the picture .
I &apos;m going to give you the picture of my favorite painting : Ivan was a really close to the things .
This is the Big night at night . I think it &apos;s still the one I saw .
Now , my other hand , I &apos;m going to show you a lot of fun .
There &apos;s a lot of things here , but there &apos;s no time .
It &apos;s really an amazing opportunity . Niiber waves .
Each of you , somebody doesn &apos;t matter whether you have poor , you have big home .
You can create your own museum in the Internet , to create a collection of your own muscle .
It &apos;s very easy to go , we create something that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Nither the potential potential to change the picture . &quot;
This is the Humum Tumor .
You can look at companies and send your friends and start talking about what you &apos;re looking at when you look at these masters .
So I think the conclusion , as I think , the most favorite thing is here , it &apos;s not going to come from Google , come out .
Even though I think they don &apos;t come to the museum .
I think it &apos;s obvious .
These are the wonderful paintings that took us .
That was my experience .
I hope that in this digital world , we are uncomfortable with art .
And the most important question that I gave me , &quot; &quot; Is you going to create this : &quot; Are you going to create an expert to recover the answer . &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
This is just a journalist reporters to go .
That &apos;s the end . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m an example .
That &apos;s what I do in my life is telling stories , I &apos;m talking about , and today I want to tell you about a few stories about the art of the art , and some of the mystery that makes a little bit about , which is called &quot; &quot; The Gold . &quot;
But before I got it , let me share my personal story for a couple of years .
Of course , I &apos;m going to do that with words , but I &apos;m going to use a symbol and symbol , which you &apos;re going to take a few circumstances .
I was born in Smith , France in France .
And after a while , they were taken out of these women and I went back to Taniel , my heart .
At that moment , I grew up as a mother &apos;s greatest child .
In 1970s , in 1970s , it was a little bit extraordinary .
We had a strong impact on the environment of the surrounding family , where my family had failed , so I was growing up , and I was able to see a primitive environment .
So , in fact , I grew up up with two women &apos;s lives .
On the hand , my mother was good education , good , the world , the most most well-known people , the disample .
And on the other hand , my grandmother , who was also active with a lot of people who are also more valuable , but of course , to be less and less formational .
He was a woman who was proud of the coffee &apos;s clothes in the coffee and the mystery with the eyes of the eyes .
Most people would come to my grandmother &apos;s visit by sancestors or pixels , or pigs .
Every time my grandmother was words in abababic , it took me a red red red pump , and it took a little bit of pink , so they wanted it to eat the skin .
Suddenly he was in one hand , and he was paying a drink of a drink in the air .
A week later , a disease comes to the beginning .
Now I know I don &apos;t want to talk about these kinds of things in the audience , but the truth is that the truth is that the people who were in front of my grandmother &apos;s friends who were in front of my grandmother , I don &apos;t have been able to go to the bodies that there &apos;s no treatment .
I asked my grandmother how did he do that ? Is it the infrastructure ?
Well , he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praffe helps the book . &quot; &quot; But you need to learn about the power of the power . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;ve learned a lot of personality that I &apos;ve learned to live in a lot of personality , if it &apos;s a lot of sensasation , if you want to add somebody else in your life , and if you want to be sad , you to be a lot of human condition .
And it &apos;s from the inside of it .
Now , we &apos;re all living if we &apos;re living in a social and a kind of social culture .
Yes .
We &apos;re all born in a single family of a family , a relationship between the classroom .
But if we didn &apos;t have to make a difference with the world , then we could admit the world , then we could be the threat of energy .
Our bad news is : our hearts are going to get away from heart . Our humanity is going to remove , if we looked at our heat beat , we looked at our cultures .
Our friends , unlike medications , most of our partners — the family — the people — if we were willing to look at us , then we were supposed to be involved with our clinics .
The other thing is what my grandmother &apos;s women are like in Eastern Australia , and they put them off into a kind of perspective so far away .
It &apos;s the old Kurdisturge to believe that for the most healthy man is not for time to spend a lot of health .
The top of the stock line to look like , people who live in the world , are living in the most industrialized world .
And that happens most of the most popular men and the prisoners , the condoms and the strength of the houses , the poor and the poor and the Archie .
We go to the Graffs , which are based on this sort of based on the ground , and I think it &apos;s sort of silent sophisticks about people .
Now , I think the only way I &apos;ve been able to build these cultural loans : that &apos;s the expression of art .
The stories can &apos;t break the border , but they can affect our mental illness .
And here , we can open these postcards , we can recover other fields and see what we see .
I started writing from eight years old .
One day , my mother came home to a secret and asked the question : Would I like to carry it ?
When I look at the point , I think he was kind of interested in my soul worry about .
I was telling stories about home , which was kind of good at home , but I told my story about three companies that would be bad .
And I got a kid in the stage , in terms of the way I was talking with colorful colories , and when I was talking about it , when my mother was thinking about them , and I thought that it was good for me , if I &apos;m going to succeed to the emotions between my past .
But he didn &apos;t know that I was considered my life , and the last thing I was going to write about , I &apos;d like to write it .
Instead , I started writing about the surrounds of people &apos;s surroundings , and what happened .
And it became the whole story of all my life expectations , which is writing .
In the end of the earth , I &apos;ve been exposted to a self-impression , which was going to give a transfer to a different life .
I &apos;ll give you a little bit of a commitment . I &apos;ll take a picture of a doctor and back to that .
I go back to my story , in that time , something happened .
My mother became an expert .
And I &apos;m doing this little , a little bit of food , a average warrior from a janic killer where my grandmother lived in this country — so I moved to the international school where I was in high school .
There was the first time I didn &apos;t mention &quot; &quot; Department Natar . &quot; &quot; In our class , we learn from different monitors . We learn these different proteins , this symbol fuels that &apos;s a equation in our class .
The infrastructure created in a atatmosphere where everything was looking at children without so much .
We had a little bit like the U.N. , which was fun for thinking , in terms of the interpretation that were supposed to be involved in this event , whether there was a person or believe .
It was a child who has become an exhibition and falling line .
And I knew that , because when I was looking at that time , when I went to that school was happening in my country , it was going to be a little bit of man who had a little man who had killed a little bit of the Hollymphony and the Erison Prid Erid Miss .
( Laughter ) That day , I was often embedded in classrooms and dream .
There &apos;s the first time I felt a soundscape , which became the decline .
The other children asked me , &quot; &quot; The Eastern Empire &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t see a film . &quot; &quot; So I was interested in how many women were ridiculous , because I think all the horizes are curious , and they start to ask me how I start to start to do .
So I came to the conclusion that there &apos;s three tests of my country , alternations , politics , which is a bank and a cap .
And then from Spain , we moved to Hudson , Germany and again .
The most important thing I felt that my three times is the only step I can move to me .
The assumptions were going to be focused on , and a sense of a sense of a sense , these are three things I needed .
When I was 20 years old , I moved to Scott Broza , which I removed .
I lived in a lot of biography , a variety in social environment , where I wrote some of my colleagues .
And I was in Scott , when I was happening 1999 .
When I went to the morning , I took my eyes on a sophisticated device so I got off .
In a summer , there was a fear of snake , a man who never sold from a sophistication and never been talking about the public .
He was a formaker with a cycle to the next to a Stransident , who was long and forgotten away from the chest and forth , and he &apos;d forgotten the waste of the lower , and he had the waste .
I saw this man who worked with a sophile of smoking and sophisticated by the sancestors , and one of the earth was trained from the earth , and it was trained by a trained trained trained trained travel and went into the physicist .
Mark and million-gravity of our country , and we all make together together , even if it &apos;s a few hours .
But I always believed that the stories can also have a impact on us .
I don &apos;t tell you that the vacation has the same quake , the quake , but at the same time , we read our little dogs , we &apos;ll read our little hoods , and we go back into the night and we &apos;re going to detect people who we &apos;re going to come up with , and we &apos;re not able to have to meet on an elaborate person .
At one point , I started to look at women &apos;s daughters of Bank , so on Michael Hambodia .
I felt much of how I could change the world , but in language .
I started writing English in English .
I &apos;m not embedded , but not a restaurant , and I ask you — why do I do it with languages ?
I like to write likes in a language who write into a lot of equation and emotions , and I like to write English , which is my mathematical and mathematical and mathematics .
I feel like a different kind of accurate languages .
For me , English for the rest of millions of people in this world , is a global law .
When you start in something in language , you know , it &apos;s going to live and we live forever as anomy .
Because , as a hospital , we always want to say more , better than doing things , better things . But you don &apos;t know that we use a few things , because we extend to express a lot of magic and magic .
And that food is very frightened .
But if we were embedded of fear , it could be a sum .
This is what I discovered from Boston Baskton is very expensive .
At the time of my grandmother , who was in front of my life , was experimenting with sophisticated sophistication from its soundaries , so I could still stay so I could still stay in .
And because God love my grandmother , I loved my husband .
( Laughter ) But instead of working , I moved to Argentina .
And because my husband &apos;s husband , Sambodia , I started the center of Arabia and Scott , and there are two different parts of the world .
I think one of my sister has always been destroyed from physics , physically .
The psychologists have always accompanied me and memories of all my career and memories , and they act as a technological .
I &apos;ve been thinking of a lot of stories , recently , I started thinking about it that they lose their magic . &quot;
So I &apos;d like to say that all together .
When my first story was published in America , it was very interesting to visit a critician .
&quot; &quot; I love your book . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like you to write it in other way . &quot;
( Laughter ) And I asked him what he means .
He said , &quot; &quot; Look . You see very much . &quot; &quot; And the American village , there &apos;s just a picture of American , and it &apos;s just a codden . &quot; &quot; Because it was a man who was happening on the ground , and it was kind of like my perspective of criticians who had to be involved . But I found it was a criminal crime .
As I realized I would continue to read him .
He wanted to see my identities .
In the book , he &apos;s looking for a pregnant woman because I was afraid .
Wheever we talk about how the stories are changing the world , but we need to see how identity identity ty is what identity and identity is going to see the historic and redistributed , and then redistributed and resolution .
There are lots of authors who feel like this pressure , but unlike the &quot; &quot; Archie Murrice .
If you &apos;re a woman of death in the world as a woman like , I &apos;m going to expect of you , that you &apos;re aware of the story of the stories about women &apos;s preferences and unusual threatened to death of women &apos;s death .
You know , you &apos;re waiting for information , and you &apos;ll write information , and it &apos;s a different type of stories , and I went into an anxiety pasting on your colleagues .
What I felt felt like I was a little bit of a kid in March in the middle school .
Husers don &apos;t look at creating usual behavior , but also looking at their culture as they &apos;re looking at them . A few authors , a few of them — Thaila — some of them — from Thaila , Tunisia .
You know , all of us know , they &apos;re going to be part of something that if we &apos;re going to do , if not .
Art January , January of June 1984 , on the interviews of one of the interviewing questions about the flavors .
When the journalist was trying to make a few times the fact that he was a gallery , which he said , &quot; &quot; Budrus , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; No one is nothing else . &quot; &quot; No other people can &apos;t see me that there &apos;s nothing else in the city , and I don &apos;t understand that there &apos;s nothing else in our politics , when I don &apos;t relate to take out of us to the city .
There &apos;s some intriceberg categories called the pixic atmosque , which is called the attemporary scription of the world , which is all kinds of sushed in the world .
I &apos;ve never forgotten my first variety in the past 10 years ago .
Three of the authors — one of the Philippe , I — Thibo , from Thabu , and so on , Thajju , you know .
( Laughter ) We all wanted to change the reason why we did in the same artistic style or a magazine .
We had to connect our people .
In the top of the legs , it &apos;s waiting for me to wait for themselves to write the real stories , not so the horriors .
It &apos;s also a function .
That way , not only the authors , but the horizes to become the horror to become important .
But I have to give you a step and to see that the story doesn &apos;t come from the right .
It comes from here .
And first I felt that when I was 2005 when I slow up my court with my father just talked about the answers to say something .
I was waiting for a sudden when I &apos;ve got to write a set of habitat , a little bit about the solar woman and look at the bottom of the family .
My story made a miclllllo when it turned me .
I mean , criticized me , so others , in the very high conflict between the conflict .
Sometimes I wanted to get two dresses in front of the side that it was just one .
It &apos;s just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m just going to say a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to punch my work .
I want to love and interact with that exercise , not just for what it does .
The users go to extend to express their political perspective , and there are a lot of good differences in their politicians , but in this case , it &apos;s not a different view of modern language .
Behasn said , &quot; &quot; Clease solution and the right question is completely different .
And only the end goes on the author of the responsibility . &quot; &quot; Septemperity is divided us . &quot; &quot; Arabic is Arabic .
One is important in its preference .
The other thing , details .
One is building the border .
The other thing doesn &apos;t know the same .
The power of civil politics seems to be made by one silence .
And the capacity looks like water .
Over the Martin time , the Traphaniel , which means to go into the guns , and they go to the story of the juns , the horriors , the rest of those passions .
Every new characters of revealed the library it was changing the sound for its voice .
Everybody would go and listen to them , even young people , Janny , James .
The assumptions were separated from one of the other cases — like Hambassada — Najjjjjjjjjjjjo , which was very , very important in the north and in Africa , in Africa , in Africa , Asia .
Today , the stories keep coming up .
When they talk about Palestine and Palestinians , they don &apos;t usually hear each other ; they don &apos;t hear the Palestinian , the author , and the opposite of the authors , and the opposite of the other , the ability to identify with compassion .
It &apos;s essential to us .
If it can do it , it &apos;s bad writing .
The students were saved ; there &apos;s a lot of eyes like I was time .
But I &apos;m also familiar with the idea of the book .
When there was a scoffee and a Ranger , met his psychologist , and the first thing he came from from Thailand , and what he did was discovered by the water of the water , which was looking at the water .
Sustians say , &quot; &quot; The knowledge is that you can &apos;t take much more than the power of our culture . &quot; &quot; Sousa is not the amount of knowledge . &quot; &quot; We know each one about the problem , but we know that it is very much about each other , and we think that it &apos;s not necessary to take our knowledge .
There is a metaphor that I &apos;m very much of love , which is the side of the side .
One of the things that you have is an instruct , which is a truck .
Until , on the other hand , the movement is in a movement .
That &apos;s my point , and I think of it .
One of the things is in Scott Scotland , and the other side is traveling , and on the whole world with each other .
In this sense , it &apos;s pleasure to me , like my mouse , so in the world , and here &apos;s the bottom of you .
They were who had been in Scott , saw Texicon , which had been seen by the sophistick in Olin , and over over 400 years .
You hate , there &apos;s a little bit of favorite things — there &apos;s a place called Julian .
It &apos;s in the buildings .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m really excited by .
And then we are confidence with three things that are disconnected to the media that are doing things .
We look at them , we &apos;re looking at as an accurate idea like a junkler who looks like a bright , and it &apos;s a designing of body .
But as a result , we have the people who believe the films and the paintings .
When I do this process , I encourage the potential and change .
I love the idea I don &apos;t know what to happen after 10 .
I love when my colleagues are surprised me .
I think maybe one of the death of a woman &apos;s Egyptian &apos;s Egyptian . And it &apos;s probably going to be a very happy story , and maybe I &apos;m going to write a little bit about the magnetic Pamonnet .
If the stories are sensing from our heart , we can write something about anything .
The first thing Larry said , &quot; &quot; I think this is like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking . &quot; &quot; And so he invited . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s a great change .
But why are we the first creative work in the workshop today , and what &apos;s going to teach students about what it is .
Two things , it &apos;s not a completely different way for the beginning .
Yesterday , it doesn &apos;t need to be about who we know or what we know , or what our identity is .
We need to teach young people to open our hearts and write our heart and write what we feel .
We need to step out of our cultures and study others .
In fact , the stories were like spinning the ackets of the acting circles that were flying their walls .
They wired up the human nature , whether it &apos;s good . It &apos;s good .
I &apos;d like to end with my old Rush , which is a documentary film : &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re going to keep our lives , and we all love love , don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m Jesus Michael , I am a designer .
We &apos;ve actually given a lot of money in the world .
It &apos;s so far from the world that all of the participants and took 53 million hours to be used by the solution of the virtuus .
You don &apos;t need to be bad .
By the way we become , we become a more collaborate and a collaborator .
And as a result , we make social relationships .
five million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
It &apos;s like a lie . He &apos;s looking at why people look like why .
But in nature , this is not a situation .
We need to start the world with play .
By the course of play infrastructure , we had no doubs .
People were suffering . People were struggling .
It &apos;s really amazing .
The rule of Gloud , 18 years later , so the rog came together , so the judge has to play a piece .
We want to imagine a kindness , and then , after people wanted to help to build an evolutionary Tuesday .
We make this kind of play in 2007 .
It &apos;s an amazing story and it &apos;s about you .
We &apos;ve got a little graph , so we have positive skills of skilled skilled skills , like knowledge , knowledge , knowledge , the world , the enormous and the right thing .
My big idea that really , is actually a very small idea that can go into a bunch of billions of ideas like this moment that are living in our room .
And my little ideas is like this .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a blowing room in this room .
There are women .
I have felt a heavy experience with my face .
I was a fellow years ago at the faith of college .
My friends , I click my eyes , and I looked at my eyes on my eyes , and there was about five .
And I started looking at the print of the printing , from my pop .
And in the past , I learned very much . I &apos;ve heard a lot of doctors , and now , I want to tell you that more effective , the more inspiring and more empowered , you need enough .
( Applause ) And we have , women , we should become this new revolution , this new leader of the company .
We &apos;re literally literally trying to get the treat .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately , unfortunately , it &apos;s become a symbol of men .
At the end of my son , I had to do something about what was doing , that only four hours of the night .
I didn &apos;t say , even though I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I wanted to say , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you go to five hours ago , this would have been a little bit more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is a little bit of potato to show you a new kind of abilities .
Wheever there , in Washington , if somebody invited to invest someone , and we said , &quot; &quot; Four 11 , what are you going to say ? &quot; &quot; The best thing is that I &apos;m going to give you — but I &apos;m going to give you a lawyer . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to do that for a press , it &apos;s going to see that , and it &apos;s not necessary for the business , but they think that they don &apos;t see that
So high , I.C.
It doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a great leader because the leaders of leadership to see it from the beginning to see it before the TTI .
And with our Technology , we had too much satisfied .
And I had a sense of feeling that if Leardo , if the Lego , the streets of the brothers , the brothers , the water could still be water .
( Applause ) At the time , when all of those brothers were broken by 24 hours , sisters , probably , he will probably notice , because he would come to 7.00 hours and 7.m.
Now we &apos;ve got a lot of dollars in the world to get around the world — which is that it &apos;s useful for us — which is the joy of influence in our lives , in order to help our lives , to help our lives , to help our lives .
So I encourage you to explore the eyes and identify the big ideas that are used in our hidden lights , and you can recover the potential for you .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The story about the story is about serious .
14 years ago , I gave the first time to take this simple material , the gentlemen , the same thing was used to do .
Today , I use that materials to create money , money on the street , to give up an unequal degrees to the world around the Earth .
I was the incredible human doing that .
I didn &apos;t expect to be infused , engineering , architecture .
By the way , the college was traveling at the end of the college , and I got a travel from the school .
I watched my wish to a film : 10 years later , when I was filmed in the Fla , India got a program .
When I got to eat astronomy , I used to organize the mastereo , and I tried myself .
The exhibition would be day , and we didn &apos;t have it .
They had to do something .
The German in the village was known as a horse spinning .
So I tried a brand cooking .
But a big thing about changing work is expensive .
I went to sit through a walk and looked at fish like the fish &apos;s connections between networks and design .
Every day I saw it , but in this way I &apos;ve seen it was a different way I &apos;ve seen as a new scale of habitat , no materials .
I was inspired by the first cooking up with these fish fish .
Any , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Love . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Listen student on the network .
And unfortunately , the door will be flexible of flexible and reflect on the wind and changing things .
I was a glamour .
And I found an instrument to study and collaborate with intelligence , with sophisticated laws and so on the Arabic .
I loved it for detailed details that I had a result , but what I wanted was most powerful , transformed from the idea of the object that I looked at something that I couldn &apos;t move from .
Make a measure of India — we made a bunch of links — built a million network — a half , and a half in the time , a short time , using Mida .
And a lot of people saw — one of them was an old Kajjan , a Sololda , who was carried out in the city of Park Ranger in the city .
He asked him if I could make an instructive profound in a city like a city .
I don &apos;t know if I can teach it to my art ?
Any , engineering , soldiers , soldiers , constructive properties : the property of those properties were lated with the ethics .
I &apos;ve been looking for two years , which would take a lot of glass for a sunglasses and mosphere at the airplanets and so at the same time , but at the bottom of the wind .
We need one thing that &apos;s going on on the network of the network at the time .
So we had a look at 20 pour .
And we were sort of going to give a architectural engineer to give it a horse to a bird boat and a woman .
But there &apos;s no computer computer computer that could have a models of models , and a steaper .
I found an infant engineering engineering engineering in America , in America , a suggle of a competition of the Global Come .
He gave me two super-solving a problem with a high accurate and drink .
You know , I didn &apos;t have this in my own way that I couldn &apos;t make it , because the &quot; &quot; Buy &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t have a tag .
So I brought the conclusions with the door , I &apos;ve got to tell them these kinds of nations and look at them as well as well as he got them here .
There was no programmals that &apos;s this language of the traditional mammals transformation into the car .
That &apos;s how we did .
Three years later , two children later , I had a kid , took up to 15 feet and took a square like us .
It was hard to believe that I made the things I had done now , built the website , and that didn &apos;t lost anything .
( Applause ) And this was an ununusual experience .
Now , it was an opening effect .
The first shock was the first time .
Before I looked at the wind and looked at me under the top of the air , and at the same time , to be able to accurate with his sense .
My life wasn &apos;t going to be the same .
I mean , I &apos;m going to create a dozens of scans in the world , for many different cities in the world .
Now I &apos;m going to encourage two new ways .
This is the stories of the Forphyla &apos;s Delhi , and I met that the balloon would be far away from the balloon , and it should be more materials than the network .
So we tried the powder of the powder drinks down the drinks that went into the wind , transformed into the wind , so we also also found people to interact with this material and to move around .
And I use a sculpt materials to train the subjects in the subway , to think of the city in the middle of the city &apos;s output system .
The next challenge , Denign in the Dutch Somania and North Alberia — asked me if I could share one of the West Bank and 35 countries , their ability to create 335 countries and flexible dragging into the ground .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know what I thought , but yeah .
I mean , Philippe was the last time on the quake of the earththes and the earthes that had seen the ocean .
It was moving around the country of the airplanets , making it spending on the planet and literally keeping out of the mouth .
I found myself in AAAAAAAP of the ocean and the ocean of the ocean , and I asked to ask you about the data , and I transformed it into this .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; 26 : it &apos;s the microseconds of a microseconds to the Earth .
I couldn &apos;t make it build a postcard in front of my pocket , which I did .
There were no complicated structure in the surface .
The ceeal tubes , I replaced it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a fibers that was 15 times .
The United States now is completely flexible and so light , so that it could go into the building , which was going to go into the city of the city .
There was no computer programs that would look at these complex network and models .
So we had to make it .
And then I got a letter to New York City , and she asked this idea to reduce the New York Times Soman .
This new structure , a flexible method to give me a models of models and built scriptures that go into high meals .
Their cities , very funding , I don &apos;t have a lot of politics , I have no idea where there is most of them .
14 years ago I was looking for traditional tradition and animation .
Now , they give them a technology and an architectural solute positions , which are exposted , flipping on the airplanes .
My husband is at the end of the factors .
Here &apos;s the last story .
Finally , on the outside of the company , I got a letter .
Well , by the lawyer , he didn &apos;t have been interested in the art of the art , but now he never been running out of the art , and he was able to say that he was able to be able to sophisticated by the land .
There were religious drugs on those right now , so on the way they &apos;re looking at them with other people — looking at and watching the wind and transformed into the environment .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The image of this image is necessary to find your age on the horizon .
And after a trianging , we &apos;re very excited .
She &apos;s in six months .
( Applause )
I felt like a drinking woman &apos;s body &apos;s body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the human brain , you know that those two layers are completely born .
I &apos;m sorry . Thank you . That was a joy . ( Laughter )
The information is that the energy is transformed into all our physical system , and then it will be huge , in this process , which is a huge complaint of view , and the image of the eyes of the eyes , and how you see it , and it can hear it .
I &apos;m going to be a energy with all around the world , the right thing I share with the right of my own forces .
And in this moment , we &apos;re perfect , we &apos;re full and beautiful .
My left is the left , our left is something different .
Our left is the left of the left and techniques .
And our left is thinking about the left language .
And the only thing I can imagine is these energy .
And I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What happens to me ?
And I felt less and felt like my body &apos;s body .
